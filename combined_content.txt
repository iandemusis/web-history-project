Has anyone noticed that the port selector @ CSULB that allows CSLIP, SLIP 
and PPP connections is somewhat erratic?  More than half the time, the 
port selector hangs unexplainably when trying to enable a SLIP connection.
Also, does anyone have the appropriate settings (such as IP numbers, 
etc.) for establishing a SLIp connection at this site?  I'm attempting to 
get connected using Trumpet Winsock (Internal SLIP), NCSA Mosaic for 
windows, running off a 486 - 66 under MSW 3.1 with WIN32 installed.

Thanks!

Ye gods, at what point did I suggest replacing HTML in all its various
incarnations?  For the same reason that most people don't use
Pagemaker to create e-mail messages, I can't see the vast majority of
people wanting to have the degree of control over presentation that
professional publishers want, simply for their home page or their list
of favourite links.

An interesting exercise would be to write a DTD for RTF.  It looks
like the structure is compatible, and it would be possible (easier,
even) to write a DTD that has the same functionality as RTF.

> How many internet robots are there that will deliver an index of all

Bogus argument alert :) You might as well have said when people were
suggesting using HTML ``bah, how many robots are there that will
delive an index of all the top level titles of HTML documents
available on the web''.

Now *that* is a good argument against RTF.  That and the ``how does it
cope with font substitution'' argument are the best I've seen.  Let me
suggest that it could be just like HTML --- new versions aren't
necessarily going to be backward compatible, because things were done
dumb in the early versions.  It's no crisis --- just mark your
document as RTF 1.2 or HTML 3.0 or whatever, and let the browser take
care of it.

Fonts are more tricky.  Perhaps some standard aliases for fonts?
Times, Courier, ...

I'm only suggesting RTF for the publishing folks who want greater
control over presentation --- font changes, enhanced symbol sets,
multi columns, etc, etc.  I'd never suggest trashing the work that has
already been done --- maintaining archaic systems is the founding
principle of most of the communications on the Internet after all :).

Please identify the groups and their requirements you mention here ---
I'd be interested to know more about the people that RTF would
disadvantage.

[Note to Tim : the postscript version of the http spec in the internet-drafts
 archive is out of date (it's passed its expiry date, and several things are
 wrong. Can you ask somebody to remove it, and post a pointer to a more 
 up to date postscript version?]

As it now stands, ProtocolVersion is defined simply as HTTP/1.0, and nothing
is there to say that in the future other versions will be in the format 
HTTP/%f. Is this what is in fact intended, and if so, much the version 
be treated as an atomic string?

If a version string is unrecognised, is a server permitted to attempt to 
treat the request as if it were HTTP/1.0, or must it ignore any request
headers and treat the request as an HTTP 0.9 query?

Subject: Index & full-text archive of these lists
content-length: 1473

As I mentioned now and then, here and there, I've put together an
World-Wide Web archive of a number of mailing lists accessible via a
hierarchical menu system.  My system automatically converts the text of the
message to HTML, including making HREFs live.  The conversion doesn't deal
very well with detecting formatted text and it interprets all HTML it finds
in the text, since its presence can be ambiguous.  Messages are somewhat
threaded -- there are pointers to replies in each parent message.

The newest addition to this system is a full-text engine for the archived
messages.  I'm using AppleSearch via a beta of Chuck Shotten's
AppleWebSearch.cgi, through MacHTTP.  The archives are files that contain
complete threads with internal links.

This whole system is experimental, so I can't promise it'll always work
just as you expect, but it's been fairly stable for several weeks, so I'm
comfortable with this informal announcement.  You'll find a few menus that
might not work exactly as advertised and there are things that are under
construction.  What you can't see is the system I'm building for creating
and maintaining the hierarchical menu system.

Enjoy!  Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc. are welcome.  Please e-mail me.

YES! The CERN Library now has the hooks for supporting multi language 
error and information messages, however, only english is currently
supported. I am very interested in such message tables. It would also
be nice if we could agree on a common format! As a start I can provide
the danish version - I am sure it would be very popular ;-)

You clearly envisage a very small set of Web authors needing these features, 
which was not apparent to me from your earlier postings. 

On the other hand, looking at the hoops people have put themselves through to 
try and use HTML for graphic page design, it is apparent to me that a 
significant proportion of Web authors want control over layout and appearance.

Anachronistic comparison alert ;-)

Yes, when there was _no_ Web, that would have been true. Point is that there is 
already a Web. There are already WWW Worm, JumpStation et al. It is one thing to 
suggest alternatives when everything is up in the air and starting out, another 
to suggest changes midstream, when major bits of Web technology are already 
widely deployed and used.

You appeared to be doing that. I accept that this was not your intention.

Grin

> Please identify the groups and their requirements you mention here

This is the root of the misunderstanding here - you imaging a very small 
proportion of Web users, and I imagine a very large proportion. The problem was 
an inadequately specified target market ;-)

To see the population I am referring to, look at any web pages which use HTML to 
control layout rather than logical structure. Any page that uses inline images 
for things other than for Figures - for icons, logos, banner headlines, bullet 
points and other layout items. Any page that uses different Hn to achieve 
different point sizes. Any page that uses UL without any LI, for indenting. Any 
page that uses HR. And so on. 

All these people are trying to do some form of page layout, graphic design, call 
it what you will. I believe it was Marc Andreessen who said (but it was over a 
year ago, so I could be wrong) that we should learn from what the users out 
there are doing, what facilities they seem to be requiring, rather than just 
taking the moral high ground and saying, you shouldn't want to do that.

It appeared to me that Nat was effectively doing that, by sidelining these 
people from a widely deployed, open format off onto a different, as yet not 
widely deployed, proprietary format. However it turns out that Nat was 
envisaging a very small and specialised group needing control of presentation.

  I hope you don't imagine that a large number of publishers are

The whole point is simply this: can you give me one simple formatting
system that will suffice for every display device in the world
(including a voice terminal). I think not. One of the original
mistakes with the WWW was that HTML was specified as a formatting
system rather than as a structuring system, thereby bullding this
reliance upon display features that are both browser and version
specific. What we really need is a system for defining document
structure, and a way to define (possibly, even probably, device or
browser specific) stylesheets. Anything else is simply trying to play
the role of god in a world made by, and for, men.

I'm enclosing the lastest draft of the Binary Gateway Interface spec; the 
major changes are to the request handler interface based on suggestions and
more implementation experience.

Once again, comments gratefully accepted.

		Binary Gateway Interface -
	 An API for dynamically extensible HTTP servers

Abstract:

	Many HTTP servers currently support an interface protocol allowing
	them to pass requests on external scripts. This protocol is known as
	CGI. This mechanism is extremely flexible, but is unsuited to 
	high performance applications. In this paper we discuss an alternative
	approach to server extensibility and propose an alternative interface
	protocol based on dynamically linked functions. We compare the two
	approaches and indicate some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
	each.


Introduction.
-------------
   The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)[McCool 93] is a standard way of
allowing the manager of an information  server to add extra functionality to a
server without needing to modify the http server itself. This functionality
is achieved by starting an external gateway process, and passing messages to
and from that process. CGI is not specific to the HTTP protocol.

    CGI communicates with the gateway process through a number of different 
mechanisms. Information about the request is passed through about 20 
environment variables. Information about queries is also passed via the 
command line. For requests that contain information in addition to the HTTP
header, the additional data will be made available on standard input. 

   The gateway script responds by sending the result to standard output. 
Normally the output is processed on to the client. For efficiency, if 
a script name begins with a magic string "nph-", the output is not parsed,
and may be send directly to the client.

  This system is extremely flexible; however the design is not suitable for
use in high performance servers. There are several reasons for this. The 
first problem is the processing overhead caused by the creation of an
extra process to handle each request. 

  Secondly, the server is required to process any and all HTTP headers,
and to generate an environment variable for each of them before
passing the request on to the gateway. Most of these headers will not
be needed by the gateway module. 

  Thirdly, unless the "nph-" escape hatch is used, the server must read and 
parse the results of the gatewayed operation before sending them on to the 
client. 


A Binary Gateway Interface 
--------------------------
   An alternative way of extending the functionality of a server is to make
use of the dynamic linking facilities available under most modern operating
systems. If a standard set of function calls for handling requests is 
defined, then extended operations can be handled as cheaply as standard ones.

Design Goals
------------
   The designed presented in the following section is intended to meet several
design goals.

	1) Fast. 	     Extensions should be able to run as fast as 
		   	     built in functions.

	2) Lazy.	     Headers should not be parsed or evaluated unless
			     absolutely necessary.

	3) Portable.         Gateways developed for one operating system should
			     be usable on another system without requiring
			     extensive modifications.
	
	4) Simple.	     The gateway author should not spend more time
			     working on the interface code than she does on
			     the actual gateway.

BGI design
-----------
   The design is somewhat inspired by the Plan 9 file system, and to a lesser
extent, the extension system used for the System V.4 name resolution library.

The BGI model is based on the model of a hierachical name space. Specialised
handlers can be mounted at any point in the name space; these handlers will 
be responsible for handling any requests that lie beneath their mount points,
unless a more specific handlers is mounted below it. 

Servers do not need to use this model internally; however BGI handlers do
need to be told where they are mounted so that they can determine how much
prefix to remove from a URL.

Example: Suppose we have a namespace with the following handlers
mounted at the indicated points.

Mount point			Handler
--------------------------------------------------
/				file_handler
/image-maps			map_handler
/pictures			picture_handler
/pictures/office-scene		videopix_handler
/cgibin				cgi_handler
/search-me			wais_handler

A request for "/pictures/simon.gif" would be handled by picture_handler, as
would a request for "/pictures/simon.jpeg". However, a request for 
"/pictures/office-scene" would invoke the videopix_handler.
However, asking for "/picture" would invoke the file_handler. 


   BGI handlers  are compiled object code modules containing three functions
which are used to mount and unmount handlers, and to handle incoming requests.

Handler Methods
---------------

Init

void* <module>_init(char* mount_point,char* args)

This function is used to initialise a handler for attachment to a point in
the namespace. The value returned should either be 0, indicating that a problem
occured, or a cookie which will be passed to the handler function.

Unmount

int <module>_umount(char* mount_point, void* cookie)

This function should remove the handler from the indicated mount point, 
and free up any memory allocated for the cookie.

Handler:

int <module>_handler(void* cookie, char* method, char* url, char* version,
		     sock_buf* buf)


This function handles all requests on this mount point. 

Arguments:

cookie: This is the token that was returned by the initialisation 
	routine. 

method: The method that was used to invoke this handler

uri:	The uri passed for this request. All hex escapes will be replaced
	by the corresponding characters before this routine is called.

version: The version string passed in the request. If no version was passed,
	 this string will be set to null.

buf:	 This argument is a container for  the socket to use for this request
	 together with a buffer containing information already read from the
	 client.

typdef struct _sockbuf {
	char* buffer;        // pointer to start of I/O buffer
	int buf_size;	     // total size of this buffer
	char* end_of_data;   // pointer to character after  end of valid data
			     // in this buffer.
	char* current_ptr;   // pointer to first available character in buffer
	int sock;	     // the socket
}

Result code:

If no errors occur, the handler function should return 0 or 200. If an error
occurs, the handler should return either 0, or  a valid HTTP error code. If 
a status code other than 200 is returned, the server will generate an 
appropriate error message. 


Notes:

All handler functions must be re-entrant.
Handler functions should not close the connection themselves.


Library functions
-----------------

Server implementors should make the following functions available to gateway
implementors.


---
int handle_url(char* method, char* url, char* version, sock_buf* buf)

Used to handle redirections, so that a handler can simply compute an alternate
url and then have that resolved.

---
int http_error(int socket, int code, char* version)
Generate an error message corresponding to error 'code'

---

STAY TUNED - more functions need documenting.

Comparisons
-----------


BGI offers a much faster alternative to CGI for extending servers; however 
there are several disadvantages. The most obvious problem is that BGI itself
uses compiled modules, whereas CGI programs can be written in interpreted 
languages. Since a CGI emulation module can be implemented under BGI, this
is problem can be circumvented.

Also, since BGI doesn't automatically handle all header processing,
if extensive header processing is needed, this must be handled by the 
application. Adding functions to support header manipulation to the support
library would certainly help this.

Open Issues
------------

1) It might be better to have separate handlers for each method, rather than
   having the single handler with its operation argument. This would allow 
   different handlers to manage GET and POST requests. However, this would
   complicate the interface, since most handlers would only support a single
   method.

Currently, my favourited solution is to go with a single function per 
mountpoint, but to then implement a BGI module that dispatches to other
BGI modules based on the method.

2) Adding more functions to the support library will make implementing 
   gateways easier. I'm open to suggestions.

I found the article(s) to be incoherent. There were a lot of facts and
half truths brought up, but there was very little to tie them all
together.  There was no solution proposed; there wasn't even a
description of "the problem."  He also never actually condemned the Web;
he merely repeated what many of us say (albeit inaccurately).  And yet,
here on www-talk we seem very defensive. Why?

Personally, I feel the Mr. Hart would benefit greatly from a few
elementary composition courses.

However, his article, while almost indecipherable due to his
stream-of-conciousness (or perhaps just rambling) style, does contain
a lot of truth hidden in the half-truths and inaccuracies.

1) Network bandwidth *is* being wasted (not only because of WWW, but
   because the WWW has so much traffic, even a 1% waste is
   significant). 
2) FTP times are slower. Actually, I also feel telnet times are slower
   too. 
3) Computer programming *is* moving away from the machine. As more and
   more levels of abstraction are built in to programs, more levels of
   translation, and possible inefficiency are also built in.

(1) and (2) will be fixed with faster hardware, while (3) will get
worse and worse. I have fond memories of 2k and 4k machines, and the
machine language programming I did on them, but I wouldn't wish that
on anyone nowadays; it's just not cost effective.

I often wonder just how much header/message parsing costs HTTP...

   Extensive headers cause problems over dialup connections; a 1K set of
headers can add almost a second to the transaction time for every single
request. This order of magnitude difference makes the cost parsing 
insignificant.

   Header parsing adds about  25% to the total transaction time for the
NCSA server (HTTP/0.9 vs a set of 1K HTTP/1.0 headers generated by xmosaic).
Measurements taken on a lightly loaded ethernet, using a sparc 10SX to generate
queries, and a SparcStation 20/512 as server. 
   I'll try and do the calculations for Plexus and CERN tommorow or Monday; I
only added support for header generation to web-killer last night, so I 
haven't had a chance to do the full consumers' digest routine on this
feature yet. 

   The most intersting thing about headers is that about 99.99% of all 
web transactions, they are absolutely useless. The best way to handle headers
is to ignore them unless you know that they might actually make some sort
of difference; i.e. if multiple types are available for a given URL, or 
if a transaction needs authentication; otherwise, they're just a waste of 
space.

   The worst culprit is Accept; the negotiation format would be vaguely
defensible for a session involving several transactions, but is much too 
expensive to be useful for one-shots. 

I'll try and explain this more when I get the FHTTP spec out. I haven't
had time to finish this as I'm still documenting and commenting my multi-
threaded server <liemode> I love this part</liemode>.

	I clocked the new server at just under 3 seconds per transaction
	yesterday. Not that great, except it was running at nice +10,
	with a simulated load of 100 simultaneous connections
	with the machine compiling and recompiling the server in an 
	infinite loop, while I read news and used  emacs under X.

	(These figures were for a small data-set; your mileage may
	 vary depending on your hot-set to physical memory ratio. It's 
	 probably worth while doing some more detailed studies on this.
	 I'll have to hack the log analyser to get some numbers on this.)

I felt this to be the case, which is why I have argued for state
(multi-transactions) in the past. I'm glad that my hunch, and you
numbers are much in line.

Some of you may remember a proposed standard for robot exclusion
I posted to this forum last year.

In short it is a method of guiding robots away from certain areas in a
Web server's URL space, by providing a simple text file on the server.
This is especially handy if you have large archives, CGI scripts with
massive URL subtrees, temporary information, or you simply don't want
to serve robots.

After some recent discussions on the Robots mailing list some changes
were proposed, and a new version of this document is now available
from <http://web.nexor.co.uk/mak/doc/robots/robots.html>. Most of the
robots in operation either use it already, or have promised support
soon.

I'm currently tidying up the logging code for the multithreaded daemon, and 
I'd like to do a quick survey. 

Logging is handled via a similar mechanism to BGI; there can be several 
dyamically linked logging modules active at any one time; each logged event
is passed to each of them. The protocol for logging was developed to allow 
incremental statistics gathering modules to be loaded into the server to 
allow for real-time monitoring. However, an added bonus is that it allows
the administrator to choose the log format best suited to her needs. 

At the moment I have modules that support the only NCSA format, together with
the newer common format. I'm thinking of adding a module to support a 
binary format, so that DNS lookup of hosts, and pretty printing of dates can
be delayed until they're needed (either for access control, or log 
pretty printing). Has anybody tried something similar that I should try to 
be compatible with?

There's a peculiar point to Mr. Hart's style: he rewrites his
sentences in order to right-justify his margins without having to
insert spaces.  I've a feeling that this contributes to the

For dialup connections we realy should look into something better. A proxy
server at the other end of the dialup could have compression and decompression
built in to save extra bandwidth. The accept fields could be lodged with the
proxy and never need to go over the dialup line because for a given client
they don't really change from request to request.

The header parsing bit is a drag on everything, agreed. However the reason for
using it is because it is difficult to get acceptance for a binary protocol.
I think we should as a minimum make both systems interoperable. A dummy method
could be used as an id :-

NULL .. HTTP/2.0

I think we will have to wait for the URN scheme to make it work though. This
will make rerouting of different protocols much easier.

Potentialy they could be very usefull. Particularly when the data object refered
to is synthesized on the fly (eg database gateway). The Mosaic method of using
them is completely braindead however since it always sends */* at the end! If
it gave q factors then this would not be an issue. Mosaic could also save lots
of bandwidth by using one accept header with multiple arguments.

One idea we had a dinner last night is to have `accept groups'. To first
order one can infer most of the image etc formats understood by the user
agent id field. After all all mosaics are going to do gif and html, the
CERN linemode is going to do html etc... Now the problem here is
maintenance since the server must know what the groups mean... even if the
group was declared long after the server came up... URL time!!!!

Accept-URI: http://www.cern.ch/Accept/Linemode


OK so this >Looks< like we have an extra connection per transaction. Quelle
horreur! In fact we cache the page - cleverly in parsed form. So we only do
one extra GET and one parse for the accept group each time the server comes up.


I would like to wait until the URN scheme is a little firmer though. We don't
want CERN or NCSA being slammed by every server each time it starts up.


Accept-URI: urn://org.w3/Accept/Linemode/2.16.pre69

With the mappings

URN org.w3/Accept/*
    MAP	http://www.cern.ch/Accept/*
    MAP	http://www.mit..../Accept/*
    MAP	http://www.ncsa.../Accept/*
    MAP	http://.../Accept/*
    MAP nntp:

etc...


I think we should try to optimise HTTP within the boundaries of IETFdom first
before going for the binary system. We should also move to a binary system
in a coherent fashion in such a way that *any* IETF protocol can be used.

Also note that under this scheme a server that makes no use of the headers
doesn't even bother with the URN at all.



<STOP PRESS>

Aggh! I made a mistake here! Why restrict this JUST to accepts? We can 
generalize! Have a deferred header! Allow ANY header field inside it.
So make that :-

Header-URI: 


OK so I can't think of another use besides accept but one might appear.
We could also add in much more info into the header knowing it would only
be sent on a one off basis.

Sure...  Now tell me how you are planning to implement this.  Suppose
I'm using SVR4 style dynamic linking of libraries, and I want to mount
an extension at /cwi/people/ -- where do I put my .so file, and how do
I tell the server that it's there?  (As an aside, can I tell the
server to load a new version of the .so file without bringing it
down?)  Note that I'm not cynical -- I just like to know.

Is this done on a pathname component basis, or on string comparison?
If I had a directory named /pictures-huge/, would it be served by the
picture_handler or by file_handker?  (I hope the latter, but somehow
your example doesn't makle this clear -- especially since it
explicitly shows the reverse case.)

Who's responsible for logging an error in this case?  I'd like to be
able to pass an error string on to the client that's unfortunate
enough to be hit by this, even if the init routine can log its own
error in the error_log file.

Surely the cookie contains the mount point, so the mount_point
argument is redundant.  Also maybe rename to <module>_unmount (no need
to copy UNIX naming craziness) or <module>_cleanup (the mount metaphor
isn't too strong I'd say, and you don't call the _init function
<module>_mount).

I think you will have to leave the hex escapes in.  E.g. if a '?'
occurs in a pathname, it should be encoded, but a '?' meaning a search
key should be unencoded.  Similarly, Mosaic forms with METHOD=GET use
the form <path>?<name>=<value>&<name>=<value>&... with '=' and '&'
hex-escaped in name and value.  You don't want to lost this
distinction!

Just to be sure, this would be "HTTP/1.0" currently, or NULL for HTTP
0.9 GET requests, right?

What can I expect to be in the buffer?  A random amount of data after
the first line of the request?  Can I overwrite the data in the
buffer?  (I suppose so, otherwise a pointer and a count would be
sufficient.)

I'm sorry, this is totally ambiguous.  Does a return value of 0 mean
success or failure?  If a handler encounters an error after it has
started writing data to the socket, what should it do?  (Since this is
a high performance protocol, that could easily happen!)

> All handler functions must be re-entrant.

Are you planning to use multiple threads, or to call handlers from
signal handlers?  Do you provide synchronization primitives (e.g. to
serialize access to the stuff in the *cookie buffer)?

"Generate"...  what exactly does this do?  Write a complete HTTP error
response?  Can I write some data to the socket afterwards?

I agree with the single method approach.

Some ideas...  Decode % escapes in a string; (shallowly) parse the
next RFC-822 header (something like return a pointer to the name, with
the colon zapped, plus pointers to the start and end of the header
text -- possibly spanning continuation lines); skip to the end of
RFC-822 headers.

(Actually, at supposedly little cost, can't you use stdin instead of a
raw socket?  Usi fdopen(sock, "r") to open a FILE and then you can
just use fgets() to read the next line if you really want to parse
headers.  Having part of the data in the buffer structure would make
this awkward.  Surely fdopen() and fgets() won't be a big performance
hog?)

The configuration file looks like;

# mount-point	prefix		module		options
/		file		file_handler.o	root=/html

Restarting is a little tricky for multi-threaded processes; you need to leave
any active threads running until they complete, without making their symbols
disappear out from under them. The approach I use is to fork1(2) from inside
the accepting thread, with the parent closing the accept socket and thr_exit(2)
and with the child duping the handle onto stdin, and re-execing the daemon 
with an argument telling it to use stdin as the socket to accept on. This
can add a little delay to the processing of pending connections, but is the
only way I've found to avoid the possiblity of losing connections.

It all depends on whether you mount the handler on '/pictures' or on 
'/pictures/' (using the principle of longest match, this lets you achieve
either behaviour; the former behaviour is  useful if you want to mount a 
handler for users home directories on "/~".

There is no client at this stage; this is all handled at startup time.

You missed the really stupid problem here :-) I forgot about the possibility

Yes. It's not possible to break things down any further, as there is no

The data can be over-written as needed; the buffer contains any data that

Yes. A return of zero means the handler either succeeded or failed :-) It also
means that the server shouldn't bother trying to generate an error message.
A result of 200 means that the handler definitely succeeded, and the 
transaction is complete; a result of anything else means an error definitely
occured and that the module should generate an error message for the client.

The handler should return 0, indicating that the server shouldn't generate
any messages, and should close down the socket.

The handlers are all running multi-threaded; the library doesn't currently
export any synchronisation primitives, although the modules themselves are
free to use any services the host system supports. It might be worth adding
some wrapper functions to the library to make code easier to port.

Yes, and yes. http_error generates a response, and produces an error message.
The header for the response specifies "Content-Type: text/html", but does 
not include a "Content-Length:" field. 

Any extra data sent to the socket must be valid html code; the module can 
rely on the html document being at the start of a paragraph.

I currently have a header decoder, whose design may be changing, hence 
its lack of inclusion in the spec. The current decoder bursts an entire 
request into a data-structure, with defined fields being stored in named 
slots. 

The main source for new library functions is Jon Magid,  who is working on the 
cgi_emulation module by writing calls to non-existent library functions
and then asking me to implement them. :-)

s/stdin/stdio/ (I got a bit confused when the the first line was the last
line on the screen :-)

That's a possiblity which I thought about; ther lose with fgets is that it 
copies data from the buffer into the passed-in argument. There is also some
lossage when using stdio streams in bi-directional mode. Also, since  
the file zapper works by mapping the file, and then calling write with
the ptr to the mapped file, I don't want stdio even thinking about copying
the data into its buffer. 

However, I am open to suggestions on this.

Hmm...  This sounds very Sun specific (I'd be interesting in doing
this on SGI's IRIX 5, which has dynamic linking like SunOS but a
different thread library).

you actually tell your server to restart?

My point whas that the mount point argument is unnecessary here.  Do
you not agree?

What's the point of having two return codes?  Why not simply specify
"0 -- request completed; anything else -- generate HTTP error code".

We have a simplified thread interface which is ported both to SGI and
SunOS 4 and 5 and maybe other systems; it may be a starting point for
portable synch primitives.  Interested?

You may be sorry for the Content-Type: text/html header in the future
-- I'd say just write the response header.  Then I can also use it to
generate a 200 response.

Oops, do I understand correctly that you already generate some HTML
describing the error?

You can't use stdio streams in bi-directional mode, but you could
fdopen() two files, one for reading and one for writing.  For the file
zapper, simply fflush() the stdio file and to a write() to its
fileno() -- this is well-defined according to Posix and I'm sure also
in practice.  Doing everything using stdio will pay in the future when
useful handlers are ported to systems that don't support sockets (or
have weird sockets, like NT).

Solaris threads are UI compliant, which is very similar to pthreads; 
however the actualy mechanics of restarting a server isn't specified 
as part of BGI.

I use the standard convention of 'kill -HUP pid' to request a restart. However,
that's just me :-)

It may or may not be necessary; the spec could be changed to drop it 
and force the cookie to hold the mount_point if the handler wants it. 
I'm easy either way..

Just othogonality; 200 is the code for OK in http, so I thought I might as 
well allow an application to signal unambiguous success. Again, it's not 
something I'm particularly attached to, but it seemed a good idea at the time.


>

I have an application framework that I wrote to hit thread details; 
I've only implemented it for UI threads so far, although I did have a try
at a posix module - unfortunately, I don't have a machine that supports 
kernel level posix threads, so I haven't integrated it into the main-line
code.

I have a separate function which I use to generate 200 headers, which fills
in all the usual stuff; however, since I'm not yet satisfied with it, I 
didn't add it to this version of the spec.

Yes; the aim is to generate generic error descriptions in the library. 
At the moment I haven't properly coded this part, and just have a standard
message ("Error %d - it's buggered, lad"); this will be replaced by something 
more useful real soon now. I will probably be adding another paramater to 
http_error which would be a pointer to the accept_language variable. However
this won't happen properly until I get a bigger collection of internationalised
error messages (like, for example, Dutch :-)

Folks-
  I've just spent about 90 minutes trying to track down a problem with my server
only to find that it looks like the problem is with the client I was trying. 
Anybody have any ideas?

I was getting ready to cut a preliminary release, and decided to put in a 
skeleton bgi handler that could be used as a template. The example I 
decided to use was a simple counter that would generate an html document
indicating how many times the handler had been called. 

The module compiled and loaded fine, and when I tested it by telneting to the
port, everything looked fine. However, when I tried using the version of 
xmosaic 2.2 I have on my linux box at home, I noticed that the counter was 
being incremented by 2 each time. Checking the logs, I saw that xmosaic was
generating two queries for each URL - one with HTTP/1.0, the other with 
HTTP/0.9. I checked the headers, dumped them out and looked for suspicious
invisible characters, and even tried cutting the headers down to the bare 
minimum; nothing seemed to make any difference.

I then tried accessing the server using lynx; that seemed to work fine. finally
I started a copy of xmosaic on a sunos machine, using X over slip (not a 
real time environment). This also seemed to work fine. 

Can anybody think of what could cause this problem; is it a bug in the 
linux xmosaic of that ilk, or could it be a timing problem?

I can understand why getting a binary protocol accepted is hard, but I
would like to see a move in that direction. One other thing I'd like
to experiment with is using something like CORBA. My guess is that
systems like that are the way of the future, and that all things like
FTP/HTTP will become obsolete.

One other possible area where we could achieve a great deal of
compression is in the actual messages themselves. We can compress SGMl
tags by replacing the SGML GI with a 2 digit (hex) index number, and by
reducing the end tag to </>, and still remain textual. For the actual
message body, any number of quick, and lossless techniques will work,
and get an easy 12-25% reduction in size, and we still remian textual.

Of course, the precise Accept: header will be different not just for
each browser, but for each different mailcap (or other similar
configuration) file; i.e. it will be different for each site, and
plausibly different for each user.  This means the browser needs to be
able to somehow create a document which specifies its current accept
status, which is possible but far from trivial or universal, and
caching will have limited benefit.

Of course, if the server is returning HTML (as it often is) it can
just return it anyway without checking at all.

>I would like to wait until the URN scheme is a little firmer though. We don't

I don't think this would happen.  All Mosaics and linemode clients are
not the same with regard to what types they accept.

Accept-Encoding?  Accept-Language?  Ok, sort of the same thing... with

The other Romanian web page

letter doubling (damn, I wish I could actually *speak* or read the

For HTTP0.9 compatibility, if a connection to a server terminates with an
error, Mosaic tries to access the server again with 0.9 header. So, there
is something wrong on the client end in the way connection is terminated.
Bad socket libraries on the client side can also generate this.

I suppose using Posix threads rather than a proprietary implementation or 
several is out of the question? Just in the interests of long term portability. 
OSF/1 on our KSR has Posix threads - so, oddly, does the workstation on my desk, 
which runs OpenVMS.

Does that count as agreement?

Hi there
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VMS USER ONLY....
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is now a separate mailing list for those people that would like to try 
out the new server software for VMS (under field test).

Updates on the field test versions will be sent to this list ONLY. Stable 
versions will be announced on www-talk and www-announce. If you want a stable
version there is NO need to join this list.

Those people who have received a separate mail are already on the list.
If they want they can be removed.

If you want to join, send a mail to 

duns@vxdeop.cern.ch

Full Posix threads are way more complicated than what is needed here I

I was arguing in favor of using stdio streams to encapsulate the
buffering.  Simin hasn't said yes or no about this yet.

Most 14.4 modems now are compressing modems and they usually go SLOWER when
you try to stuff already compressed stuff through them.  It is best to
leave compression/decompression to the transport level to solve.

W3A, the WWW Applets API that I proposed a little over a week ago, has
been expanded somewhat. There are now examples of actual applets and
there is a document with questions and open issues. If you're
interested in writing or enhancing WWW clients, you should definitely
take a look.

I have tried to answer the questions that have been sent to me, but I
can't answer all of them. I hope somebody else can.

Please take a look at <http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A/W3A.html>. You
can also pick up Postscript versions of the specification from the
directory <http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A>. The questions (and
answers) are in <http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A/Q-and-A.html>.

If you know of other proposals for adding applets, accessories, modules,
whatever to WWW browsers, please let me know. I've heard from several
people that others are thinking about it, but so far I haven't seen
any concrete specifications.


Bert

PS. I'm also looking for a more catchy name than `W3A', how about
`CCI'?

That's more a user interface bug, and not a feature.  While they shouldn't
change often the user should be able to tell the client it really *wants*
postscript for this request and it should happen correctly.

There are actually 2 reasons why the Accept headers should be dynamic:

  1) the user may (temporarily) prefer format X
  2) acceptance of in-line documents depends on the context

If this idea would lead to significant reduction in HTTP overhead then
that's fine.  But how do we know this is the case?  I know that sometimes
the header (e.g. Mosaic's 1K header) is as big or bigger than the document.
On the other hand, some documents are huge and so the header is insignificant.

It would be good to have real numbers to estimate the expected reduction.
Then we can compare this with the added complexity in the protocol.  I
assume this extension would be optional, not mandatory, right?  If optional,
how would a client know whether the server supported it?

It also sounds like this is trying to make an end-run around
statelessness, since the idea would really only work if the server
caches the Accept-URI or Header-URI.  In otherwords, you've introduced
state into the protocol, but not in a very clean way.  Maybe a better
answer is that high performance HTTP (HPHTTP) will have to be stateful.
It might be better to keep HTTP real simple.

   Most 14.4 modems now are compressing modems and they usually go SLOWER when
   you try to stuff already compressed stuff through them.  It is best to
   leave compression/decompression to the transport level to solve.

One observation that I have made is that http 
doesn't gracefully share slow ie 14.4k lines.
If I am loading a large item (picture, tarfile
or anything 30k or more) and I start receiving 
an email the http download will pause. After the
message has completed it may take as long as
two minutes before the data picks up where 
it left off.

I have done two simultaneous anon ftps on the
same line and they seem to share the transfers
fairly equally so I think that the OS (Solaris 2.3)
does a good job of allocating bandwidth.

Faster HTTP to me would be cutting down that 
pause in transmission if possible, or making it 
a tuneable item.

I've cut a preview release of the multithreaded daemon for solaris. You 
can grab it from <a href="http://elanor.oit.unc.edu/">. 

I've currently cut a binary release, which is in Solaris package format,
and installs into /opt/mdma; I've also taken a snapshot of the source tree,
which is *definitely* not for the squeamish. 

The readme follows at the end of the message. 

Simon // Remember, this is MDMA so you have to be nice to me

-----------
MDMA -  Multithreaded Daemon for Multimedia Access

	Simon Spero (ses@unc.edu)

Welcome to pre-alpha release 0.1 of MDMA. MDMA is a new HTTP server
for solaris.  on very busy servers like sunsite or ncsa, which handle
over 100,000 requests a day.

MDMA has loads of neat stuff like multithreading, BGI support,
stackable log modules, which I'll write about more when my hands don't hurt
so much.

How to Get:
-----------

MDMA is available via the web from

http://elanor.oit.unc.edu/mdma.html

[NC-17] THIS IS A SNEAK-PREVIEW PRE-ALPHA (i.e. badly broken) RELEASE
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It's not house-trained. It probably won't work. Don't try and use this
release for anything useful.  We have made every effort to ensure that
all bits in this package are either 0 or 1. However, these bits may not
be in the correct order and proportion. 

Anyone found laughing at the code will be shot at dawn.
--

Known Missing stuff

	Documentation.
	Error Message generation.
	POST support in default file handler.
	Decent examples
	
Things that will change:

	Logging protocol; the protocol for log handlers will be changed to
	allow a handler to be called for different loggable events

New BGI modules needed:

	MAPS	Port of ismap handler to BGI
	CGI	Support for legacy applications :-) 
	TCL	BGI module with embedded TCL interpreter.
	USER	Support for user name lookup.

Can somebody explain why the http2 spec says to send URI but the NCSA server
sends LOCATION?

Does any client recognize the URI header in this context?

Under what circumstances is 303 used?

	I've made an addition to imagemap.  If one or more "point"
entries appear in the list, and no region-based (ie, non-point) entry
succeeds, the closest (in the usual metric) point will be selected.

	This is really great for demos!  No more worries about radii,
or positioning boxes just so, ot that areas may be left uncovered.
Just find the center of each of your targets, write them down, etc.

	I have a second modification which I found useful.  I created
a version of imagemap as a filter: input coordinates on the command
line, mapping commands on standard input, result on standard output.

	I have three questions for the group:

1)	Has anyone else made changes like these?  If so, I
	apologize for the redundancy. :-)

2)	Is there interest in these changes?  In particular, are the
	writers of high-performance servrs or imagemap-creating tools
	interested in adding "point" to their repertoire?

3)	If there is interest, how shall I post the mods?

	1) advertise a URL?

	2) post diffs or all of imagemap (it's small, after all)
	   to www-talk?

	3) submit modified source to NCSA, CERN, etc.?

	4) Are Kevin Hughes or Rob McCool maintaining an "official"

If you have a different accept header then you are most likely to be adding
extra accepts in rather than subtracting (Yuk! I don't want Gifs ... ?).

I don't think we should get hung up about the 5% or 1% of cases which are
different. Nobody is suggesting getting rid of Accept headers altogether.
Its just an optimisation that can be applied for a large number of cases.


In general I would like to suggest a principle that *ALL* areas where there
is a degree of flexibility should be referenced via URLs. If we tried to
compress accept groups in a static manner then there would always be a problem 
when new accept groups were declared. URLs allow us to deffer the specification,
and more importantly distribute it.

The same arguments apply for the security scheme. I am now experimenting with
sending certificates about attached to URLs or URNs. Eg if we want to
protect the traversal of an anchor :-

<a href="http://fat.freddy.edu/cat.html", crypt="http://fat.freddy.edu/keycert">
You don't want to be seen looking at this!</a>


With URNs all this gets much easier. The keycert then becomes an interesting
subcase, the DN is after all a URN (of sorts) even though it has an odd 
syntax. We should have a translitteration service n'est pas?


Personaly I think the big gain is compressing the body while sending. If
anyone has a bunch of compression routines I can plug 'em in. I looked
at GZIP but there are hiddeous numbers of static and global variables. Anything
in the library has to be reentrant so that we can go multithreaded.

Of course if your modem compresseth then you want to be able to turn this
stuff off. But there are still many who are cast into the outer darkness
with much wailing and gnashing of teeth etc. etc.

Subject: CD titles with Mosaic
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
content-length: 890


Hi Folks, 

I'm helping develop a Mosaic home page for a Science Center/Museum.
The Center wants to make this available to local schools on a CD-Rom also,
specifically those that do not have access to the internet. Since some
schools have PC's and some have Mac's, I want to store pictures/graphics
and video clips in a format that can be viewed on these platforms.
My question to you is this:

1. Is it possible to author a CD with Mosaic? 
2. If so can anyone recommend formats to store these files such that
   I dont have to worry about maintaining separate formats for
   separate platforms:
3. Common viewers for these formats (xv, mpeg_play etc) and platforms.
   I dont want to maintain different viewers for PCs and Macs.

If this is the wrong forum for such questions, accept my apologies.
Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

HTTP is just another TCP connection.  How can your networking software
which round robins the connections tell the difference between this and
an FTP data connection ?

I use serial networking to a Windows PC and do not see the problem you
mentioned above.  Perhaps it is related to your flavor of networking
software ?

The same goes for the CERN server. I think the reason is that the
implementation was done prior to the spec??

> Does any client recognize the URI header in this context?

The CERN Line Mode Browser version 2.14 build on top of CERN Common
Code Library 2.16re2 recognizes LOCATION but I have just made it
understand URI as well. As the HTTP client used in the Line Mode
Browser is implemented as a part of the CERN Common Code Library, the
same goes for all other clients build directly on top of the library,
e.g the NeXT Browser.

> Under what circumstances is 303 used?

This is not currently used as far as I know. The reason is that it
causes security problems having the METHOD chaning on the fly and
furthermore, I can't see the actual need for it. My advice is to forget
it!

By this I presume you mean one of two things:

a) You are writing Web pages which are targeted to a particular browser, and 
which you envisage will only be used with that browser

b) You are writing web pages, and have used Mosaic as a synonym for the Web.

If the former, you can only force people to use one browser with the CD version, 
assuming you supply the browser too. Your assumption is invalid if you make the 
Internet version available on a Web server.

If the latter, you should be aware that there are other browsers besides mosaic, 
and other software components to the Web besides browsers.

Eminently sensible. In addition, for the Internet version you would be well 
advised to use formats that can be viewed on Unix platforms too.

So, you want platform independent file formats. Those in general use that can be 
viewed on Mac, PC/WinDoze and Unix/X platforms include (common usage in 
brackets):

Still Images
------------

XBM
	two colour images (foreground / background) Can be used inline
	older PC versions of Mosaic did not handle these. Later ones do.
	Check that Macs handle these, I am told they do but have no Mac 
	to check

GIF87a	
	general 8 bit images. Can be used inline.

GIF89a	
	8 bit images with transparency. Can be used inline.

baseline TIFF v6
	24 bit images where no degredation is acceptable
	note that baseline TIFF 6 excludes LZW compression due to patent 
	scares, though it was part of the "baseline" TIFF 5 spec.

JPEG JFIF
	24 bit images where some degredation is acceptable

Movies
------

MPEG-1
	Widely available. If you require fast frame rates (ie 25/30 frames a 
	second) PC and Mac require hardware assisted decoders. Some free PC
	viewers, eg the Xing one, are broken.
Quicktime
	Payware players available on PC, free players on Mac, shareware players 	
	on Unix/X. Not all codecs can be used - check the xanim manual for 	
	details. You must flatten the movies into the data fork.

Examples of non-platform portable formats include PCX and BMP (PC/WinDoze and 
Unix/X only); PICT (Mac and Unix/X only); unflattened Quicktime movies, SGI 
movies, etc.


>1. Is it possible to author a CD with Mosaic? 

No. Mosaic is a viewer and has no editing capability.

However it is possible to create a Web on a CD, and use a web browser such as 
Mosaic to view the CD. Either directly (using file://localhost URLS) or with a 
server running on the PC with the CD drive.

You will need to have separate viewers for PCs and Macs as they are not binary 
compatible. That should not be a problem, though.

Luck with your project,

My guess is she is using WinMosaic on a machine with less than 16MB of RAM.
The pauses are common if the client (Win) machine has, say, 8MB of RAM, and
is receiving a moderately complex document of 30KB or more in length.

On my 386 notebook with 8MB, receiving the WinMosaic "What's New" page
(>100K in length), using PPP, I watch the modem lites, and see that it is
the client that is taking a LONG time to send ACKs. Like 30 sec. after
receiving 60K or so. The entire process takes 10-15 minutes! Meanwhile, the
disk is thrashing to beat hell from the pagefaulting.

Mac Mosaic and MacWeb were never like this!

Yuk! I have a really slow floating-point, so I want to decrease the
preferability settings for JPEGs (assuming servers or clients come out
to support this anytime soon. :-)  This doesn't necessarily have to be
a problem, though.

Just so I have a better idea of this, could you show me what the
default set of Accept: headers for the linemode browser would look
like?  It supports text/html and text/plain natively (big deal, don't
even need to declare that) and can handle application/octet-stream
(save it to a file.)  What else would go in there?  The ubiquitious
*/*?

Mosaic, similarly, handles few types natively; those above, plus
image/gif if it's in the context of inlined images (another domain
where the accepts should be different.)

This seems a reasonable approach in general; I just am not sure how
much it will help with this particular application.

A sound principle. The HTTP/1.0 status codes should be accessed this
way to provide multilingual support. Browser resources through URLs
would make .Xdefaults obsolete, and the size and label of the print
button should be moved from binary executables onto the net.

	I think there probably is, but imagemap is such a small
program, you might as well add in the features, and whoever wants to
use them will use them. My motto is always "keep it simple", though.

> 3)	If there is interest, how shall I post the mods?

	I would by default send any mods, bugs, and patches to Rob McCool,
since he integrated it with NCSA's server in the first place. If anyone
is willing to maintain the "official" version of NCSA's imagemap program,
you should send mail to him.

Actually this is a Solaris 2.3-sparc2 setup with Solaris's PPP and Mosaic 2.4.
The system has 32M of memory. I have 
watched the modem. There are long pauses where there isn't any 
activity on the modem.

It is interesting to note that the complexity of the html page has little
to do with it. In addition, ftp via Mosaic is very problematic. 
I tend to succeed in downloading about 60-70% of the time. However,
straight anon ftp doesn't display this problem.

I agree that they both use *should* behave the same.
In reality they don't. I can snoop the PPP line and save the
traffic, but I have no idea what to look for. Can someone
give me some hints here?

This is great!  I'm going to start working on my Littly Spunky Daemon soon,
as my work on The Hypertext Cacher and 2nd Cache Builder is almost complete. 
Using all these together should be a wonderful experience.

I forgot to mention several patches for Solaris that should be used if you 
want to run MDMA;

101318-45:	The Jumbo Kernel patch. This should be on every 2.3 box.

101316-01:	Sockets and signals patch. 

101489-04:	Threads patch.

Also, Solaris has problems accepting lots of simultaneous connections. You can
alleviate the problem somewhat by increasing the size of the maximum connection
queue by using the following command:
# ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32

When you write code that calls listen, you should always give it a big 
queue size; it'll be cut down to the value of tcp_conn_req_max. Solaris 2.4
is reputed to have a much better implementation of TCP; I'm going to be 
visiting with Sun in a few days, and I'll try and see if it makes a big 
difference.

NCSA httpd currently ships with listen's queue length  set to 5, which is a
number that works properly on just about anything but Solaris. If people
are having trouble with connection times to your solaris server, bump up
this value in the source and recompile, and you'll get much better performance.

Another problem that Solaris has is with the period of time it leaves closed
connections in the TIME_WAIT state; Solaris uses the reccommended value of 
4 minutes; this can result in thousands of tcbs hanging around tieing up memory.
Unless you're regularly serving files to sites out beyond lunar orbit, dropping
this value to about 30 seconds (as it was in 4.1.3) should be safe. 
If you do have people sending HTTP requests from that area, then somebody at 
NASA has way too much spare time on their hands.

To change this paramter to a more sensible setting, use the following command.

# ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_close_wait_interval 30000

This will also help ftp, gopher and any other one-shot protocols.

Enjoy

    Hi

    > Can somebody explain why the http2 spec says to send URI but the NCSA server
    > sends LOCATION?

    The same goes for the CERN server. I think the reason is that the
    implementation was done prior to the spec??

    > Does any client recognize the URI header in this context?

    The CERN Line Mode Browser version 2.14 build on top of CERN Common
    Code Library 2.16re2 recognizes LOCATION but I have just made it
    understand URI as well. As the HTTP client used in the Line Mode
    Browser is implemented as a part of the CERN Common Code Library, the
    same goes for all other clients build directly on top of the library,
    e.g the NeXT Browser.

Yea, the CL-HTTP server sends both URI and location.  The CL-CLIM browser
handles both as well.

    > Under what circumstances is 303 used?

    This is not currently used as far as I know. The reason is that it
    causes security problems having the METHOD chaning on the fly and
    furthermore, I can't see the actual need for it. My advice is to forget
    it!

Well, what about redirects for forms or other more complex operations on
methods other than GET?

Yes, it sounds very good for people which don't need a lot of precision
in their image mapping, which are most of the current applications.

Please send any requests and additions to NCSA, through 

httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu  

Rob is not working with NCSA this summer but if you want to reach him, you
can do so at robm@core.mcom.com

We are planning on having a new version of NCSA httpd (v1.4) by the end of 
the summer.  If you have any great ideas or suggestions, please don't
hesitate to let us know (httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu).

OK so we need a convention for overriding,

Accept: image/jpeg q=0.0

On my reading of the specs text/html and text/plain have to go in there if
there are any accept headers at all. The default applies only if you specify
no accept headers at all.

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html
>If no Accept: field is present, then it is assumed that text/plain and text/html are
>accepted. 

OK standard header is:-

GET / HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*; q=0.300
Accept: application/octet-stream; q=0.100
Accept: text/plain
Accept: text/html
User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.14  libwww/2.16pre2


This becommeth :-

GET / HTTP/1.0
Accept-URI: http://www.org/Accept/Linemode2.14
User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.14  libwww/2.16pre2


Which has in it:-

Accept: */*; q=0.300
Accept: application/octet-stream; q=0.100
Accept: text/plain
Accept: text/html



If you want to compress further you could use a header URI and put the User
Agent line there :-


GET / HTTP/1.0
Header-URI: http://www.org/Accept/Linemode2.14


I prefer Header-URI.


So for a browser running under X11R6 we might expect as a basic set of accepts:-



Accept: */*; q=0.300
Accept: application/octet-stream; q=0.100
Accept: text/plain
Accept: text/html
Accept: text/html+
Accept: text/nroff
Accept: image/jpeg
Accept: image/gif
Accept: image/xbm
Accept: image/pbmp

A single browser might have more than one config file...

Alternatively let us consider the case where a browser is really wierd but
accepts */* with low quality. It asks for a document. 95% of the time the
server only has one format to serve it in anyway. So most of the time the
accept header is ignored completely. In this case it is not a big loss
to specify a deffered header  on a non standard server and thus unlikely to
be cached.



The other obvious alternative to speed up the system would be to incorporate
some sort of negotiation protocol. This again can be leveraged. The Header-URI
could be fetched inband in the same connettion :-

GET /blah http/2.0
Header-URI  GET://linemode

	469 Not likely mate! Switch contexts
	GET //linemode

201 OK here you are..
blahh

	SWITCH
GET /blah http/2.0
Header-URI  GET://linemode

	200 Ca va?
	blahh .........
	

|>Mosaic, similarly, handles few types natively; those above, plus
|>image/gif if it's in the context of inlined images (another domain
|>where the accepts should be different.)

I think we will start to see a change in this situation. Clients will
handle most types natively. Why on earth does Mosaic not inline gif files
accesed by URL?

I've got a custom-made feedback form in which I would like to determine
automatically what page the user was on before they selected a link to take
them to the feedback form.  The description of Referer sounded like it would
do this, but apparently I misunderstand the semantics.

The spec on the CERN Web server says the Referer header is "the address of
the document from which the URI in the request was obtained."  However, it
appears that I'm getting the current URL.  Is anyone else using the Referer
header in the sense I want to use it above?

EIT is releasing, for your programming pleasure, a freeware
library of functions that aid CGI-program creation in C
(or another language that can use C libraries).  Look at

  http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/dist/doc/libcgi/libcgi.html

for documentation and pointers to the distributions, including
source.  Compiled libraries are there for SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3,
IRIX 5.2, and OSF/1 V2.0.

These are functions we found useful, especially for programs that
process forms.  The get_form_entries function, for example, handles
parameter names and values of arbitrary length with exponential
allocation.  It is also more efficient than a lot of the other parsing
code we've seen.

I've attached a template program that uses libcgi so you can
see basically what it does for you.

Isn't it time we started calling them "CGI programs" instead of
"CGI scripts"? ;-)

ABSOLUTELY! This was an issue when I wrote the Windows httpd documentation. Furthermore, 
we aren't writing "gateways" all the time either, so it should be Common ???? Interface. 
The HTTP protocol, including the "extra header" capability, can be used for virtually 
limitless applications, not just serving HTML documents and related services.

The current version (1.3Pre) of Windows HTTPD has a file handle leak when accessed via a 
proxy cache and the requested document has not changed per the "If-modified-since". Each 
time the server replies with "use your local coipy" it eats a file handle. After 16 of 
these, the server becomes inoperable. 

This will be fixed in the next release.

Perhaps the protocol should only allow URNs that reference immutable
data, so that you wouldn't have to validate your cache for your accept
group?

Allow? No!

Encourage - yes!


I think that we should never be dogmatic. In some unusual circumstances it
might be usefull to vary things. I don't think we should be dogmatic.

This is why I disagree with Tim over the news: url. I think it should be
permissable to incorporate the server into the URL. news://dxcern/. Not
because thats a good thing to do in general but 0.1% of the time it might
be very useful indeed.

It's not HyperMail, but there's my HyperMail-like archive.  The home page is:

http://asearch.mccmedia.com/

The top-level menu for www-talk is:

I've recently added an index sorted by the number of replies (in addition
to subject and date) and full-text search of my entire archive, which

If the URNs you send in the protocol are allowed to refer to mutable
data, the server can't easily maintain a valid cache. Isn't it better
to have a kind of URN that references data that cannot change out from
under it (e.g., a MD5 hash signature of the headers?)

In general, using hash signatures for data allows lower bandwidth and
processing time, e.g., you could send some combination of
  accept headers
  credentials

and other elements, hashed with the key of the client; the server, if
it hasn't either recently authenticated the client or parsed the
accept headers could return back to the client a request for more
details, which the client would resend.

The server could then keep this and hash it and use it in subsequent
retrievals. 

This would allow a relatively low bandwidth transaction for most
subsequent events, and yet avoid requiring the maintenance of state
for arbitrary amounts of time.

Version 0.12 of libwww-perl is now available.

libwww-perl is a library of Perl4 packages which provides a simple
and consistent programming interface to the World-Wide Web.  This
library is being developed as a collaborative effort to assist the
further development of useful WWW clients and tools.

The distribution site and much more information about the libraries
can be found at 

       <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/>

and also at

       <ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/libwww-perl/>


I am looking for more contributions to support the many protocols
and also to provide better HTML libraries.

A mailing list has been established for technical discussion about
libwww-perl, including problem reports, interim fixes, suggestions
for features, and contributions. The mailing list address is 

       libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu

and administrivia (including subscribe requests) should be sent to 

       libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu


Changes from version 0.11:

   Placed everything under RCS version control and included repository.
   Added www'stat (from Brooks Cutter) for doing stat-like calls on a URL.
   Added message field to wwwerror'onrequest so that error-specific
   messages (e.g. $@ and $!) can be included in the canned HTML output.
   Added symbolic names for all response code numbers.
   Reassigned 000 Timed Out error to response code 603.
   Added 602 Connection Failed response code.
   Vastly improved the error-handling for wwwhttp'request().
   Now escapes the URL entries generated by wwwfile'dirlist().
   Removed buggy attempt to delete comments at start of wwwhtml'extract_links.
   Updated META parsing in wwwhtml to reflect HTML 2.0 proposed spec.
   Moved require of sys/socket.ph outside of wwwhttp package declaration
   due to a bug in perl4 found by Martijn Koster.
   Added many checks to be sure environment variables are defined before
   trying to use them in wwwmime, wwwurl, get, and testdates (Martijn Koster).
   Fixed bug that occurred when parsing URLs with an empty path.
   Replaced complicated wwwurl'unescape loop with a simple substitute
   (from Steven E. Brenner via Brooks Cutter).
   Added wwwurl'escape() to %hex escape URL segments (from Brooks Cutter).
   Added testescapes program for testing wwwurl'escape and unescape.

I don't see many style questions come across this list, but what the heck.
Maybe someone will have good advice...

I have a document covering technical material.  The outline is rather deeply
nested (up to four levels.)  In a paper document I'd have no problems.  The
document would appear as:

<h1>Chapter</h1>
<h2>Section</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
<h4>Clarification</h4>

I want to hyperlink to sections (possibly subsections too) instead of
creating giant chapter files.  This would appear as:

<h1>Chapter</h1>
<a href="section-number"><h2>Section</h2></a>

It reads a lot like an annotated table of contents.

The question I have lies in the structuring of the section documents.  Do
those documents have initial headings at level <h1> or <h3>?  I'm planning
on repeating the <h2> heading that links to the section document.  Should
this be the <title> or the first heading?  Both?

I want to provide consistent visual clues as to document structure, but I
don't want to duplicate lot's of text.  The more duplicated text there is
the harder it will be for me to maintain.  I'm asking my target audience
these same questions but they don't have enough experience with hypertext to
have a preference.  (Yet...)

Thanks in advance,

- Ken

I'm trying to get a pointer into the archives.

I was wondering whether there has been any discussion in the past
regarding the lifetime of a document, somewhat akin to the lifetime of
DNS records.

I thought that this kind of information might be useful to a proxy or
cache.  Script generated documents could be given a lifetime of zero
(or in the case of stock price charts, for example, the time until the
next time the chart would be updated) while rather stable things (like
a Shakespeare play, could be given a rather long lifetime.)

Anyway, could anyone give me a pointer to the prior discussion (if
any)?

		Thanks in advance.

Well, few problems ;-)

As you say "would appear" I presume you are still talking about the paper 
document at this point.

I don't see how this is "instead of". You can link to sections, subsections, or 
clarifications if you want to, or not. You can have giant files, or split them 
up into smaller ones. While these are clearly interrelated issues in document 
design, one is not consequent on another.

> This would appear as:

> <a href="section-number"><h2>Section</h2></a>

> It reads a lot like an annotated table of contents

OK so you have each chapter file that says

<h1>Parallel computers</h1>
<a href="mps"><h2>Message passing systems</h2></a>
<a href="vsm"><h2>Virtual shared memory systems</h2></a>
and so on...

> The question I have lies in the structuring of the section documents.  Do

There are two issues here - you want to repeat the section headings, and you 
want to make them h2 like they were in the chapter files. Again, one decision is 
not consequent on another.

Some options you have for the section files:

1) use h1 for the previous chapter head and h2 for the section heads

<h1>Parallel computers</h1>
<h2>Message passing systems</h2>
<p>Blah blah</p>

That certainly draws attention to the chapter title, to my mind more so than is 
warranted. In the section files, it is the section title that is the important 
thing - the chapter title is a navigational aid.

2) use h1 for the section titles, and a paragraph for the chapter titles

<p>[Up to <a href="blah">Parallel computers</a>]</p>
<hr>
<h1>Message passing systems</h1>
<p>blah blah</p>

This lets you use h2 for subsections and h3 for clarification, assuming these 
are all in the one file. If you put sections in separate files, you could have

<p>[Top: <a href="blah"><b>Parallel computers</b></a>]<br>
   [Up to <a href="blah2">Virtual shared memory systems</a>]</p>
<hr>
<h1>The KSR-1 system</h1>

<h2>Cache coherency issues</h2>

for example, using h1 again for the title of that page (in this case a

3) Use h1 for chapters, h2 for sections, h3 for subsections etc as if it were 
all one monolithic document, but cut into pieces.

Especially if you split up into subsection files, this could look a bit odd; the 
page starting up with an h3.

Where titles are concerned, their main use seems to be as strings of keywords 
which indexing programs can chew on. So put into your title whatever you want to 
get hits on.

One idea is to cat the headers together, thus:

<title>Parallel computers</title>

<title>Parallel computers - Virtual shared memory systems</title>

<title>Parallel computers - Virtual shared memory systems - the KSR</title>

for chapter, section and subsection files respectively.

You are. You're going to do it manually, aren't you. No no no no

Use a conversion program. Please.

Yes, you are correct.  Certainly there can be inter and intra document
references.  Hmm... another style question:  Do people prefer one giant
document with internal references, or many small documents with external
references?

There are a lot of different ways of doing it.  I was kind of wondering what
a nice consistent reader-friendly way of doing it is...  How do you
structure your document headers?  LaTeX to HTML preserves the relative
section sizes between chapters and sections.  I've seen lot's of other
documents that don't, i.e. all documents start at <h1> regardless of whether
they are nested within a larger construct.

What does manually mean?  Do you mean that I am going to think of it using
my head?  Then yes.  Type it by hand?  Then yes.  Make corrections by hand?
Then yes.  Have my readers review it with their eyes?  Then yes.  (I do use
ispell though... ;-)

I don't know what manually means to you.

> Use a conversion program. Please.

There's nothing to convert because the document doesn't exist.

OH!  You mean "don't use HTML to write your document because it's not
expressive enough."  I thought that this might be a problem.  I've finally
decided that a consistent style and the lemacs HTML mode might be sufficient.
HTML+ should improve things.

Don't get me wrong, I like to automate things.  TeX does a very nice job of
automatically breaking lines and formatting text.  A C++ compiler sometimes
does a very nice job of generating machine code.  Lisp usually does a good
job at memory management.  Certainly there exist tools to assist in
generating style-guide conforming documents --- but there needs to be a
style first, right?

You seem assume that given structure, you can emit style.  While I feel that
this has truth in it, I'm not convinced.  LaTeX to HTML is one of the better
translators I've used --- but it is very difficult to get a reasonable style
out of it.  Consistent, yes.  Blindly mechanical, yes.  Good style, only
sometimes.

Maybe we should split this discussion into:  (a) how do you use header
nesting? and (b) do you think HTML is expressive enough to write in?

Could we all get a run down of what you think the best "conversion programs"
are?  On the three major OS's (Unix, Mac, DOS).

I have a feeling that many of us are still creating and maintaining HTML
documents manually.  In my view, the reason for this is that:

1) There is not a basic "Do this and Don't do That" document regarding HTML
creation.  The intro to HTML doc's I've come across discuss the minimal HTML
coding needed.  However, they do not go into details about what to do and
not to do to make the documents as complient as possible with regard to
future generations of HTML.

2) Conversion programs are not adequately emphasized or publicised.  If we
all want to integrate more capabilities into HTML at the expense of
simplicity, then we need to work on creating software which makes it easy
for laymen(women) to create/convert "correct" HTML documents without to much
hassle.  

Basic HTML is easy to learn and use. This is one of the reasons the WWW has
taken off the way it has. When you get into issues regarding <HEAD>
contents, things get murky and inadequately documented (IMHO).  Many HTML
writers avoid these complexities because they do not effect the appearence
of the HTML with today's browsers.  If we decide to evolve to stricter, more
powerful, SGML complient HTML, then we have to think about the the average
user out there.  We need to avoid making all the HTML doc's which currently
exist obsolete due to stricter requirements (unless an easy to use update
program exists), when much of the HTML authors were unaware they had to
comply to certain standards in the first place.  

Perhaps one of you guru's could come up with a layman's interpretation of
the latest HTML spec, come up with some guidlines for HTML writers to comply
to the current and future standards, and emphasize which "conversion
programs" to use and how to use them effectively.  Then we should distribute
this document with all Web browsers and servers (or provide links to it in
all browsers and servers).

Am I wrong in making these assumptions?  If so, where and what
documents/programs am I not aware of?

This really depends on who the audience is, what type of client-side
stuff they have... For example, if you are only publishing internal to
your company, have a good network, and the users have browsers that
can efficiently manage one large chapter file, you should do it.

However, if your audience has a slow network or a less than robust
browser, break it into smaller chunks. People aren't going to 
read something if it is time consuming and annoying to get the
data in the first place.

I think that people are asking if the document already exists in 
a standard DTP format, and if you mean to use a filter to convert
from the DTP format to HTML. 

> Maybe we should split this discussion into:  (a) how do you use header

As for me, I am looking at 30 page chapters with 3 levels of
headings in the chapters for my work. I work in Frame and most of my formatting
is directly convertable to HTML directives. I will probably break
things up at the section headings instead of the chapter level.
I really think that 30 pages is too much for one document, but
5-8 pages is ok.

I will also offer a Table of Contents for all levels of headings
so that people can go to what they want, and I will use wais as
an index.

I really think that once the <smirk>, <flame> and <smile> tags are
implemented we should have a good basis for expressive written languague.
Until then, it will only be the printed word.

This looks like it should be something that a browser should send to an HTTP
server --- similar to the accept stuff.  Is there any way of deciding what
to send a browser on the basis of the browser's and/or network's performance?
It would be nice if some performance metrics could be agreed upon --- things
like Kilobytes per second transfer, or Kilobytes per currency-unit transfer,
or Kilobytes per how-fast-I-read, etc.

This is related to some interesting discussion that started concerning the
association of accept types with browser types.  Is it sufficient to always
talk about capability, and not about preference, performance or cost?

*The* standard in this case is SGML. In all versions of the HTML DTD
that I have seen, PRE has so-called `mixed content', that means that
tags must be recognized as tags, which in turn means that `<' is a
special delimiter. The answer therefore must be: use &lt;. (Btw. `>'
is not special.)


To widen the discussion a bit: I know this definition of PRE is
current practice, but can't we change it? I've always wondered why
PRE wasn't defined as

	<!element pre - - cdata>

that way you could _really_ enclose any piece of program code in PRE
tags, without having to remove `<' and `&'.

In HTML 3.0 at least, we don't need PRE (as it is currently defined)
anymore. Consider:

	<pre>
	a line in a fixed width font
	    an <b>indented</b> line in a fixed width font
	       another <b>indented</b> line in a fixed width font
	</pre>

But if people are going to add <B> and <HR> to their `verbatim' code,
why not also add <BR> and <TAB>?

	<p>
	<tt><hide>xxxx<tab id=t1>xxxx<tab id=t2></hide>
	a line in a fixed width font<br>
	  <tab to=t1>an <b>indented</b> line in a fixed width font<br>
	    <tab to=t2>another <b>indented</b> line in a fixed width font
	</tt>

The latter. You might not want to read all of it, so you only pay the 
network lag for the bits you want to read.

That was the purpose of the comments that you have edited out. In case it 
was not apparent, the second way was the one I was suggesting as being the 
most consistent and user freindly.

>> You are. You're going to do it manually, aren't you. No no no no

> What does manually mean? [sarcasm deleted]

Manually means applying basic software engineering principles - avoid the 
cut and paste school of programming. If, conceptually in the monolithic 
document, you have a chapter title "Mating behaviour in ducks and geese" you 
only have that _once_ in the revisable form of the document. 

Doing it manually means that you type that string into each and every 
document that uses it as an anchor. It means that when you later change it 
to "Mating behahaviour in ducks" you have to manually go through and edit 
each instance of the chapter title. It means that you inadvertantly miss one 
out, and that one subsection in the ducks chapter still refers to geese ...

Doing it automatically means that you prepare the document in one form then 
apply rules - with a makefile, using cpp, awk, whatever - to generate the 
final form. It means that the resulting document is maintainable, accurate, 
and easy to read. Given that your .sig talks about CAD/CAM/CAE process 
integration I expected you to be very familiar with these concepts.

> There's nothing to convert because the document doesn't exist.

So write it, then... puzzled.

> OH!  You mean "don't use HTML to write your document because it's not
> expressive enough." 

No, actually, although that is certainly an option.

> You seem assume that given structure, you can emit style

Given structure you can emit documents conforming to the layout rules you 
have chosen. Whether that is a suitable choice for a particular document is 
of course up to you.

No. That is an HTML editor. I was talking about programs to take care of

I heard that too. It does nothing that a good (free) emacs mode like 
sgml-mode or psgml can't do. It doesn't let you put in characters like 
a-umlaut and so on. I have hearsd of some other shortcomings, too. Plus of 
course it is a cut down copy of the commercial version, which is itself a 
sawn-off version of their expensive Author/Editor SGML package which is 
corporately priced ;-)

Doesn't this depend, at least to some extent, on the documents themselves. 
Project gutenberg provide *large* texts and, to judge from some of the
replies to this list, there is demand for them.  I, for example, am using
our hcsa httpd to serve master documents (still under development) from a
backend mixed relational/full text database.  Some of these are large and
some are small.  None of them exist in the form they are actually viewed.
The network lag is a problem but still, the size of a document is a feature
of a document not a browser or a network.  If we defer to browsers and
networks here then the larger project - the free distribution of
information and knowledge (same thing? - no) around the world.

Well, I have "p" for programmer in my account name ...

Still, the central point is absolutely correct.  Manual maintenance of
large document stores is bound to result in errors and inaccuracies.  This
is what computers are *for*.  They do billions of almost meaningless, dull,
repetative tasks in the blink of an eye (well the odd Cray might ...;). 
Maintaining an up to date set of links in a datastore is a *doddle* for
them.  Use the tool that fits the job.

The easiest way to tell folks a simple algorithm for representing
an arbitrary string in PCDATA is to say
	"replace all &, <, and > with entity references or
	numeric character entities."

Note that the spec says that this is sufficient -- it doesn't say
it's necessary.

There's no way to represent the string </x inside CDATA. None. So
if your program includes that string (or ]]>) you're out of luck.

Also, pre was born because folks wanted anchors inside their
preformatted text.

Yes, the characters "</" followed by a letter may not occur in an
element declared as CDATA, but how often will that happen? All
programming languages I know, except for SGML, use "<" and "&", but
none uses "</". (Btw. The string "]]>" is OK here.)

Aside:

The string "</" would not be special (but "]]>" would) in an
`unparsable marked section', another obscure SGML feature: you can
actually include CDATA anywhere, by enclosing it in <![ CDATA [...]]>,
like this:

   <P>This is a normal paragraph, but it has some strange characters
   in it and I'm too lazy to replace them with entities... <![ CDATA [
   < > </ & <! <!-- ]]>

It only has to happen once in the whole World-Wide Web, and
my point is made. Here's a C program that you can't put in 
a cdata element:

	main()
	{	
		printf("example SGML: <xyz>...</xyz>\n");
	}

This is the preferred method for using CDATA. See

for several articles by Erik Naggum on the evils of CDATA declared

Now we just have to get marked section parsing in libWWW...

     Hello,
     
     Wondering if some one could share their experience in setting WWW 
     server to be used for line mode browsers particularly the 
     configuration and user interface issues.  I currently have a WWW 
     server which is full graphics and some people in our European 
     subsidiaries have concerns in accessing the documents over the phone 
     lines due to speed limitations.  What is the best way to set up the 
     WWW server so that line mode browsers could be used.
     
     Thank you for your time.

Re:	HTML Specification: Interpretation of Ampersands


I am writing an interpreter for HTML using Visual Basic and the ALLText custom
control for display of multi-font text and hypertext handling.  

I am somewhat confused by the use of the ampersand character ("&").  As far as I
read the specification, the ampersand is to be used ONLY as a special escape
character.  In order to embed an ampersand in the text presented by a viewer one
should use the string "&amp".  My confusion arises from the fact that I have a
copy of MOSAIC which appears to handle the ampersand in some cases as a standard
character.  For instance, in the following line of a HTML document:

    <li><a href="uh00coay.htm"><h2>P&G did something weird </h2></a>

Is there some special case in force here?  How should a string like this be
handled?

What should the rule for interpretation be where the ampersand is not followed
by either a character reference or one of the special entities specified in the
DTD?

	Thanks in advance for any responses.

In such cases where the '&' doesn't map to a DTD entity, then the parser 
usually just goes ahead and displays the '&' and the text following.

Not to say that this is correct.

In Lynx, but not some Mosaics, take for example the following which is not
correctly parsed: 

	<a href=someURL>Some Text &</a>

will display

	Some Text &</a>


It will work with a space in between the '&' and '</a>'.

Help - I need pointers regarding web server and web viewer efficiency
vis-a-vis other internet capabilities such as FTP and Telnet.

Any pointers appreciated.

M. Hart in the recent past raised some issues concerning efficiency of
the web. Thinking I wouldn't need the ensuing discussion I read it but
did not save it. Now I find I need it. Did anyone save it? I tried the
list-server archive but did not seem to find anything that would help.
Is there a paper that discusses the effiecency of the web and the 
X windows perfornance of viewers? I think that bringing up X windows isn't
relevent, but people attach more importance to what they understand a 
little of than to items they have no knowledge of. Any pointers would
be appreciated. People are moving to make the web (one of the) standard
here, but with objections it has less chance of success.

I have found it best to always use the complete specification
of an SGML general entity reference, including the "reference end",
like this:

     &amp;
         ^--note the terminating semi-colon.

This avoids any ambiguity the parser cannot resolve.

I have noted that some programs to convert some markup
to HTML neglect to add the reference end, which means some clean
up in the converted file.

Browsers aren't very good at working with compound documents --- that is, a
related web of documents.  Things like searching, printing, saving, etc.
don't work very well.  Mosaic doesn't even save inlined images when
documents are saved as hypertext!  Clearly it is possible to implement these:
fish search for Mosaic is a good example.  Browsers need to improve to the
point where a reader is unaware they've crossed a "document" boundary.
Well, it should be smoother at least...

Several people have pointed this out to me.  :-)

[censorship flame:  I don't think we need automated censorship of articles
yet.  Because my previous paragraph contained "Mosaic" it would have been
tossed back to me.  Maybe not a big deal now, but once the infrastructure is
in place I can see it being abused.]

I assume that you define "section" to be "one of the units of information
that the current topic is decomposed into."  Then you suggest that header
levels reflect the physical nesting of sections within the same document,
right?  (Take document to mean "the contiguous unit of hypertext that gets
loaded into a browser.")  You also seem to recomend that header levels
should be "reset" to <h1> with every new document.

I think this is style that looks best --- I format my documents like this.

Does this have any impact on automatic table of contents generators?
Re-using the <h1> level for chapters and sections is probably okay.  It
might get confusing if logical sub-sections are ever tagged <h1>.

Chris and I differ greatly on the use of navigational components in the text.
Things like "on to", "up to", "next", "previous", etc.  I personally don't
like these mechanisms because the traversal history stored in the reader's
browser often doesn't match what the author intended.  This means that the
reader has to (a) ignore any browser navigation, or (b) maintain the
relationship between browser history and document structure in her head.  I
think HTML+ will help solve this by providing the hints browser needs to
maintain that structure mapping automatically.  I've done a simple hack to
Mosaic to associate the functions on window buttons with hyperlinks in the
text:

	<a href="!backnode">Go back</a>

This would perform the Mosaic previous-page function.  It worked out okay,
but wasn't complete enough to be useful.  Browsers need to understand a *lot*
more about document structure...

How do others feel about navigational aids?

I completely agree with you.  Once I get "The Style" then I can provide the
tools that implement an appropriate level of automation.  Right now, this
appropriate level is just emacs macros (which can be pretty damned
sophisticated!)

I want to stay in HTML.  Ideally, I'd like to stay within pure HTML.  That's
not realistically possible, so dropping back to some higher level markup
(maybe with a macro language) doesn't bother me too much.  What you seem to
be suggesting is create my document in something completely different and
then do the translation to HTML mechanically.  This is what I meant by:

> > OH!  You mean "don't use HTML to write your document because it's not

We often argue ourselves into agreement... Is this one of those cases?  ;-)

I've just about finished reading a book on technical editing.  It's been a
real eye-opener for me --- I thought that the editor's job was mostly
mechanical.  A lot of style decisions *are* mechanical, but there needs to
be simple and effective ways to "change the rules."

Hi - Mind if I call you $LOG? :-)

I've got it all tucked away in my personal archive, which I'll forward on
if you can't find the articles in the Hypermail archive (it's off the
WWW home page at CERN.

I'm also planning to set up a mailing list dealing with WWW efficiency and 
scaling issues. This will be a technical list for server and client implemntors-
send mail to ses=www-speed@tipper.oit.unc.edu if you'ld like to 
subscribe.

I wasn't really serious. I was just thinking about ways to
get folks to do a little reading before they post to www-talk.

[The pointers to NCSA's documentation were real, and I
really would like folks to use them, though.]

I figured if everybody on the list knew not to use the M word,
we could use it as a little device to detect newcomers.

Just let's hope I never become a mailing list admistrator.

I'd hate to have all my sins revisited on me. :-)

I'm trying to write a script that will search for information, and then
return a a specific HTML page on my server. It seems that sending back a
header along the lines of:

HTTP/1.0 302 Found
URI: /thefilename.html

should work, but the two browsers that I've tried (MacMosaic and MacWeb)
both seem not to support the 302 response. Is 302 a response that many
browsers understand? I would find it very useful for returns from searches,
that don't exactly fall in the semantics of 301.

Thanks a lot!

Subject: GNA Library Meeting Announcement
Date: Tue, 12 Jul 94 20:57:06 EDT
From: Joseph Wang <joe@MIT.EDU>
content-length: 3065


To the GNA Mail handlers:

Sorry to do this to you, but could you create an automated mailing
list gna-library (should be archived but not HTML'ized)?  I know that
we are running short on room to run automated GNA mailing lists, but
the library is a basic GNA service, and do think that the list will
have enough traffic to justify the list.

To everyone else:

Just a reminder that there will be a Globewide Network Academy Library
meeting tomorrow at 1800 GMT (1400 EDT).  The topic for immediate
discussion will be revamping the meta-library and the consultant's
list under the aegis of the GNA Library system.  We may also get 
into general discussion about the GNA Library Strategic Plan that 
djkahle@mit.edu posted earlier.

To attend as a guest:

telnet erau.db.erau.edu 8888
connect guest
@go #2896

Brief overview of topics to be discussed.....

The GNA meta-library and consultant's lists are useful prototypes
which suffer from some serious problems.  They are run using a
postgres database which is prone to breakdown.  More seriously, the
indexing system that they are using are labor intensive to catalog and
hence the entire index is seriously out of date.

The consultant's list suffer from a lack of use.  Most likely this is
due to a difficulty in use and a psychological block in e-mailing a
question to a stranger's personal e-mail address.  Also, the nature of
the interaction seems to work against the "sense of community" which
is necessary for an educational initiative to work.  Also, the
consultant's list duplicates the GNA Reference Librarian system and
the two should be combined.

Finally, we will need to discuss how the meta-library and consultant's
list fits into the GNA library's long term strategic plans.  Within a
year, GNA should be in a position to apply for grant monies and
possibly hiring a staff of librarians.  We will need to discuss how to
fold the meta-library and consultant's list projects into these long
term goals.

As I see it there is a definite need for an Internet Library.  There
are a lot of collections of materials on the internet.  There are even
some sorted collections of materials on the internet.  But thus far,
there is nothing on the net comparable to a typical university
research library.  There aren't any places which are run by a
professional library staff where LC call numbers are assigned and
holdings are classified and sorted in a way that makes materials
accessible to researchers and browsers.

I think much of the reason for this is in order to make something like
that work, you need a partnership between professional librarians,
computer hackers, and funders and thus far this partnership hasn't
occurred on the internet.  Thus far, internet catalog systems have
been designed by computer hackers, and the internet has grown to the
point where those systems are getting overwhelmed.  Meanwhile, the
internet complexity has grown to the point that some paid staff is
necessary to make it all work.

Trying to sort all of this out will be the purpose of the meeting 
tomorrow.

I've been reading the http protocol specification and
came across the request function  pragma no-cache.

I'm glad to see that there is a way for a client to express
its need for the latest-and-greatest version of the referenced
document, or to force any caches to be cleared.

But a simple change could add a lot of power.

Many clients might need not have the absolute latest version
of a document, but might be happy with one that is X time-units old.

For example, the client might want to say, in effect, "give me the
document referenced by this URL.  I am willing to accept a copy that
might be 2 hours old."

(When I say "might be X hours old", I'm referring not to the age of
the document since it last changed, but the time since it may have
been copied from the authoritative server.)

So... It would be useful to have the (optional) ability to give a
number with the "no-cache" pragma to express a time (or date?).  If a
cache has a copy which is younger than the specified time, that copy
may be delivered in the response.  Otherwise the cache should treat
the pragma exactly as "no-cache" is presently defined.

Have any browsers already implemented this?

  Good question.  I just detect how long the mouse has been down, before
turning it from a click into a mouse-drag sort of submit.  Semi-easy.

>For 2 and 3,
>Have any browsers already implemented this?

   The Emacs-w3 browser has support for this, but it is broken right now
because of a limitation of lucid emacs.  It sends the results (x,y) in
relation to the entire emacs frame, not the actual image.  Next version of
Xemacs will hopefully have this feature built in.  But the groundwork is
there, so it will take about 3 minutes to add 'real' support once emacs
supports the necessary primitives.

   I imagine that Pei Wei could add this to Viola-WWW pretty quickly if
he hasn't already.  Working in an interpreted language is so much 
nicer/faster for prototyping things like this.

>Sorry if this has been asked before.

   Don't think it has - good point though.  Perhaps we need another
tag?  ISDRAG to complement ISMAP?

This is arguable.

Searching works fine, for example using web traversing robots. Obviously search 
'in file' won't work if you split it up into several files - if search is 
important, making each html file a searchable index with the search engine 
looking over the whole document.

Printing a tree structured document is clearly a problem, but not 
insurmountable. Browsers would need to be a bit more clever in retrieving 
referenced files and linearising a tree for printing. Saving a file works. If 
you want to save a reference to the top of a document tree, save the top node.

Of course, saving local copies of documents goes against the Web philosophy. How 
do you know that your copy matches the original? If you want to save a document 
for future reference, save the URL. If network latency or bandwidth is a 
problem, use a proxy.

>Mosaic doesn't even save inlined images when
>documents are saved as hypertext!

Sigh. Mosaic questions to ... of course it saves the HTML,  so all links - 
whether to images or other html files or whatever - are not retrieved and saved. 
However, Mosaic 2.4 for X does not insert BASE tags so relative links often fail 
with saved documents. This is however a minor implementation detail of one 
browser; your original questions seemed to be referring to the authoring process 
rather than the precise interactions with a particular browser.

> Browsers need to improve to the
> point where a reader is unaware they've crossed a "document" boundary.
> Well, it should be smoother at least...

Agree. However these improvements are all do-able with the current 
specification. There is nothing to prevent a printing function, for example, 
optionally getting linked documents by some search strategy - only one hop, on 
the same server as the base document, for example - and composing these into a 
single printable file.

> I assume that you define "section" to be "one of the units of information
> that the current topic is decomposed into."

No.

I was using the word "section" in precisely the way you had used it in your 
original message, which divided the levels of a conceptual document into 
Chapter, section, subsection and clarification if memory serves. Your choice of 
terms, not mine. Given that, perhaps you should read my original reply again.

Yes.

Actually I was taking "document" to mean a conceptual monolithic document with 
the four levels of heading that you originally specified. Whether this is 
delivered as one html file or several is a matter of implementation. I have used 
"file" or "html file" as meaning "the contiguous unit of hypertext that gets
loaded into a browser."

Yes, otherwise the headings get lost in deeply nested documents. Also, it means 
that each delivered html file has an H1 as its first header, ie each file is 
valid HTML. If you deliver a document that starts h3, it is not valid (but it 
will have lots of company ;-) )

This is also the style that Webmaker tends to produce. I like it, too.

Not if you generate the TOC from the original, conceptual monolithic document.

Um. I know what you mean, and agree to some extent. I hate seeing a link that 
says back to blah - or, worse, back - because I may not have come by that route. 
On the other hand, being able to navigate through a tree structured document 
using such buttons is handy. That is why, if you look at my original examples, 
my buttons did *not* say back, next, etc.

They said "Up to {chapter title}", and so on. In other words, they clearly said 
that they were related to the logical structure of a document, as opposed to the 
traversal history taken by a particular viewer. To my mind, provided these 
concepts are kept separate, there is no problem.

Actually, my reading of Dave Raggetts paper at WWW94 lead me to believe that 
GTML+ tries to blur the distinction between logical document structural 
nvigation and browsing history navigation. I would rather keep these concepts 
clearly separate.

I'd appreciate any Lynx specific questions taken to 
lynx-dev@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu, but that is a matter of taste.

Anyhow, Lynx 2.3 defaults to text/plain, unless a content type is given 
by the server.

I've modified the next version to default to text/html to ease these 
types of problems when doing an HTTP request.

	Not sure if this was best.   One annoying feature of Mosaic 
is that it presumes things are HTML unless otherwise explicitly labeled. 
Retrieve any number of plain-text items that aren't clearly labeled, 
and blech!   Runtogethernonsense.   Maybe there should be some fall-back 
processing when there's no content-type record.   It shouldn't be a really

Ah. I think perhaps you misunderstand.

When using a cacheing proxy server, you *do* always get the latest and greatest 
version - unless the original server is unreachable, in which case you get what 
was in the cache.

When the proxy gets a request, it sends a HEAD request to the original server to 
check that the cached file has not expired and has not changed. If all is OK, 
the cached copy is sent to the client.

As I understand it, pragma no-cache is more a security consideration to prevent 
documents which need authentication piling up in intermediate proxy caches. If 
I'm wrong her, perhaps Phil HB will put me straight).

> For example, the client might want to say, in effect, "give me the
> document referenced by this URL.  I am willing to accept a copy that
> might be 2 hours old."

My comments above notwithstanding, this may be useful (but not in the context of 
pragma nocache). BUT, how would you specify this at the user interface level? It 
will change from document to document, so would have to be set by the user. For 
example, a copy of Shakespears sonnets that is 1 year old is likely to be fine, 
wheras a video grab of a coffe pot that is 5 minutes old might be worthless ;-)

Being prompted for the acceptable age with *each* GET would be tiresome. It 
would also only matter if you were using a proxy, not if you were talking to the 
originbal server. As the whole point is to make proxy cacheing transparent to 
the user - nop URLs to edit, it all works as before but faster - on balance I do 
not see the merit of your proposal. It would save network time at the expense of 
user time, which is the wrong way round in my book.

> (When I say "might be X hours old", I'm referring not to the age of

> been copied from the authoritative server.)

I see why you say this, but there is no need, as described above. The age of the 
document since it last changed is readily available information.

Since content-type: is optional on the return value from a HTTP GET,
the spec should say what the default is. I propose that the spec say
that the default is text/html. (The spec currently doesn't say, as far
as I can tell). This corresponds closely to the original spirit of
HTTP 0.9 (where everything was text/html), is the presumption of
Mosaic, and could easily be of Lynx, and it's better to have a
default.

HTTP servers probably should try to include a content-type: text/html
anyway, if that's what they mean.

I'm pretty sure that text/html is the default in one direction (if no header
is included, then text/html is assumed). MDMA automagically adds 
a Content-Type: text/html if no other typing information is available, 
and I think other servers do the same thing. 

Sometimes this is the wrong thing to do, but at least its consistent. The only
other sensible alternative is to require all html files to have entries in 
in the type-mapping tables, and use text/plain as the default. Since that
alternative breaks some of our document sets, I decided not to take that 
approach.

(Rick, I think I just sent you a bogus message, sorry).

I agree.  I actually do not like Mosaic's behavior of assuming text/html
unless told otherwise.  This gives lovely behavior when trying to access
something like a file compressed with gzip.  XMosaic stuffs a bunch of
gibberish onto the screen.

I think this has been discussed before.  Didn't it go like this? :

        1.  Obey the HTTP 1.0 content type
        2.  Otherwise, check the suffix on the file and guess
        3.  Otherwise, call HTSaveLocally (or equiv) to just put the
                file on local disk.

I prefer that the default be text/plain.  This is the default for
MIME, but more importantly, I much prefer seeing the occasional HTML
source interpreted as plain text (when text/html was omitted) than
seeing a non-HTML text file mangled by a "forgiving" HTML parser.  I
don't buy the argument about compatibility with HTTP 0.9 (there HTML
was the only reasonable choice) nor with Mosaic (it's still called
"World-Wide Web", not "Mosaic" :-).

Exactly.

The protocol doesn't need to specify what the server chooses if it
doesn't recognize the extension.  Your choice is right for your
system.  I made our server default to text/plain.  No big deal.

The protocol should specify what the client must assume if there is no
Content-type.  Here I think text/plain is more appropriate (see my
previous message).

I've just fired up LANWatch and watched what happened.  I'm running the Cern pre-3
httpd with caching.  I just fetched some stuff from the cache.  No packets went

I'm not sure how to best present it to a user.  However, I sure
imaginative GUI designers can do it.  My own personal experience is
illustrative.  I've been (slowly) reading the WWW documents and I tend
to flip back/forth over a period of days, so I don't keep a copy of my
reader running continuously.  I have been greatly helped by the
reduction in access delay due to the cache, and because I'm learning
rather than researching, I don't care if I have the absolutely latest
draft document.  However, on the other hand, I do look at some
government reports that are revised daily.  It is very important to me that
I can skip the version that is in my cache.

Stock reports are a good example.  During the day I want really fresh
copies, but at night, when the market is closed, I'm happy to live
with the snapshot taken when the marked closed.

A reasonable defaulting scheme can be set up.  To me how it is presented to
the user is a GUI issue.

And I'm not sure that all the consumers of WWW data need GUIs...
robots will want to gather stuff and depending on their jobs they may
require up-to-date or can merely get by with aged documents.

To use the technique that I think you are suggesting, the viewer would have to
send a HEAD request to get the document change date.  Then the viewer would have
to look at the response and:

	if (response_is_from_an_uncached_server() == TRUE)
	        {
	        get_the_document();
	        }
           else { /* Response is from a cache */
	        if (is_response_new_enough() == TRUE)
		        {
		        get_the_document();
                        }
		   else get_the_document_but_say_pragma_no_cache();
		}
	 	
The question is what is the semantics of is_response_new_enough().  If
you are to look only at the origination date/time of the document as
it exists in the cache, you don't have enough information to know
whether there might exist a newer revision that has occured since the
cache snapshot was made.  If you know how long it has been since the
snapshot was made, then you can at least give the user a chance to
decide whether he/she/it ought to take the risk that the document in
the cache is new enough according to their own criteria.

What is suggesting itself to me as I type is an alternative mechanism.

I've seen a propsed header line that says that a document has been delivered
by a caching server.

What might be useful, in lieu of my notion about modifiying pragma
no-cache is to have a header line which indicates the data/time at
which the copy in the cache was snapshotted from the authoritative
server.

In a situation in which there are a cascade of caches, this date/time would
be the same for all.

The problem seems pretty simple - the browsers should allow the user to
set the default type for rendering (and this should be settable on the
fly) and the server's default type should be easy to set, too.  One of
the sites I maintain has mostly text files, so I set the default there to
text/plain.  This is consistant with "liberal with what you accept,
conservative with what you spend".

Sorry, but lets just switch positions for just a moment.  Say that we 
consider text/html as the default.  Say that you wanted to download a 
text/plain document.  Then the above would read:

HTTP servers probably should try to include a content-type: text/plain
anyway, if that's what they mean.


I mean, come on.  We are connecting to HTTP, "HyperText" Transfer 
Protocol, shouldn't the default be text/html?

Indeed.  I can see a lot more situations where I would want a default of 
text/plain than one of text/html.  I think at this point, it's a very 
good idea to have this configurable by server and browser.

There's been some confusion already, and at risk of making the
situation worse, I will try to clarify:

*1* I am NOT talking about what assumptions a httpd (HTTP server)
    should make in deciding what is the content-type of a file.

    This is clearly a configuration option of the server, and the
    administrator of the server should be able to set this to whatever
    is appropriate.

*2* I am NOT talking about what assumptions a web client should make
    for files that it retrieves via FTP, local-file, or other kinds of
    URLs.

    This is definitely a configuration issue, and the resolution
    is sticky, but a separate issue.

*3* I am ONLY talking about what happens in the case of a HTTP client
    that does a HTTP GET, and gets back a response that DOES NOT
    INCLUDE a Content-type header.

    Possible resolutions are:

    a) this is illegal. HTTP server should always include
    Content-type.

    b) Clients should guess, based on the suffix of the URL, as if
    this were a ftp or file URL.

    c) Clients should have a configuration default, and rely on that.

    d) The default should be text/plain.

    e) The default should be text/html.

(a) is not incompatible with any of the other resolutions. Personally,
I prefer (e). I'm not sure if Guido's note arguing for (d) was based
on the assumption I was talking about situation *1*. I think Simon's
note about MDMA is really talking about *1* or *2*, since in case *3*,
what the type-mapping tables is mainly irrelevant (unless you also are
suggesting resolution (b)). Erik Sink's note seems to be that (c) is
what is actually current practice, or already decided?

Brian's note saying "the browser should allow the user to set the
default type for rendering" is option (c), but that seems inferior to
all of the other choices. In any case, (c) doesn't really give any
guidance as to what the meaning of the protocol is, it just gives
guidence to browser writers as to how they should cope with the
current situation.

One of the specs did say quite clearly that text/plain is the default
type.  If I could remember which one it was I would tell you, but then
again it could have been changed without telling anyone as well.

HTTP 0.9 says text/plain; I don't think it's specified for HTTP/1.0, or if it
is it's hidden really well. I've had problems with some browsers when no 
Content-type is present, so I default for safety.

Hi,
	I'd like to mention a couple of updates regarding the recent
release, described in:

http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/dist/doc/admin/webtest/verify_links.html

	First, a "User-Agent" field has been added to the HTTP requests
issued during the link verification process. For the sake of you web
administrators out there, the agent is called the 
"EIT Link Verifier Robot /0.2".

	Secondly I've fixed an obscure/seldom-seen bug which only manifests
on the Solaris port. The bug was caused by a sleep function, which never
seemed to return under certain circumstances. I should have known better than
to use sleep anywhere. It's been fixed and is reflected in all binaries.

tkWWW Version 0.12 beta (joe@mit.edu)
--------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext project which seeks to build a
world wide network of hypertext links.  There are several different
browsers for this system including a simple tty interface.

Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily.

tkWWW is a Tk interface to (WWW).

Since the entire user interface is written in an interpreted language,
it is very easy to make modifications and extensions to the system.
tkWWW is the first X11 browser with the ability to edit HTML!!!!!

Requirements
------------
tkWWW requires the installation of the tk and tcl packages which can
be retrieved from sprite.berkely.edu

To display images, tkWWW requires the xli package which can be
retrieved from ftp.x.org

To Install the single executable version of tkWWW
-------------------------------------------------
In this directory

1. Type "./configure"
2. Type "make"
3. Type "make install"

To Install the interpreted version of tkWWW
-------------------------------------------
In this directory

1. Type "./configure"

This has been discussed before on www-talk, e.g.

  <http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-talk-1994q1.messages/992.html>


The relevent bit being a new header --

Cache-last-updated:
     should reflect the date/timestamp of last comparison with the original
     (i.e. the Date: header returned by the source document's HTTP server
     in that comparison).  Note that this should not be changed by cache
     managers more than once-removed from the origin.  This is because the
     act of checking the cache consistency with the original document is
     equivalent to getting a new copy of that document, but the act of
     checking cache consistency with a higher-level cache is only equivalent
     to copying that cache.


Has anyone implemented this?

Two comments to the current discussion:

1) Take a look at the specs at 

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html

   They say the following about Content-Type:

	"As defined in MIME..."

   Now take a look at the MIME spec, rfc1521: about unknown
   content-types:
	
	When a mail reader encounters mail with an unknown Content-type
	value, it should generally treat it as equivalent to
	"application/octet-stream", as described later in this document.

   So my conclusion is that the specs _do_ say how to handle the situation!

2) In my opinion a missing content-type is equivalent to an unknown
   content-type. I think it is a very narrow solution to assume that
   everything unknown is HTML (or plain text) - this does not comply
   with the normal level of abstraction in HTTP. The right thing
   for the client to do is to treat it as "application/octet-stream"
   and then dump the whole thing to a local file for further processing.

Actually, the question here is not what to do if the Content-type is
*unknown* -- we're discussing what to do if it is *missing*.  This is
also covered by MIME:

            Default RFC 822 messages are typed by this protocol as plain
            text  in the US-ASCII character set, which can be explicitly
            specified as "Content-type:  text/plain;  charset=us-ascii".
            If  no  Content-Type  is specified, either by error or by an
            older user agent, this default is assumed.

I disagree -- a missing content-type is probably caused by a careless
server (or CGI script), while an unknown one probably means that your
client software (or its .mailcap file) has to be upgraded.  Note that
if the content-type is specified as foo/bar, where foo is a known type
but bar is an unknown subtype of foo, the client should not default to
application/octet-stream but to something dependent on foo -- e.g. for
text/bar, text/plain should be assumed.

Okay, great and fine.  We may actually have a definition at hand that 
everyone should conform to.

I hate to do this, but if NCSA doesn't support it, then I get a load of
mail questioning why it won't work in Lynx.  I'm not up to it, especially
when all I have to do to avoid the problem is change one line of code.

Standard or not, "text/html" may indeed be the best choice for a client.
The user base has sorely misused this inconsistancy with this vague
standard by noticing it's possible through Mosaic.

Compliance to a standard is indeed a great factor.
Compliance to my users' requests, because they simply want it, is also a
        great factor.

In closing,
I am in support of application/octet-stream.
I've noticed sometimes that the content type of my mail messages will be 
missing, and my reader tells me that it can't handle it (though it is 
text/plain in actuallity), but that's not the mail reader's problem --

Let's put the responsibility of the screw ups where they need to belong.

This will make it quite clear to those testing their scripts and
servers that there is something wrong with the content-type they are
sending and not the client's ability to render text/*. 

I want to plead the writers of the cgi-bin scripts and of the server 
headers to correctly support the content type.

If you don't, then I will forever be receiving mail asking why their 
Mosaic can but their Lynx can't; knowing that not one of them will write 
NCSA saying "hey, you didn't parse your content-type correctly!"

No, not the viewer, the proxy. And I wasn't suggesting it, I thought I was 
describing established practice. If this is not correct, someone tell me please.

So, conceptually, what I was describing goes:

client GETs document, but this is routed via proxy cache

proxy HEADs document at original server

if (original_mod_date <= cached_mod_date) and not expired(cached_document)
then
	return cached_document
else
	GET new original document
	put it in cache
	return cached_document
endif

However, looking at Luotonen and Altis "World Wide Web Proxies", Adv. Proc WWW94 
pp50-51 there is an optimisation to accomplish this in one transaction instead of 
two:

<quote>
When it is essential that the retrieved document is up-to-date, it is necessary 
to contact the remote server for each GET request. The HTTP protocol already 
contains the HEAD method for retrieving a document's header information, but noit 
the document itself [...]

[...]it would be very inefficient to make a second connection to the remote 
server [...]

The HTTP protocol was therefore extended to contain an If-modified-since request 
header, making it possible to do a conditional GET request.
</quote>

I notice that I have penciled in a comment Ari made at the original talk:

"pragma: nocache gets the original version without going via the proxy. This 
might be put on the reload button"

I have also noted:

"proxies do not cache CGI documents and protected documents"

I hope this is a useful clarification.

I thought the expired date is used like this:

client GETs document, but this is routed via proxy cache

if expired(cached_document)
then
	proxy HEADs document at original server

	if (original_mod_date > cached_mod_date)
	then
		GET new original document
		put it in cache
	endif
endif

return cached_document

> The HTTP protocol was therefore extended to contain an If-modified-since request

This is an excellent optimization.  I'd also like to see a "standard"
document that a proxy can request that will return a list of all documents
modified since some date.  Sites that implement it would see a lot less
traffic from proxy servers.  Sites that don't aren't penalized.

The document could be named "/changes.txt" or maybe "/cgi-bin/changes".  It
would probably be computed on-the-fly from a document database.  I wouldn't
expect anybody to do it with a file system traversal, but that is certainly
possible.

This proposal is very similar to the standard "/robots.txt" document that
robots/spiders/mirrors/etc. use to behave nicely.

Assuming all of these optimizations:

client GETs document, but this is routed via proxy cache

if expired(cached_document)
then
	proxy GETs/If-Modified "/cgi-bin/changes" at original server

	if (original_mod_date > cached_mod_date)
	then
		proxy GETs/If-Modified document at original server
		put it in cache
	endif
endif

return cached_document

This algorithm works against all servers --- not just the ones implementing
/cgi-bin/changes.  It's an especially big win on servers with many
documents, or servers that have documents composed of many sub-documents ---
anytime it is likely that a client will GET more than two expired documents
from the same original server in the same session.

> "pragma: nocache gets the original version without going via the proxy. This 
> might be put on the reload button"

This is a good idea --- but instead of *not* going through the proxy, maybe
there should be a way to force the proxy to get the original document?

> "proxies do not cache CGI documents and protected documents"

How do you tell the difference?!  Unless a CGI script is located in /cgi-bin
or the server returns an expiration of zero, there isn't much information a
proxy can use to tell the difference.  I posted a long list of problems I
had with mirroring a few months ago.  This was one of my major problems.

As this discussions is all about proxy related stuff shouldn't it
have been started on www-proxy?

(Incidentally, remote robots would also love such a facility)

This is quite difficult unless you use a local robot; sorting out the
local virtual paths and the virtual URL spaces provided by cgi scripts
is impossible to do just from the configuration files.

For the Robot Exclusion this is less of a problem, as you generally
shut out entire URL trees, not every individual page in that tree. And
you don't care about modification dates.

I doubt this would be efficient on-the-fly, unless you have some mechanism
whereby anybody wanting to change a document has to somehow flag this
pro-actively -- which is a lot of administrative overhead.

If you use an unbounded local robot for web maintenance, then you
might as well have it look at and store "Last-Modified"s in an ls-lR
type file. But I wonder how many people would want to do this, and how
regularly.

/cgi-bin/changes would probably faster and more substantially than the
particular documents you're interested in. So you might well end up
negating any positive effect, even without the server-side problems.

Very, indeed.

@ *always*  include a  content-type  header line.   In other words,

This would be bad. Then a file such as say "my_text" would be served out
as "my_text.html" when it isnt, if Im reading the above correct.

@ 	Or  (again)  the clients could be  "smarter",  and upon seeing

Isnt this where the <!DOCTYPE...> comes in? But the problem is what
level of tag do you look for? Its the old story of what can we do
currently without breaking things. But we do need to go ahead and do
them before any more "damage" is done.

I would think that key things to look for would be:

	<!....> 	Any of <!--, <!DOCTYPE etc...
	<HTML>		obvious
	<HEAD>		Some people miss the <HTML>
	<BODY>		ditto
	<H1>		A lot of people here seem to start docs this way

Hrm, but that is cumbersome, and you cant rely on "<" as the 1st meaning
part of the message being right.

I cant offer any reasonable suggestions that would break things one way
or the other.

Perhaps this discussion shouldn't be in this list (which is intended 
primarily for developers) but there needs to be discussions between
software and protocol developers and those of us involved in user 
support.

I an setting up a RARE ISUS Task Force (RARE is the Association for 
Research Network in Europe and ISUS stands for Information Services 
and User Support) which will be cataloging and reviewing HTML 
convertors and authoring tools.   As described in my initial message, 
shown below, I am looking for volunteers to help in the review process.
Note that I am looking for people who are willing to make an active 
contribution.

I would also be interested in hearing from anyone involved in the 
development of HTML who would be interested in becoming involved 
in the report - advice for developers of HTML authoring tools would be 
appreciated.  

Please email me directly (B.Kelly@leeds.ac.uk)

Send reply to:    B.Kelly@leeds.ac.uk

At the WG-ISUS meeting held in Prague on 13-14th June it was agreed
to set up a new ISUS Task Force on Tools For Information Providers.
I agreed to lead the Task Force.  I will be producing a charter for the 
Task Force in the near future and producing a set of tasks, based on 
discussions that were held at Prague and comments and suggestions 
I receive from this list.

At the ISUS meeting it was agreed that the Task Force would initially
set out to produce a catalogue and review HTML authoring tools and
document convertors.  

Anyone who is interested in reviewing these tools (which will include 
programs such as HyperEdit, macros for Word and WordPerfect, Unix 
authoring tools. HotMetal, rtftohtml, etc) should mail me, stating the type 
of tools you would be willing to review (e.g. tools for the Mac or tools 
which you have experience of).

....

My model of the target "Information Provider" is a researcher in a 
department or an administrator in a department who wishes to make 
material available on an Internet service.

Subject: HTML and International Standards
content-length: 1978

I have been watching with interest the discussions in this list. It seems
to me that there is a family of software interfaces in this community that
are mature enough to merit "standardization". By this I mean the formal
codification of the interfaces into a standard by a ISO accredited
standards development organization (perhaps even ISO itself). By codifying
the stable interfaces, WWW application developers will be in a better
position to develop software that they can be confident will continue to be
supported by conforming implementaitons of both servers and clients. One of
the most significant advantages of standardization is that core features of
a system can be locked down even as the fringe continues to evolve. This
has been done successfully with other Open Systems interfaces such as
IEEE's POSIX.* and ANSI/ISO C.

It appears to me that the interfaces that are ready for standardization
include  parts of HTML (an SGML DTD), and some of the WWW library
interfaces. However, I am certainly no expert.

I expect that other members of this community have discussed the
possibility of standardizing portions of the WWW interfaces before, but I
wanted to raise the issue again. There are a number of Standards
Development Organizations in the world that would be happy to sponsor new
standards in such an important area.

Until recently I was an officer in the IEEE POSIX activities, and I have a
lot of experience with starting and developing standards in the US and
international arena. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to promote these
particular interfaces, mostly because of lack of expertise. Many of you are
in such a position. If there is sufficient support, I would be happy to
volunteer my expertise in developing standards to help get things rolling.

Subject: W3A - update and questions

W3A, the WWW Applets API proposal, has been updated again. It now
supports nested viewers (useful for in-line images and compound
documents). See: <http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A/W3A.html>

I still have some questions that I can't answer satisfactorily myself.
Surely somebody on this list is able to answer them:


Paths (guided tours):

	HTML 3.0 will support `paths' and there are probably other
	hypertext formats or slideshow programs that have a similar
	feature. In W3A paths are not handled by the browser, but by a
	viewer. That means that the documents on the path are
	considered sub-documents of the viewer that handles the path.
	Currently this also means that they will not appear in the
	browser's history (if it keeps one) and that it is impossible
	to add them to a hotlist.

	Is this OK? if not, how can it be fixed?

Platform-independence:

	Viewers need to display their output in a window provided by
	the browser. Under X, it is easy to pass a widget as an
	argument to the viewer. Is there an equivalent datastructure
	under MS Windows, or on the Mac? Requirements are that the
	viewer is able to draw in it, maybe make sub-windows in it and
	make its preferences about the size of the window known to the
	owner of the parent window.

	How about a text-mode browser? The window argument will be a
	dummy, since there are no windows on a text terminal, or are
	there?

Distributed browsers:

	It would be nice to be able to distribute the browser over
	several machines in a network, running each applet on the
	machine best suited for it. Is this worth the extra effort?
	How easy and useful would it be, for example to re-specify W3A
	in IDL and use CORBA services?

Synchronization:

	A viewer for a compound document (such as a HyTime document)
	can start sub-viewers to display the components of the
	document. It can place them in their proper spatial positions
	and it can start them approximately at the same time and it
	can stop them again, but beyond that there is no
	synchronization.

	Should W3A specify a general `event' mechanism, whereby
	viewers can register callbacks for a specific, abstract event?
	E.g.,

		W3AregisterEventCallback(void *type, HandlerProc proc)
		W3AtriggerEvent(void *type)

	Maybe we also need a clock? It's probably better not to
	specify this yet.

Before launching into the following (long) reply, the point that I really
want to make is that I would like master servers, but *not* cache servers to
generate the following header line whenever they send a document.

snapshot-date: <date>

Launching...

Thanks for the reference.  I'll deal with that e-mail at the end of this note.

Cache-last-updated isn't quite what we need.  What is needed is the
time the copy in the cache was separated from the master source.

While it might be nice to know how long something has resided in a
cache, for management or statistical purposes, what is useful to users
is how long it has been since the cache copy has been unlinked (as it
were) from the original.

Now for that prior message....

Even a single level cache needs to provide information to the client
so that the client can decide whether to accept the copy in the cache
or to cut through the cache and go right to the horse's mouth for an
up-to-the-minute version.

Perhaps that new version is identical to what is in the cache.  But at
least the user knows that he/she/it has the most recent document
available.

But some users are willing to accept information which may be slightly
stale.  How stale is acceptable can only be determined by the
user/client.  The degree of "staleness" is not how long something has
lain in a cache, but how long since the cacached copy has been
synchronized with the master version, in otherwords, how long since
the master server dispensed with the copy in the cache.

This, of course, can be easily represented if all non-caching servers
added the following line when they deliver a document

snapshot-date: <date>

Cache servers must not generate this.  It can be generated only by the
actual repository.

A client can fetch the header, look at it and then decide whether
to issue a no-cache GET.

I agree that it isn't a useful piece of information for the most part.
It is useful, however for management purposes.

I'm not sure that this is a useful piece of information either, except for
management purposes.

Agreed.

I've actually generated loops myself with the Cern caching httpd.  I accidently
fired it up with an http_proxy environment variable pointing to itself.
It stopped when I ran out of process slots.

Again, I think this is a nice thing to have.  It will certainly let people
know when their caching gets too deep.

There are problems with the approach you described.

First of all, it does take two queries, one to the cache and one to the master.

(BTW, If the cache is being used as a firewall, then recourse to the master is
not possible.)

Second, it does not deal with the situation I am describing: when the user
wants recent, but not necessarily the latest information.

The approach which I am suggesting, that the master server put in a 
snapshot-date: <date> header line would solve all of this.

If the user/client wants the latest and greatest, it simply uses
pragma no-cache otherwise if can grab the header from the cache and
see whether the cached version is new enough.  If it is, then a cached
GET is performed, otherwise the pragma no-cache is used and the cache
is refreshed and the user gets the latest version.

It doesn't always work.

1. The proxy/cache may be a firewall and the original server is not reachable.
   (or the original server may be down because it crashed under the load ;-)

2. It is inefficient, unnecessarily bothering the original server when all the
user wants is recent, but not necessarily the absolute latest version.

It *will* always work.

If the document is not expired, then the proxy just returns it --- no need
for the orignal server to be available.  Non-proxy servers will never have
an expired article (obviously!)  so this applies to them as well.

If the original server is down or unreachable then the get will fail, the
cache will not be updated and the proxy will simply return the cached
document (if it exists.)  The "return cached_document" is *outside* the
conditional.

If the proxy can *never* get to the original server, then the cache will
never be loaded and the document is never reachable.  In this case, you must
load the "proxy" through some other mechanism --- i.e. not HTTP.  Therefore,
the whole idea of proxy/firewall servers won't work for you and none of this
discussion applies.

> 2. It is inefficient, unnecessarily bothering the original server when all the

The original server is only "bothered" when the cache expires.  And it will
only be "bothered" once to validate all documents that may be cached on the
proxy.  If the idea of dynamically updating the proxy cache is undesirable,
then simply add code to the expiration logic to restrict cache updates to
some other criteria.  If you want some way of having a client explicitly
tell the server:  "Give me whatever you have right now without checking
anything first" then extra information must be passed along with the get
request.  Anybody know how this can be done?

Someone recently used a stock market as an example of a type of document
that should have different expirations.  This is an easy thing to solve:

	During the day, the quotes are updated every 5 (or some small n)
	minutes.  So set the expiration for 5 minutes.

	The last quote of the day won't expire until 5 minutes after the
	opening of the market on the next business day.  So set the
	expiration for then.

Another example of classic literature was posted.  This is also easy:

	For static documents (i.e. the author has no intention of ever
	changing it) set the expiration the expiration to infinity.

Do we have a notation for infinity?

The idea in the previous examples is to show that a server can often be
"smarter" than a person in deciding when the document cache should be
refreshed.  Why should the system require a reader to understand when the
information is old?  Pure performance hints are something else... but there
I would still like to see the reader put limits on the cost of the transaction
instead of trying to explicitly tell the server how to do something.

You could use this same cache update algorithm to selectively mirror/update
a server.  You don't *have* to do it via a usage-driven proxy... but that's
probably the easiest/best way to do it.  I can think of only two reasons not
to do it that way:  (1) you have a slow/congested/unreliable link and want to
schedule (i.e. batch) cache updates; (2) you have a security mechanism that
requires hand auditing/verification of the contents of the cache.

You are right, I mis-read your code to say the "client" fetched
from the original server.

However, I think you are misunderstanding my subsequent objections.

The idea that the server puts an expiration date on data only solves
part of the overall problem.  It warns clients & caches that the image
they have has expired.

The if-modified-since header modifier for GET is useful to ensure
that the copy one has is the absolutely latest that is available.

The problem these mechanisms do not solve is that of the client who
wants recent data but who can get buy without paying the cost for the
absolute latest version.

I assert that this is an extremely common need.

And it is extremely costly of network resource (and wasted user time)
to give the binary choice of living with what is in the cache or
verifying (and retrieving) the absolute latest version.

I was the one who put forth the example of the stock charts.  Your
modified version of my example had new charts generated every 5
minutes, so the server could make a good guess as to the expiration
time.  However, data that is generated at random times during the day,
for example, the list of trades which have occured can not be given a
useful "expire date", it can only be updated at the master server.  Or
another example, the database that comes back when you "finger
quake@geophys.washington.edu" is updated at quite random intervals.

So, suppose I want to know the list of earthquakes which have occurred
over the last 12 months.  I probably don't care that the list I get
back is 100% up to date, so I want to say to my WWW client, get me the
list as it was anytime in the last 24 hours.

If I'm going through a cache, the current design doesn't give my
client enough information to decide whether the cached version is new
enough.  I can learn that the document in the cache was generated 72
hours ago, but that doesn't give me any clue whether a newer version
may exist.

If, however, the cached image contains a timestamp showing when it was
last taken from the master image, then my client can know that the
document in the cache is accurate as of that time and can use that
time to determine whether the cached image is new enough for my needs.

It may very well be in practice that I end up refreshing the cache with
an identical copy -- identical that is except for the timestamp which
indicates when it was copied from the authoritative server.

The publisher of information can only put an upper bound on its value.

And, what I think people are missing, is that there is a middle ground between
the absolutely most recent version of a document and the version that is in
the cache.

If I have a client that needs recent, but not absolutely the latest
version, of a document, the current architecture forces the client to
force a cache miss.  That is extremely inefficient and wasteful.

Now that I'm back from the left coast, I've actually set up the list...
-----

Good evening one and all, and welcome to www-speed. 

The list address is www-speed@tipper.oit.unc.edu
The request address is www-speed-request@tipper.oit.unc.edu

This list is dedicated to the proposition that the web is just too darned
slow, and that some of its key components have inherent performance problems
that cannot be dealt with without changes to protocols.

Topics appropriate to the list are:

	o Performance issues in existing implementations
	o Managing busy servers
	o Benchmarking servers
	o High performance Server design
	o High speed (130Mbps+) issues
	o Client implementation
	o HTTP - beyond 1.0
	o Other performance and scalability issues

Initially, I plan to be concentrating on issues related to the HTTP protocol.
I will be sending a series of messages over the next few days analysing the
performance implications of HTTP, and discussing several alternatives that
have been proposed to improve performance. 

The first post will cover the problems with HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0.
This will be followed by a comparison of several proposed changes to 
HTTP to alleviate these problems. I'll then wrap up with more detailed coverage
of the FHTTP protocol I mooted briefly on www-talk.

	I feel the need - the need for speed

They already do -- it's called the "Date:" header.  How the cache managers
interpret/use that information is what matters.

I'm sorry, but that is exactly what Cache-last-updated would provide.
It represents the exact timestamp which the master server generated when
it sent the original copy.  To get the "how long" info, just subtract
Cache-last-updated from the current timestamp (after conversion, of course).
If there is no Cache-last-updated header, then the message came straight
from the master source.

For the WWW client I wrote for VM, I chose:

      f) If it contains control chars (in the range 0x00-0x1f and 
         0x80-0x9f except for CR+LF+FF+HT) it must be binary; else 
         if the upcase of the file suffix is HTM or HTML or if the file 
         contains (upcased) tags such as <HTML> or <HEAD> or <TITLE> or 
         <PRE> then it must be HTML.  Otherwise it must be plaintext.
         I also use this same rule to handle documents retrieved via ftp, 
         gopher, etc. 

I claim this method follows the "rule of least surprise".

This is the first in a series of reports on performance problems in
the web, and how they can be addressed. This paper discusses some
problems with HTTP/1.0. It includes a step by step walk through of
HTTP as seen through the eyes of a packet sniffer, together with
a look at how various changes to the protocol model could improve
performance. 

I'll be following this up in a couple of days with a comparative
review of several proposed changes to HTTP.

This paper is a first draft; there are still some parts that need more

in HTML. I'll also be putting a copy of the html version up on the WWW-SPEED
server (currently http://elanor.oit.unc.edu/)

Y'all have fun now,

p.s.

Since this is of reasonably general interest, and since www-speed is a 
new list, I'm Cc:ing www-talk. I'll try and avoid this in the future.

Title:	Analysis of HTTP Performance problems

Author: Simon E Spero

Abstract:

 This paper is the first in a series on performance issues in the
	   World Wide Web.

 HTTP is a transfer protocol used by the World Wide Web distributed
	hypermedia system to retrieve distributed objects. HTTP uses TCP as
	a transport layer. Certain design features of HTTP interact badly with
	TCP, causing problems with performance and with server scalability.
	Latency problems are caused by opening a single connection per request,
	through connection setup and slow-start costs. Further avoidable 
	latency is incurred due to the protocol only returning a single object
	per request. Scalability problems are caused by TCP requring a server
	to maintain state for all recently closed connections.

------------------------------

Summary of HTTP/1.0
-------------------

HTTP [http] is a transfer protocol used by the World Wide Web to
retrieve information from distributed servers. The HTTP model is
extremely simple; the client establishes a connection to the remote
server, then issues a request. The server then processes the request,
returns a response, and closes the connection.

Requests.

 The request format for HTTP is quite simple. The first line specifies
an object, together with the name of an object to apply the method
to. The most commonly used method is "GET", which ask the server to
send a copy of the object to the client.

 The client can also send a series of optional headers; these headers are
in RFC-822 format. The most common headers are "Accept", which tells the server
which object types the client can handle, and "User-Agent", which gives the
implementation name of the client.


Request syntax.
 
<METHOD> <URI> "HTTP/1.0" <crlf>
{<Header>: <Value> <crlf>}* 
<crlf>


Example.

GET  /index.html HTTP/1.0
Accept: text/plain
Accept: text/html
Accept: */*
User-Agent:  Yet Another User Agent



Responses.

The response format is also quite simple. Responses start with a
status line indicating which version of HTTP the server is running,
together with a result code and an optional message.

This is followed by a series of optional object headers; the most
important of these are "Content-Type", which describes the type of the
object being returned, and "Content-Length", which indicates the
length.The headers are teminated by an empty line.

The server now sends any requested data. After the data have been
sent, the server drops the connection.


Response syntax.
 
"HTTP/1.0" <result-code> [<message>]  <crlf>
{<Header>: <Value> <crlf>}* 
<crlf>



Example.

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: MDMA/0.1
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html
Last-Modified: Thu Jul  7 00:25:33 1994

Access Patterns
---------------

 HTTP accesses usually exhibit a common pattern of behaviour. A client
requests a hypertext page, then issues a sequence of requests to
retrieve any icons referenced in the first document. Once the client
has retrieved the icons, the user will typically select a hypertext
link to follow. In the majority of cases, the referenced page will be
on the same server as the original page.



HTTP Illustrated
----------------

 The problems with HTTP can best be understood by looking at the
network traffic generated by a typical HTTP transaction. This example
was generated by using Van Jacobsen's tcpdump program to monitor a
client at UNC fetching a copy of the NCSA Home page. This page is 1668
bytes long, including response headers. The client at UNC was a Sun
Sparcstation 20/512, running Solaris 2.3. The server at NCSA was a
Hewlett Packard 9000/735 running HP-UX.

The headers used in the request shown were captured from an xmosaic
request.  The headers consisted of 42 lines totaling around 1130
bytes; of these lines, 41 were "Accept".


**Stage 1: Time = 0**

The trace begins with the client sending a connection request to the
http port on the server

.00000 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: S 2785173504:2785173504(0) win 8760 <mss 1460> (DF)




**Stage 2: Time = 0.077**

 The server responds to the connect request with a connect
response. The client acknowledges the connect response, and send the
first 536 bytes of the request.

.07769 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: S 530752000:530752000(0) ack 2785173505 win 8192
.07784 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: . ack 1 win 9112 (DF)
.07989 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: P 1:537(536) ack 1 win 9112 (DF)




**Stage 3: Time = 0.35**

 The server acknowledges the first part of the request. The client
then sends the second part, and without waiting for a response,
follows up with the third and final part of the request.

.35079 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: . ack 537 win 8192
.35092 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: . 537:1073(536) ack 1 win 9112 (DF)
.35104 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: P 1073:1147(74) ack 1 win 9112 (DF)


**Stage 4: Time = 0.45**

 The server sends a packet acknowledging the second and third parts of
the request, and containing the first 512 bytes of the response. It
follows this with another packet containing the second 512 bytes.
 The client then sends a message acknowledging the first two response
packets.

.45116 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: . 1:513(512) ack 1147 win 8190
.45473 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: . 513:1025(512) ack 1147 win 8190
.45492 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: . ack 1025 win 9112 (DF)


**Stage 5: Time = 0.53**

 The server sends the third and fourth response packet. The fourth
packet also contains a flag indicating that the connection is being
closed. The client acknowledges the data, then sends a message
announcing that it too is closing the connection. From the point of
view of the client program, the transaction is now over.

.52521 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: . 1025:1537(512) ack 1147 win 8190
.52746 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: FP 1537:1853(316) ack 1147 win 8190
.52755 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: . ack 1854 win 9112 (DF)
.52876 unc.32840 > ncsa.80: F 1147:1147(0) ack 1854 win 9112 (DF)


**Stage 6: Time = 0.60**

The server acknowledges the close.

.59904 ncsa.80 > unc.32840: . ack 1148 win 8189


Very nice, but what does it all mean?
-------------------------------------

 This trace is quite revealing. It seems that HTTP spends more time
waiting than it does transferring data.  Before we take a look at what
causes these delays, we'll calculate a couple of metrics that will
help us work out what's going on.

 One important metric is the Round Trip Time (RTT). This is the time
taken to sent a packet from one end of the connection to the other and
back. Look at the gap between stages one and two, and between stages
five and six, we can see that in our example, the RTT is around 70
milliseconds.

 Another important metric is the bandwidth of the connection. This is
a measure of how many bits per second our connection can carry. We can
establish a lower bound on the available bandwidth by noting how long
it took to send one of the data packets.

 The two data packets in stage four arrive with a gap of 3.57 ms;
since each packet carries 512 bytes of data, this puts a lower limit
on the available bandwidth of about 1.15 Mbps (143,750 MBps).


Connection Establishment.

 TCP establishes connections via a three-way handshake. The client
sends a connection request, the server responds, and the client
acknowledges the response. The client can send data along with the
acknowledgement.

 Since the client must wait for the server to send its connection
response, this procedure sets a lower bound on the transaction time of
two RTTs.


Data transfer: Segments.

When TCP transfers a stream data, it breaks up the stream into small
segments.  The size of each segment can vary up to a maximum segement
size (MSS). Although the segment size can be negotiated (the UNC host
advertises an MSS of 1460 bytes in the first packet), this negotiation
is optional. For remote connections, the MSS defaults to 536 bytes.

Since the NCSA host did not advertise an MSS, the UNC host uses the
default value of 536 for this session.


Data transfer: Windows and Slow Start.

 Instead of having to wait for each packet to be acknowledged, TCP
allows the sender to send out new segments even though it may not have
received acknowledgements for previous segments.

 To prevent the sender from overflowing the receivers buffers, in each
segment the receiver tells the sender how much data it is prepared to
accept without acknowledgments. This value is known as the window
size.

 Although the window size tells the sender the maximum amount of
unacknowledged data the receiver is prepared to let it have
outstanding, the receiver cannot know how much data the connecting
networks are prepared to carry. If the network is quite congested,
sending a full windows worth of data will cause even worse
congestion. The ideal transmission rate is one in which
acknowledgements and outgoing packets enter the network at the same
rate.

 TCP determines the best rate to use through a process called Slow
Start.  With Slow Start, the sender maintains calculates a second
window of unacknowledged segments known as the Congestion Window. When
a connection first starts up, each sender is only allowed to have a
single unacknowledged segement in transit. Every time a segment is
acknowledged without loss, the congestion window is opened; every time
a segement is lost and times out, the window is closed.

 This approach is ideal for normal connections; these connections tend
to last a relatively long time, and the effects of slow start are
negligible.  However, for short lived connections like those used in
HTTP, the effect of slow start is devestating.


How Slow Start affects HTTP.

 HTTP is hurt by slow start on both the client and server sides.
Because the HTTP headers are longer than the MSS, the client TCP needs
to use two segments (Stage 2). Because the congestion window is
initialised to one, we need to wait for the first segment to be
acknowledged before we can send the second and third (Stage 3). This
adds an extra RTT onto the minimum time for the transaction.

 When the server is ready to send the response, it starts with a
congestion window set to 2. This is because the acknowledgement it
sent in Stage 3 counts is counted as a successful transmission,
allowing the congestion window to open up a notch before it comes time
to send data.

 Although the servers congestion window is already slightly open, it
still doesn't have enough a big enough gap to send the entire response
without pausing. In Stage 4, the server sends two segments carrying a
combined 1K of data, but then needs to wait to receive the
acknowledgement from the client before it can send the final two
segments in Stage 5.

 Since most pages are larger than 1K in size, slow start in the server
will typically add at least one RTT to the total transaction
time. Longer documents may experience several more slow start induced
delays, until the congestion window is as big as the recievers window.

 Readers should note that if the server were to support the negotition
of larger MSS, this particular transaction would not have incurred any
slow start delays. However, typical document sizes will cause at least
one slow start pause when sending the result.


Latency and Bandwidth
---------------------

 Latency and Bandwidth are the two keys to protocol
performance. Latency, as measured by the RTT, is a measure of the
fixed costs of a transaction and does not change as documents get
bigger or smaller.  Bandwidth, as we discussed earlier, is a measure
of how long it takes to send data.

Future Networks.

 Improving available bandwidth is relatively easy. All you need to do
is buy a faster network. Reducing latency is somewhat harder- there
are only two known ways to achieve this; either change the speed of
light, or move. Since placing workstations in particle accelerators
has been known to cause data loss, and since the second approach is in
general contrary to the philosphy of distributed systems, latency is
increasingly becoming the dominant factor in protocol performance.


Effects of opening a new connection per transaction
---------------------------------------------------

The cost of opening a new connection for each transaction can be
clearly seen by estimating the transaction time as it would have been
if we had been reusing an existing connection.

 In our example, the total transaction time was 530 ms

 If were reusing an existing connection the transaction time could be
calculated as the time to send the request plus the round trip time,
plus any processing time on the server, plus the time to send the
response. The only figure in this list for which we have no estimate
is that for server processing time. This depends heavily upon machine
load, but for our purposes, we can take the gap between sending the
request and recieving the response, and subtract the response time
(Stages 3 and 4). In this case, the approximate value is about 30 ms.

 Using the above method, the expected transaction time for an already
open server would be

(1,146 / 143,750) + 0.07 + 0.03 + (1854 / 143,750), or abour 120 ms.


Effects Of Requesting A Single Object Per Transaction
-----------------------------------------------------

 Because HTTP has no way to ask for multiple objects with a single
request, each fetch requires a single transaction. With the current
protocol, this would require a new connection to be set up; however,
even if the connection were to be kept open, each request/response
pair would incur a separate round trip delay.

 As an example, lets consider fetching ten documents, each the same
size as the one we've been considering. For HTTP/1.0, the total time
would be 5,300 ms. For the long-lived connection, the total
transaction time will be 1,200 ms.

 Ignoring any possible savings in header size and processing time, if
we were to combine all the requests and responses into a single
message, the total transaction time would be 10 * (3000/143,750) +
0.07 + (0.03 * 10), or 580 ms. If we assume that the optional headers
are only sent once, then the total time per transaction is 520ms.  In
this model, processing time is the dominant factor. If we further
assume that a proportion of processing time is independent of the
number of objects requested, then the total time can be as low as
250ms (150ms transfer, 70ms latency, 30ms processing time).

 On a gigabit network, the transfer time becomes insignificant. On
such a network, the total time for the sequence of HTTP/1.0 requests
would be approximately 5,100ms. If multiple objects per request were
allowed over an already open channel, the total time would be 100ms.



Other Problems
--------------

 One scalability problem caused by the single request per connection
paradigm occurs due to TCP's TIME_WAIT state. When a server closes a
TCP, connection, it is required to keep information about that
connection for a period of time, in case a delayed packet turns up and
sabotages a new incarnation of the connection.

 The recommended time to keep this information is 240 seconds. Because
of this, a server will leave some resources allocated for every single
connection closed in the past four minutes. On a busy server, this can
add up to thousands of control blocks.



Summary
-------

 HTTP/1.0 interacts badly with TCP. It incurs frequent round-trip
delays due to connection establishment, performs slow start in both
directions for short duration connections, and incurs heavy latency
penalties due to the mismatch of the typical access profiles with the
single request per transaction model. HTTP/1.0 also requires busy
servers to dedicate resources to mainting TIME_WAIT information for
large numbers of closed connections.

<h2>Summary of HTTP/1.0</h2>

HTTP =

<A href=3D"#http">[http]</a> is a transfer protocol used by the World
Wide Web to retrieve information from distributed servers. The HTTP
model is extremely simple; the client establishes a connection to the
remote server, then issues a request. The server then processes the
request, returns a response, and closes the connection.
<p>
<h3>Requests</h3>
 The request format for HTTP is quite simple. The first line
specifies an object, together with the name of an object to apply the
method to. The most commonly used method is "GET", which ask the
server to send a copy of the object to the client.
<p>
 The client can also send a series of optional headers; these headers are
in RFC-822 format. The most common headers are "Accept", which tells the s=
erver
which object types the client can handle, and "User-Agent", which gives th=
e
implementation name of the client.
<p>

<h3>Request syntax</h3>
<pre> =

&lt;METHOD&gt; &lt;URI&gt; "HTTP/1.0" &lt;crlf&gt;
{&lt;Header&gt;: &lt;Value&gt; &lt;crlf&gt;}* =

&lt;crlf&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>GET  /index.html HTTP/1.0
Accept: text/plain
Accept: text/html
Accept: */*
User-Agent:  Yet Another User Agent
</pre>
<p>

<h3>Responses</h3>
The response format is also quite simple. Responses start with a
status line indicating which version of HTTP the server is running,
together with a result code and an optional message.
<p>
This is followed by a series of optional object headers; the most importan=
t =

of these are "Content-Type", which describes the type of the object being
returned, and "Content-Length", which indicates the length.The headers are=
 =

teminated by an empty line.
<p>
The server now sends any requested data. After the data have been
sent, the server drops the connection.
<p>

<h3>Response syntax</h3>
<pre> =

"HTTP/1.0" &lt;result-code&gt; [&lt;message&gt;]  &lt;crlf&gt;
{&lt;Header&gt;: &lt;Value&gt; &lt;crlf&gt;}* =

&lt;crlf&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: MDMA/0.1
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html
Last-Modified: Thu Jul  7 00:25:33 1994
Content-Length: 2003

<h2>Access Patterns</h2>
 HTTP accesses usually exhibit a common pattern of behaviour. A client =

requests a hypertext page, then issues a sequence of requests to retrieve =

any icons referenced in the first document. Once the client has retrieved =

the icons, the user will typically select a hypertext link to follow. In t=
he
majority of cases, the referenced page will be on the same server as the =

original page.
<p>

</hr>
<h2>HTTP Illustrated</h2>
 The problems with HTTP can best be understood by looking at the
network traffic generated by a typical HTTP transaction. This example
was generated by using Van Jacobsen's tcpdump program to monitor a
client at UNC fetching a copy of the NCSA Home page. This page is 1668
bytes long, including response headers. The client at UNC was a =

Sun Sparcstation 20/512, running Solaris 2.3. The server at NCSA was a =

Hewlett Packard 9000/735 running HP-UX.
<p>
The headers used in the request shown were captured from an xmosaic reques=
t.
The headers consisted of 42 lines totaling around 1130 bytes; of these
lines, 41 were "Accept". =


<p>
<h3>Stage 1: Time =3D 0</h3>
The trace begins with the  client sending a connection request to the http
port on the server
<pre>.00000 unc.32840 &gt; ncsa.80: S 2785173504:2785173504(0) win 8760 &l=
t;mss 1460&gt; (DF)
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Stage 2: Time =3D 0.077</h3>
 The server responds to the connect request with a connect =

response. The client acknowledges the connect response, and send the first=
 =

536 bytes of the request.
<pre>.07769 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: S 530752000:530752000(0) ack 278517350=

.07989 unc.32840 &gt; ncsa.80: P 1:537(536) ack 1 win 9112 (DF)
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Stage 3: Time =3D 0.35</h3>
 The server acknowledges the first part of the request. The client then
sends the second part, and without waiting for a response, follows up with
the third and final part of the request.
<pre>.35079 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: . ack 537 win 8192
.35092 unc.32840 &gt; ncsa.80: . 537:1073(536) ack 1 win 9112 (DF)
.35104 unc.32840 &gt; ncsa.80: P 1073:1147(74) ack 1 win 9112 (DF)
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Stage 4: Time =3D 0.45</h3>
 The server sends a packet acknowledging the second and third parts of =

the request, and containing the first 512 bytes of the response. It =

follows this with another packet containing the second 512 bytes.
 The client then sends a message acknowledging the first two response
packets.

<pre>.45116 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: . 1:513(512) ack 1147 win 8190
.45473 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: . 513:1025(512) ack 1147 win 8190
.45492 unc.32840 &gt; ncsa.80: . ack 1025 win 9112 (DF)
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Stage 5: Time =3D 0.53</h3>
 The server sends the third and fourth response packet. The fourth packet =

also contains a flag indicating that the connection is being closed. The =

client acknowledges the data, then sends a message announcing that it too =
is =

closing the connection. From the point of view of the client program, the
transaction is now over.

<pre>.52521 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: . 1025:1537(512) ack 1147 win 8190
.52746 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: FP 1537:1853(316) ack 1147 win 8190

.52876 unc.32840 &gt; ncsa.80: F 1147:1147(0) ack 1854 win 9112 (DF)
</pre>
<p>

<h3>Stage 6: Time =3D 0.60</h3>
The server acknowledges the close.
<pre>.59904 ncsa.80 &gt; unc.32840: . ack 1148 win 8189
</pre>
<p>


</hr>
<h2>Very nice, but what does it all mean</h2>
 This trace is quite revealing. It seems that HTTP spends more time
waiting than it does transferring data.  Before we take a look at what
causes these delays, we'll calculate a couple of metrics that will help
us work out what's going on.
<p>
 One important metric is the Round Trip Time (RTT). This is the
time taken to sent a packet from one end of the connection to the
other and back. Look at the gap between stages one and two, and
between stages five and six, we can see that in our example, the RTT
is around 70 milliseconds.
<p>
 Another important metric is the bandwidth of the connection. This is =

a measure of how many bits per second our connection can carry. We can =

establish a lower bound on the available bandwidth by noting how long
it took to send one of the data packets. =

<p>
 The two data packets in stage four arrive with a gap of 3.57 ms;
since each packet carries 512 bytes of data, this puts a lower limit on th=
e
available bandwidth of about 1.15 Mbps (143,750 MBps).

<p>
<h3>Connection Establishment</h3>
 TCP establishes connections via a three-way handshake. The client sends
a connection request, the server responds, and the client acknowledges the=
 =

response. The client can send data along with the acknowledgement.
<p>
 Since the client must wait for the server to send its connection response=
,
this procedure sets a lower bound on the transaction time of two RTTs.
<p>

<h3>Data transfer: Segments</h3>
When TCP transfers a stream data, it breaks up the stream into small segme=
nts.
The size of each segment can vary up to a maximum segement size (MSS). Alt=
hough
the segment size can be negotiated (the UNC host advertises an MSS of =

1460 bytes in the first packet), this negotiation is optional. For remote =

connections, the MSS defaults to 536 bytes. =

<p>
Since the NCSA host did not advertise an MSS, the UNC host uses the
default value of 536 for this session.
<p>

<h3>Data transfer: Windows and Slow Start</h3>
 Instead of  having to wait for each packet to be acknowledged, TCP allows
the sender to send out new segments even though it may not have received
acknowledgements for previous segments. =

<p>
 To prevent the sender from overflowing the receivers buffers, in =

each segment the receiver tells the sender how much data it is prepared to=
 =

accept without acknowledgments. This value is known as the window size.
<p>
 Although the window size tells the sender the maximum amount of =

unacknowledged data the receiver is prepared to let it have outstanding, t=
he
receiver cannot know how much data the connecting networks are prepared to
carry. If the network is quite congested, sending a full windows worth of =
data
will cause even worse congestion. The ideal transmission rate is one in
which acknowledgements and outgoing packets enter the network at the same =
rate.
<p>
 TCP determines the best rate to use through a process called Slow Start. =

With Slow Start, the sender maintains calculates a second window of
unacknowledged segments known as the Congestion Window. When a connection =
first
starts up, each sender is only allowed to have a single unacknowledged =

segement in transit. Every time a segment is  acknowledged without loss, t=
he =

congestion window is opened; every time a segement is lost and times out, =

the window is closed. =

<p>
 This approach is ideal for normal connections; these connections tend
to last a relatively long time, and the effects of slow start are negligib=
le.
However, for short lived connections like those used in HTTP, the effect o=
f
slow start is devestating.
<p>

<h3>How Slow Start affects HTTP</h3>
 HTTP is hurt by slow start on both the client and server
sides.  Because the HTTP headers are longer than the MSS, the client
TCP needs to use two segments (Stage 2). Because the congestion window
is initialised to one, we need to wait for the first segment to be
acknowledged before we can send the second and third (Stage 3). This adds =
an
extra RTT onto the minimum time for the transaction.
<p>
 When the server is ready to send the response, it starts with a congestio=
n
window set to 2. This is because the acknowledgement it sent in Stage 3 co=
unts
is counted  as a successful transmission, allowing the congestion window t=
o
open up a notch before it comes time to send data. =

<p>

doesn't have enough a big enough gap to send the entire response without =

pausing. In Stage 4, the server sends two segments carrying a combined =

1K of data, but then needs to wait to receive the acknowledgement from
the client before it can send the final two segments in Stage 5.
<p>
 Since most pages  are larger than 1K in size, slow start in the server =

will typically add at least one RTT to the total transaction time. Longer =

documents may  experience several more slow start induced delays, until th=

I've had to deal with this problem as documents I'm responsible for
maintaining have gotten large and unwieldy.  I've found that people do
prefer multipart documents, with one exception -- single, monolithic documents
are preferred by those who want to be able make a copy of the document for
reference, or to print it.

My stab at solving this problem was to write a Perl script which could
generate one of two "views" of a document.  One view is a multi-part view,
which different sections being in different documents, while the other is
the single-part view, with all sections in the same document.

The script is fairly primitive -- it only works well with a traditional
linear document (a tree one level deep).  It uses the LINK "subdocument"
and "precedes" (? I'm reading mail offline currently, so please forgive me
if I get this wrong :) relationships to specify the tree, and generates
the appropriate HTML document.  It is surprisingly useful, at least within
a limited range of documents.

The script -- and an example of its use -- is at
"http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/multiview/".  As yet, there
remains no write-up of how the script works, largely because I haven't had
the time to write one up yet.  Maybe in August :).

I've got a document that is hardly the be-all and end-all of how HTML should
and shouldn't be composed, but is still a fairly comprehensive shot at
what you're asking for.  My disclaimer, tho, is that it still needs polishing,
and I'm sure some of it is out-of-date or innaccurate since January, when
I wrote it.

It's called "Composing 'Good' HTML", and it's at
"http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/strict-html.html".  Comments are
welcome, but I doubt it'll get modified until August (when the happy
coincidences of free time and free access once again conflate...).

	You're not.   I meant  "tacking on .html"  as a data maintainer 
operation.   Ie:  "what's so hard about naming the file such that the 
server will know explicitly that it's to be interpreted as HTML". 
Thus the server could label it so in the header with maximum confidence.

  Seems like these are both being pursued already.  Dan Connolly and Tim
Berners-Lee are working on the HTML specification and turning it into an
official RFC.  Seems like the MIT and CERN partnership will most likely
take care of the client-side API.

Currently, there is type guessing going on in both the httpd and (CERN-
library-based) browsers to result in a (hopefully accurate) Content-Type.
However, when the Content-Type is not specified in the HTTP reply header,
why does there have to be default ?

Why can't "I don't know" be a valid reply ?

If you define a default, then any compliant httpd would always stuff in
that default.  Thus, the uncertainty about the document content is lost.
Similarly, if a client blindly assumes a default without trying to
figure it out, there is a similar loss of information.  In other words,
it is valuable to know that the content is uncertain.

Proposal: There is no default HTTP Content-Type.

If Content-Type is missing in the HTTP reply header, then the client should
assume that it was unknown to the server and should try to figure it out on
its own based on the path, and/or file content and/or context of the retrieval.

Blindly assuming anything ("text/plain" or "text/html") is worse than knowing
it is unknown.

The only ambiguity here is whether the server didn't know the Content-Type
or whether the server is broken and simply forgot to add the field.

We could add a new MIME type, "application/unknown" as the default and require
compliant httpd's to provide this and/or clients to assume it.  However,
provides no more information than if the Content-Type field is missing.

Subject: Two Webs?
content-length: 2245

I hope this doesn't come across as tactless or gossipy, since the involved
parties are here.

Are we seeing the beginnings of a rift in the WWW?  Recent developments (W3O,
the commercialization of Mosaic) have led me to wonder if there are two camps
out there, that are becoming increasingly polarized:
 - the CERN-ites, which probably includes most of the people on this list, who
   adhere to the traditional (open, PD) concept of the WWW and the internet and
   get offended any time someone implies that WWW=Mosaic.
   to these, commercialization is okay, but must adhere to consensus-adopted
   standards, such as HTML 3.0 and HTTP/2.  W3O is their new leadership, and
   I sometimes get the impression that some hold NCSA in about as high regard
   as Microsoft ("they got us where we are today, but we resent their
   popularity and arrogance").

 - the Mosaic-ites, which includes users that think that NCSA invented this
   whole thing and have never heard of Tim, and commercial developers who 
   prefer not to mention the acronym "WWW" when talking about their version of
   Mosaic.  To them, whatever NCSA says, goes.  This group has been further
   fractured by the formation of Marc A's company, and appears to be headed
   the same way as other commercial applications, with competing proprietary
   products.

My question is, is this bad?  Does it matter?  Is it even happening?

Now I probably shouldn't be throwing my unsubstantiated impressions out here in
the open, but I'd like to know if I'm wrong.  NCSA/Mosaic people, is your plan
to still conform to the standards developed here and by W3O?  Will your software
(commercial or public domain) be touted as a WWW product, or something entirely
different?  I know that Mosaic is a multi-protocol product, but HTML/HTTP is
still its heart.  Will W3O and the people on this list still try to support the
independent advances made by the NCSA and commercial Mosaic teams as with the
case of HTML 2.0?

The renaming of NCSA's Mosaic conference to "The Second International WWW
Conference-Mosaic and the Web" and its co-sponsorship by CERN is promising,
but why is NCSA not involved with W3O?  Or is it?

Flame away; I'd like to be wrong.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: SIGWEB for UK and Ireland
content-length: 3123

This article has been cross-posted, so apologies if you get more than one copy.
Also please forward this note as you wish, distribution is unlimited.

        A Special Interest Group for the United Kingdom and Ireland
                          on the World Wide Web

                                SIGWEB UK&I

This group was initially set up at the First International Conference on
the World Wide Web in Geneva in May.  The group was setup for researchers,
developers and maintainers in the British Isles, to allow for coordination
and communication.

At WWW94 there was a strong feeling of community and it is hoped that this
group can continue this.  Our aim is to bring together the web community in
the UK and allow people to share information.  We also intend to have
meetings in different parts of the country and possibly a Web conference.

Web server
There is a web server for the group, URL: http://www.qub.ac.uk/sigweb/index.html
This server contains much information about the web from technical
documents to how-to guides.  The server will act as a collation point for
resources produced in the UK, if you want to have material linked in mail
me at the address below.

Email List
An announcements based mailing list exists and is hosted at Loughbourgh
University of Technology, send mail to sigweb-request@lut.ac.uk, with
"subscribe sigweb" in the message body.  This mailing list is not meant to
be for discussion of the web, nor problem reports or questions, it exists
primarily to help with organising the group and providing a UK based
www-announce.  Note that if you just want more information you can send the
message "info sigweb" to the same address

Our Charter is below

Objectives

We aim to foster relationships between WWW researchers and developers from
academic and commercial environments in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The group aims to become a repository of W3 resources and a contact point
for web information.  The group will also maintain close contact with other
WWW related organisations.

Scope

The research and development issues related to WWW.  This includes the
evolution of http, html, server tools, user issues and other related areas.

Methods

A web page for general dissemination of information.  A searchable list
of members and research interests.  An email distribution list for
announcements.  Organisation of user group meetings and conferences
Distribution of reports to similiar groups outside UK and Ireland.

Membership

Anyone working in the UK or Ireland working in the area of WWW research
and development or support is invited to join this group.  They should
mail sigweb-request@lut.ac.uk with the message "subscribe sigweb"
in the message body, the subject is ignored.

The discussion continues to combine the questions of:

a) what should clients assume if the stream back from a HTTP GET
   doesn't contain a Content-Type: header, and

b) what should a server assume, in determining what Content-Type
   it should return, for files that it is serving.

These are certainly different questions: the first is important for
the design of the PROTOCOL while the second is important for the
design of a class of HTTP servers that implement the protocol.

The answer for (a) has to be the same for all servers/clients on the
network. The answer for (b) could easily vary for different
platforms, sets of documents, operating systems, etc.

That's what I thought at first.  It turns out that the "Date:" header
is very weakly defined in the RFCs and is likely to contain just about
anything from the date the document was created to the date it is sent
from the server.  In other words, if "Date:" were used consistently, I
would agree that what I have proposed is redundant.

I'm not sure that it would be safe to build on "Date:".  That's why I am
proposing a new header line with a very specific definition.

Nonsense -- most of the HTTP2 spec is defined "weakly" and yet the 
WWW seems to get along quite well.  The "Date:" header ALWAYS represents
the timestamp when the rfc822-type message was generated. 
If any software is using it to mean something else, then that software
is broken and must be fixed.  Period.

All HTTP servers that I know of follow this behavior consistently.
As far as I know, all cache managers do the same -- if they don't,
it is likely because they are a simple hack (i.e. saving the entire
message in a file rather than separating the headers from the content)
and such are not likely to be protocol-compliant to begin with.

It is far easier to fix the non-compliant servers (if there are any) than
it is to add to them a new "feature" which is, by definition, completely
redundant.  If the definition of "Date:" in the HTTP2 spec is weak, then
propose the specific wordage that will strengthen the definition.  I am
sure that, if the definition is accurate, it will be added to the HTTP2
spec (the people at CERN are always willing to improve the WWW
documentation ... they just rarely have the time to do it themselves).

                     Announcing the Release of
                   EINet MacWeb Version 1.00Alpha2


RELEASE INFO
MCC's EINet group is pleased to announce MacWeb Version 1.00Alpha2.
MacWeb is a full-featured World-Wide-Web, hypertext  browser. It is
available as freeware from the URL:

    ftp://ftp.einet.net/einet/mac/macweb/macweb.latest.sea.hqx

MacWeb is also available via anonymous FTP from the machine
ftp.einet.net.  Change (cd) to the directory /einet/mac/macweb and get
the following file:

                  macweb.latest.sea.hqx

MacWeb requires that your Macintosh be configured with System 7
and MacTCP 2.0.2 (MacTCP 2.0.4 recommended).

PROBLEMS AND COMMENTS
To report problems, suggest enhancements, or send general comments
about MacWeb, please send email to macweb@einet.net.

DESCRIPTION
MacWeb is a World Wide Web client which uses hypertext, or hypermedia
where references within a document are links which lead users to other
documents, lists, resources or actions.  The World Wide Web supports
the display of text, graphics, sound, and video.  It is also a tool
through which Internet users can access information using from various
other Internet front ends, navigators, information, services, and
resources.

FEATURES SUPPORTED
Some of MacWeb's new features include:

1.  New Features *Unique* To MacWeb

    o "LinkOps" Menu
      Have you ever wanted to copy a URL that appears in the status line?
      MacWeb now gives you this capability!  Simply press _and hold_ on a link.
      You'll be presented with a menu containing the following options:

        o Retrieve and Display
        o Retrieve to Disk
        o View MIME Info
        o View Suffix Info
        o View Source
        o Copy URL to Clip

    o New Hotlist Capabilities
      MacWeb can now sort hotlists (by menu string or URL) and save them
      in two additional formats:  MacMosaic and HTML.  (Yes, that means you
      can now read _and write_ MacMosaic hotlists!  You can also export your
      hotlists as HTML!)

2.  Other New Features

    o "Helper" Application GUIs
      MacWeb now gives you point and click interfaces for editing "Helper"
      application bindings.  This includes both MIME Type to "Helper" and File
      Suffix to MIME Type mapping GUIs.

    o CERN Proxy Support
      MacWeb supports the CERN Proxy protocol.  (Until the GUI is complete,
      you must edit the Proxy info with ResEdit.)

    o Faster Image Loading
      Thanks in part to some updated GIF decoding code from David Koblas,
      MacWeb now inlines GIF images 2-3x faster.

    o Relative Sizes in Styles
      MacWeb now allows Styles to be defined with <em>relative</em> sizes.
      For example, a level 1 Header (H1) is defined with a relative size of +6
      whereas a level 6 Header (H6) is defined with a relative size of -2.  An
      entire document can now be resized by simply changing the size of the
"Root"
      element.  All relatively sized elements (e.g., Headers) adjust
accordingly!

    o NNTP Support
      You can now read NetNews with MacWeb!

    o Other Nice Features

        o VMS FTP Support
          Peruse VMS-based ftp sites with MacWeb.

        o Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown Keys Work
          Use your favorite extended keyboard navigation keys with MacWeb.

        o More Status Messages
          See more status information as MacWeb negotiates the various
protocols.

        o Configure MacWeb with a _Default_ Hotlist
          Simply copy a MacWeb Hotlist Resource into MacWeb and it will become
          the default Hotlist.

        o Search Dialog Now Retains Last Value

I just watched the behaviour of a caching CERN server.  It does, in
fact, do as you say.  The "Date: " line indicates when the item came
from the cache and the "Last-Modified: " line indicates the date of
"publication."

And I also took a look at RFC822.  It is very vague about how the
Date: line is to be used.

So, if you so strongly disagree that a "snapshot-date: " line is
identical in semantics to the existing "Date: " line, then it would be
wise to write that down in the http specification.  Otherwise somone will
do it differently.

I would prefer to avoid the uncertainty and define something new that is
not ambiguous and does not have a long history of prior use.

"protocol-complient" with a "weak spec" is kind of an oxymoron. :-)

Adding a comment to the protocol spec would be fine by me.

To try and get some sort of closure on this issue:


How's about: All HTTP/1.0 Responses whose non-header portion is non-empty must 
include a Content-Type field. HTTP/0.9 reponses should be considered untyped, and
type inference is the responsibility of the client. 

That seems to cover current practice though it can be defeated by degenerate CGI and
BGI modules.

This may or may not answer the question you're asking.

I met in person with the Mosaic people (the people at NCSA now) last 
month and _they_ appear to be very commited to the open standards 
process.

I request that this thread not be followed.

Brandon - when you wrote  "Now I probably
shouldn't be throwing my unsubstantiated impressions out here in
the open..."  you were right.  Asking those questions in
the way you did was a bad idea for three reasons

  1) They aren't technical, and www-talk is for technical discussions

  2) They are flame-bait.  We don't need flaming, we really don't.
A mailing list is just not the right place to have such discussions.
A bar or a coffeehouse is much better.

  3) The questions are useless, because there's nothing useful you
could do with the answer. Suppose someone from NCSA has answered that
they planned to merge with Microsoft.  Or with the NSA for that matter.
Could you stop them?  No.  This isn't a democracy.  It isn't
even a standards committee. So there's no point in even asking someone
what they plan to do. 

  What matters is to make good designs,  implement them, criticise them
and improve them.  And do it quickly.

Please, all, let us use www-talk to advance the technology,
not argue politics or commercialization.

Please don't reply to this letter.  Especially if all you know is
rumour or opinion.  If it makes you mad, flame me behind my back.

  And I beg your indulgence and ask you to assume that this, like 
most other net mail, was written
  with best wishes,
jim

Well I hope you are wrong too. However, I suspect you mightn't be. For
some time now the "CERN-ites" have been trying to give the web some shape,
to solve some of its more fundamental problems. However, some other
parties/communities have been pushing for extensions that facilitate
commerce, etc. Both have perfectly legitimate concerns of course.

I admit to being a "CERN-ite" since I believe that the web is suffering from
some serious fundamental deficiencies. However, I do see the point of
the others.

I think that it is a bad idea to "bolt on" extensions simply to
satisfy certain user communities, when the basic protocols are far from
robust. Therefore, it is my hope that the "Mosaic-ites" (for want of a
better term) will back down to some extent.

I think that you can't just lump all the non-CERN-ites into one group
though. Things are a bit more complex than that.

Just my opinion :-)

It's clear that there is no default content type for HTTP/1.0 in practice.

[Not that it's much of an issue, but HTTP/0.9 always returns HTML or
plain text, and it signals plain text with <PLAINTEXT>. Perhaps that's
not how it works in practice, but that's how it originally worked. ]

As for the HTTP/1.0 protocol: I'd say:

	An HTTP server must specify the content type of the response
	data. There is no default.

	NOTE: HTTP clients should be aware that some HTTP servers fail
	to supply a content type, and they should do some reasonable
	error handling (or guessing of the content type) in this case.

About the suggestion that the server return untyped data: that doesn't
play nicely with the format negociation algorithm. If a server can't
determine the type of some data, it shouldn't ship it to the client at
all. Note that it's reasonable to ship any data under the
"application/octet-stream" content-type, if the client Accept:s it.

What happens if the set of content-types Accept:ed by the client and
the set of content-types that a server can supply an object in don't
intersect? Is there an HTTP result code for "I don't have that object
in any format that you accept"?

I realize that every HTTP client must support text/html and text/plain,
but must every object be available as one of those? What about images?

I believe "application/octet-stream" does not differ in any meaningful
way from "application/unknown".  If a server really doesn't have any
idea what a file is, that's a perfectly suitable tag for it.

By the way, one thing I never saw was whether the message without any
"Content-Type" had a "MIME-Version" header.  If there is a
MIME-Version header, I really think we should try to stick with the
specified behavior of MIME (defaulting to text/plain;
charset=us-ascii) unless there is some overwhelming reason not to.  If
there is no MIME-Version header, we effectively have the same
situation as HTTP/0.9 and so the body could be anything.

There is no inherent connection between HTTP and HTML, and no reasons
to assume that the Web community might not choose to replace one of
them but not the other at some point in the future.  They should no be
bound together so strongly.

I too have spotted a little fraying on the web and this is of *grave*
concern to me.  Once a crack develops it is very difficult to repair. 
There are, in theory, twenty million or so of us and my experience leads me
to believe that orchestrating that many people is virtually (sic)
impossible.  If a crack exists then I suspect that people are falling into
it at the rate of tens every minute.  Now, am *I* being paranoid?

No.  I use the NCSA server.

No.  I use lynx.

>My question is, is this bad?  Does it matter?  Is it even happening?

My two "no's" show that you make a not unreasonable but fundamental
mistake.  I have no intention of following *anything* other then W3O
conventions and reccomendations.  My concern is the size of the web.  The
bigger the better and so two webs is, for me, an unmitigated disaster.  If
the NCSA conference diverges from W3O then that is *terrible* for all of
us.  Browsers immediately double in size!

>Now I probably shouldn't be throwing my unsubstantiated impressions ...

Well, as long as you know that NCSA/Mosaic is not a tablet of stone but
their server is robust and easy.  I spent two weeks trying to put up the
CERN server.  I had to substantially rebuild the "make" and gave up when
Rob McCool told me about the NCSA server and it went up a treat.  As a new
unix user (six months ago) the CERN server tauught me more than anything so
far ... Put me down as NCSA/Lynx/W3O. ;)

>The renaming of NCSA's Mosaic conference to "The Second International WWW
>Conference-Mosaic and the Web" and its co-sponsorship by CERN is promising,

I don't know.  They ought to be.  I like to think of CERN as the spider's
lair but she has a mate and some children (hoohoo.ncsa.. ).  Are they
getting divorced - will she eat him like the real thing - will he eat her
and turn the whole arachnid world upside down ...

	As for the HTTP/1.0 protocol: I'd say:
        An HTTP server must specify the content type of the response
        data. There is no default.
 
This is more or less what I said, except that I allowed for Content-Type to 
be ommitted if there is no response data.

In practice HTTP/0.9 result streams are untyped at the HTTP level. Client 
pick their own types. Attempting to retroactively change reality by fiat is 
silly. Now, changing reality by citroen is much more sensible.

>Flame away; I'd like to be wrong.

Good, because I believe you are.  Sorry, no flame though...

Everything I know about the scene *before* the mass exodus to Mountain View
is hearsay or history, but here's my view of the situation *now*:
                                  ^^^^^^^

1.  NCSA's people definitely have a cooperative posture.  I believe they
        want to participate in the standards process just like everyone
        else.

2.  I'm a commercial developer of Mosaic, and I mention the word WWW all
        the time.  I always credit TimBL/CERN with the invention of
        the Web.  I do not tout the WWW=Mosaic philosophy (and neither
        does NCSA as far as I can see.)

3.  It is NOT true that "to [Spyglass], whatever NCSA says, goes".  We
        have a strong working partnership with NCSA.  We
        also want to have strong ties to the other WWW players.  Our
        belief in the importance of group consensus is very strong.

>Now I probably shouldn't be throwing my unsubstantiated impressions out here in
>the open, ...

I'd probably agree.

>NCSA/Mosaic people, is your plan
>to still conform to the standards developed here and by W3O?

Yes.  Of course, in addition to trying to adhere to the group
adopted standards, we'd also like to participate as members of
said group. :-)

>Will your software
>(commercial or public domain) be touted as a WWW product, or something entirely
>different?

What else would be call it?  Mosaic *is* a WWW application.

[ Looking back on this message, it looks like I'm speaking for almost
everyone.  Just to be clear -- this message gives MY perspective, MY
opinions, and nothing more.  I'm not speaking *for* NCSA, Spyglass, or
CERN.  Rather, I'm speaking, from my own viewpoint, *about* NCSA, Spyglass,
and CERN.]

I have set up a Cern proxy server (pre-6) and I am using both Mosaic
for Windows and X-Mosaic on a DEC Alpha.  The problem is that the 
ftp part of the proxy seems to work for the X-Mosaic but not the 
Mosaic for Windows.  I have tested it with Mosaic for windows Version
2 alpha 2 and version 2 alpha 5 with the same result.  I have tested
it with Novell, DEC TCP/IP, and Trumpet, all with the same result.
I have rechecked my Mosaic.ini file and all seems to be set right.
If anyone has some suggestions I would appreciate it.

I sympathesize with people wanting to keep this discussion technical.

However, the last four or five years it seems that many "decisions" or
directions in the "computing world" are not made on the basis of technical 
information and indeed fly into the face of good technical information
and sound technical advice and procedures.  So, as long as political or
commercial trends have the ability to have this impact on the work of 
professionals dealing with technical information and giving technical advice, 
perhaps it is good for such people to be aware of the context in which 
they are operating.

That being said:  is there a separate list for discussing the kind of
question which was raised by Brandon Plewe for those of us who like

It's hard to come out and say this, but Lynx does Accept: */*, assuming
that the user wants the data from any request.  The user is promted wether
or not the data should be downloaded if not displayable.  Correct content
handling for a client?  Maybe not.

Further, if we move clients away from doing this type of thing, then 
should a client be asking for the head and then ask if the user wants the 
data before a full transaction?  If so, shouldn't the mechanism be in libwww?

	Trying to keep the talk technical ... 
 
	I think the consensus agrees that the web is more than just 
HTTP, more then just Mosaic, Lynx, and friends,  more then just HTML. 
I mentioned an app I call  'webcat'.   This is a generic  "go fetch it" 
tool for retrieving  (and storing?)  any URL-specifiable object.

	Webcat has only existed for a couple of months,  so I don't 
know if I've ever had it hit on an HTTP/0.9 server.   It *does* use 
the simplest GET,  not HTTP/1.0.   But ... 
 
	If what I want to do is grab some C source,  I certainly 
won't want that "<PLAINTEXT>" at the start!   So if it's  "plain text", 
I don't want SGML thrown in purely for the sake of some viewer. 
I want the plain text object sent as CR/LF text across the wire. 
I just might want to do something with this object OTHER THAN view it. 
 
	If webcat were up to HTTP/1.0,  then this potential problem 
might never surface.   (so far,  I guess I've just been lucky) 
Webcat knows about two kinds of objects:  plain text and binary. 
If some viewer/browser were to read a file that had been retrieved by 
webcat,  it would probably be a plain text object and the viewer would 
have to make some sensible determination based on the presense,  or lack, 
of <html>, <!DOCTYPE...>, etc.   No?   This is what happens if you run 
one of these browsers on a local file.   This to me suggests that viewers 
have a little more smarts,  not just rely on defaults and HTTP headers.

	I think this thread started because certain client(s) 
apparently don't make  "the right"  assumption in this case.   It's been 
suggested that that's a different issue,  not a protocol problem.

	I'm kinda thinking that there should be.   But if there is, 
I don't want it to wind-up in the main stream.   Ie:  I don't want the 
error message (text/html) where I expected a GIF (image/gif). 
(argument for fixing my app,  I'm sure)

Eric's non-flame is exactly what I wanted to see.  I wasn't trying to say
that everyone who uses Mosaic or NCSA HTTPD is evil (I still think Mosaic/X is
the best all-around browser out there), just that some users, some server
maintainers, and some developers (thankfully, not NCSA itself or Eric) have a 
tendency to overemphasize NCSA's (or Mosaic's) role and underemphasize the
efforts of CERN, W3O, and the rest of us here; either ignorantly or
purposefully.  As far as I can see, this tendency seems to be increasing.

I'm sorry if my post didn't belong here.  I thought this list dealt with the
conceptual future of the Web as well as technical implementation issues.

Doesn't it?

[Snicker]  I would certainly think so.  The general topic of your post
wasn't really all that inappropriate -- it just had significant potential
to catch fire.

I thought this was important enough to get an opinion from someone who
really *can* speak on behalf of Spyglass:

-- cut here --

Spyglass has been looking at the WWW as an open-systems, standards-based,
group effort from the start.  We have seen the *perceived* split between
"CERN-ites" and "Mosaic-ites" (to use Brandon's terms), but the future is
shaped far more by what these two groups agree on than their differences.

We recognize that the two umbrella terms are "WWW" and "Mosaic".  Our
product has the name Mosaic, licensed from NCSA.  Our product is a WWW
browser.  We use both, but the press tends to pick one term or the other.
That ends up being their choice.

Spyglass is participating in the following standards efforts:

- HTML 2.0 and follow-ons, including the proposed IETF working group to
formalize it. (NCSA, too)  We will meet the HTML 2.0 spec upon its release.

- W3O, at least as soon as we find out what it is.  The initial signs from
Tim Berners-Lee and MIT are promising.  Our goal is to see the reference
code standard gel and get redistributed on a regular, predictable plan.  We
also want to contribute code to the reference standard, subject to
consortium review.

- We use CERN-libwww-derived code for our development.

- WWW and WWW/Mosiac conferences, whatever they are called.

In addition, we would like to be part of standards efforts which address
security, transaction mechanisms, and billing.  So far, we have collected
information on Secure-HTTP, Shen, and others.


Working closely with NCSA has not precluded any of these efforts, in fact
it has helped.  Spyglass needs both Mosaic and the standarization of the
WWW protocols to be successful.

Whatever choice a developer or team makes regarding their project is, of 
course, their decision.

To continue compatibility with the WWW is paramount, if they are to be a 
WWW client.

All that needs to be done is adhere to the protocols used by the WWW in a 
client, or send correct messages back from a server, to maintian this 
compatibility.

The most important advantages to keeping all developers using the same 
common code is that it enforces compatibility, allows new developments to 
be shared by all using the common code, and provides a standard API.

If an organization can stay compatible through their own devices, then so 
be it.  They should cause none of us worry.  Even if they decide to 
enhance their products to meet their own ends, they will do it in a manner 
compatible with the Web, or they will split but keep their WWW 
compatibility intact.  No other WWW products need worry about their 
"split" for normality.  If the split is a healthy one, then perhaps the 
WWW will eventually encompass this split.  Note that such splits are not 
immediately standardized; your client should still work, regardless.

No, they don't double in size.  They use a consistant protocol; 
regardless of what server they are talking to; regardless of how the
server/client was implemented.  Do you know how many different flavors of
SMTP, FTP, NNTP, HTTP, etc... servers there are out there?  Do you think
that they all use the same common code base for the specific type of
server?  Do you think any of the implementations use different protocols
for the specific type of server? 

No. No. No.  How do you think we cope with each unique server?  Surely by 
not hardcoding the compatibility in for each one.  A protocol definition 
is used.

If an organization produces their own protocol, it is not HTTP as we call
it, and the WWW community doesn't have a need to squabble over such an 
event, as it is not WWW.

Sounds perfectly reasonable to me! If a client has disk space to
store the data into, then by all means, accept */* and allow the
user to deal with the problem offline.

If you're running in -anonymous or "kiosk" mode through a public
telnet port, however, and the server has an MPEG video, there's
no use in having it pump the data all the way across the net so
you can put it in the bitbucket (or the "black hole," as it's
called in the libwww code.)

Ack! Blech! Barf! Please don't subvert the whole format negociation
paradigm!

On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with providing a "link preview"
feature, where the user ctrl-clicks on an anchor, the client does
a HEAD, and displays info about availability, size, formats, languages,
etc.

The format negociation's greatest feature is that it requires exactly
ONE round trip for any GET request.

You have it completely the wrong way round. The whole purpose of W3O is to
ensure that there is one standard. The problem up until now has been that the
standards have been decided by the first person to get code out the door more
than careful consideration.

This did not happen because people were actively trying to break things. It
happened because we did not have the resources to coordinate things. We did
not have enough people to keep libwww up to date with all the various changes
made outside. The code base diverged. This is being rectified at the moment.
There is no point in four separate libraries being deveoped using the same
technology.

The NCSA conference was proposed before W3O was set up. Its not suprising 
therefore that they did not anticipate the W3o world view - whatever that
might turn out to be. W3O does not even officially exist yet.

The server was a complete mess until Ari sorted it out. Now it seems pretty

Its a bit difficult for anyone to be involved at the moment because W3O
exists only as a domain name w3.org. I don't think that there has been 
any announcement about who is taking part except for MIT and CERN who are
going to give it house room.


As for beating up on Microsoft and the NSA, both are quite wellcome to join
as far as I am concerned. You can hardly be an open standards organisation
and then try to keep them out. In fact given some of the objectives set
for W3O we would be damn fools to try to do it without listening to what
the NSA have to say in particular because they set some pretty important
standards.

I was wondering how long it would take for this discussion to roll around
to the question it begs -- what is the Web?  It has thus rolled and I agree
that the Web is much more than HTTP, since the clients and servers
integrate other tools.  The Web wouldn't be so interesting were it not for
that capability.  The definition above suggests that the Web is
standardized by URLs.  That makes the URL standard verrrry important.

This is a very important debate because it makes implications about whether
or not there is a default navigational paradigm.  If the Web were defined
by HTTP, then the default would implicitly be hypertext... except that with
its foray into forms, HTTP has expanded beyond "straight" hypertext into
the world of fields, menus and buttons and thus into GUIs, QBE, etc.  This
seems to have been done largely because the servers have been integrated
with databases, for which the default paradigm is fields, buttons, menus,
etc.  The browsers integrate. Gopher, ftp and news, which have a default
paradigm of hierarchical browsing.  Actually, however, I think this may
reflect that HTTP has grown beyond its name, not that it's taking a wrong
direction.

I don't want to get into a taxonomy of navigational design paradigms here.
I'd like to suggest that one of the great strengths of the Web is that
through a single user interface (yet at the same time, with many choices
for that single one), a variety of navigational paradigms can be
integrated.  This is a truly wonderful thing, I suspect.  For a variety of
users and a variety of tasks, a variety of paradigms are essential.
Without really much work or programming talent, I've been able to wire
together a server that incorporates hierarchical, hypertext, full-text
search, and indexed navigational paradigms.

I could have done this before, in fact I did, but each paradigm required a
different software tool.  I used a database, AppleScript, HyperCard, a
full-text engine, word processors, page layout tools and the Macintosh file
structure.  It was nothing that anyone else could really understand except
in pieces.  The Web thus is not only lovely from a production and
maintenance standpoint (now that I've built tools for those purposes), it's
a million times easier for users to grasp and use, cross-platform.

And I know that I can add graphical, time-line and other navigational
paradigms to the server, again without having to spend a lot of time and
without really learning C, which I resist at every turn, though it's harder
every day.

I think of the Web as a standard way to "package" distributed information
from hetereogeneous sources for navigability.  What are the implications
for HTTP if we look at  HTML as just one of a number of information
navigation/packaging standards of equal importance?  Perhaps we're defining
a compound document architecture, but that's what a Web page resembles,
anyway.

Here's the question that's really nagging me.  Do we really intend for the
HTTP to become the means by which information from heterogeneous sources
becomes integrated?  For example, When browsers speak SQL, will it make
sense to talk to a database through the Web and a CGI application?  Or will
the URL architecture encourage browser developers to bypass HTTP?

I'm interested in practical responses.  For example, although browsers
speak NNTP, there are some compelling reasons to use HTTP to deliver news
(primarily integration reasons), even though it's theoretically less
efficient to add the extra layer of processing.

If it doesn't, I don't!

I just posted a long piece on this basic subject, but I'll toss in my glib
one, too.  If HTTP *is* the Web, then there are already a bunch of Webs,
given that the browsers support Gopher, ftp, news, mailto, etc.

My other message contains my positive comments... ;-)

(RPG - I'm cc'ing you coz I saw your post on c.i.www about this and 
want to bring this topic to this forum)

Okay, gang, I've looked EVERYWHERE I could, I've been on www-talk for the 
past 8 months and I've gone to the web conference in Geneva, and yet this 
topic eludes my research into its current status.

The problem:  we need to bring back group and public annotation BACK to 
the WWW.

Annotation is a meme that has been around since day 1, as far as I can 
tell.  It was in NCSA's early server and browser, but they removed it
as I suppose there were other things they wanted to get working fine 
first.  (Don't blame that, I guess).  Support for user annotations is
still in Mosaic, but I don't think it was ever implemented in any other 
browsers.  

I found *some* documentation on NCSA's server about annotation, but no
implementation details or underlying structure.  I figured it was tied into
the PUT method, but I haven't been able to find much on that either (I looked
around CERN's server too).  It's so frustrating because the interface is
*almost* there in NCSA's Xmosaic, it's just the "group" and "public" option
is greyed out! :)

For Wired's new online publishing effort launching in September, I am writing
a collection of CGI scripts and forms, essentially an extension of WIT, that
will allow users to give feedback on any document on our site, and for vines
of discussions to cascade from that feedback, also implementing a peer-review
system which will make navigating the feedback and finding useful commentary
easier. It'll be something like WIT, but structured differently.  I believe
commentary functionality should be built into the client and server, the way
it is in X Mosaic, and that the PUT method should be enhanced and solidified,
instead of trying to kludge this as CGI scripts and forms.  It should also
thus be standardized across servers so we don't have to relearn
administration details for this for a different client, and so that
subprograms can work together.  Part of implementing this involves a huge
database of users with posting authority, and writing tools to manage that
database and the verification issue.  

So far I've been planning on doing this through the CGI/forms interface,
but I want to do it the RIGHT way, which would be annotation as 
implemented in the Mosaic browsers and using PUT.  I also would want to
work with the WWW community on this project, because there are others who 
seem to be interested in this as well.  I also don't have a problem with
putting the work I do in the public domain.

I am working on a spec for the system and a layout of the different 
scripts and directory/file systems.  What I want to know now is, is
this a topic we should keep discussing here, or is the body of people 
interested in working on this sufficiently small enough that we could 
break up amongst ourselves and create a sublist. 

This is also a call for information.  If someone could point me towards 
documentation for the PUT method and for any more info about implementing 
annotation, let me know.

I am here to tell you that (as Eric said), I do not perceive NCSA breaking
away.  NCSA depends on the open and collaborative definitions of the current
protocols.  (i.e. We are currently making revisions to support HTML 2.0)

I hope not - what would motivate the negative attitudes?  There is no
"what NCSA says" for the "Mosaic-ites" to follow.

The conference was originally designed to be an introduction to Mosaic,
with tech-support-like workshops.  It was not designed to compete with the
Geneva conference and propose competing standards.  I'm not involved in
any of the planning, but it sounds like it will be a bit broader now.

I'm not aware of W3O doing anything yet, but NCSA will be involved
in the standards discussed there as soon as we hear about it.

I think the comments by Eric and Tim from Spyglass, and Chris from Spry
should also help a great deal in clarifying this issue.

this is things as I see them,

> The problem:  we need to bring back group and public annotation BACK to

yes, i agree.  we've recently started developing a feedback mechanism
for Global Network Navigator (GNN).  initially, we implemented it as
a one-time evaluation form for a particular article.  we've since
generalized it to be used in other places within GNN, and we'd like
to make it even more general.

it works in an extremely simple manner -- the user fills out a form,
whose contents are then stored in a simple database on our server.
GNN staff can look at the entire set of comments, or extract a set
and publish them.

for an example, see:

  Multi-level Marketing Schemes
  http://www.digital.com/gnn/meta/finance/feat/pyramid.html

now, having said that i support annotation, we've found that simply
putting up a generic `comment' form doesn't work as well as tailoring
the form to the particular context.  for the above example, we received 
a lot of replies that, frankly, i don't think we would have received 
if people had simply annoted the document.  perhaps this has to do with 
user knowledge of annotation (i.e., since it doesn't work now, no one 
would bother doing it), but i think it might have more to do with the
fact that at the end of our article, we specifically invite our readers
to comment on the article; the form is also tailored to the context.

if anyone else has implemented similar reader-evaluation or
mock-annotation (to coin a term), perhaps they could share their
experiences?

brian, if you decide to move this to a smaller discussion list, please
keep me in the loop.

I agree with Nick's point about integrating different tools, and the
web seems to be the right place to do this.

Apropos of which, it would be a big help if the clients could
implement a better ftp interface, including multiple gets of some
kind. 

And to access gophers, compatibility with gopher+ would be useful.

John and Brian,

After lurking here in the shadows awhile, I finally stumble on a subject
dear to my heart.  I am sole tech writer for a team in the FAA that
develops and maintains software that calculates instrument approach
procedures for airports.  I am converting all our documentation to online
using HTML and Mosaic on an SGI Indigo2 network.

The developers and users of the system consist of 3 groups:  programmers,
spec writers, and endusers.  They all see documents, attend meetings, work
on projects and need a more efficient annotation system when viewing meeting
notes and other documents.  I designed (however dangerous) script that
captured the form input and appended it to the same file containing the form,
formatted the text and redisplayed it.  To do this, of course, the file had
to have full permissions to the world and had potential for failure.  Our
group was small enough and knowledgeable enough to use it properly and it
worked quite well.

I would love to get my hands on something that made annotating a simpler
process for groups.  Please keep me informed of developments if possible.

The basic problem with annotation as it was implemented is that it
didn't allow any inline annotations. The annotations weren't very
useful except on the shortest of documents.

If you want to reintroduce annotations, perhaps that's the most
important issue to resolve.

Before I start I admit to having only skim-read a lot of the debate, so
sorry if I go over points that have been picked up incorrectly (Im not
up to reading 1000+ lines of email this early, well 10am, in the day :)

I must say a sort of thanks to Brandon for bringing this whole topic up.
Its something that I had been wondering about for a while. Anyway the
key points I picked up on:

1) The WWW is bigger than any single client or protocol. 
--------------------------------------------------------
Okay this is probably stating the obvious. But thats always a good place
to start. I think that the WWW depends on this nature to form the web in
the 1st place. Having had long discussions with Garrett over recent
weeks about the future of Lynx, and indeed the WWW, I come to see more
and more that one of 2 possibilities are going to occur.

    A) A line will have to be drawn at what protocols are allowed within
       the WWW. I could start by listing the main ones (http, nntp,
       gopher, ftp, nfs/rfs (via file) etc etc) but you also get some of
       the more obscure ones such as LDAP and possibly CLDAP when it
       arrives that people like INRA are pushing for.

    B) People will just keep on adding protocols to the list and the
       client size will just keep expanding. Again as Garrett said I
       believe this wont increase the size of the clients /that/ much
       but it will result in a larger source tree and hence source
       complexity. What then? Will I be able to read/send mail from
       Mosaic (okay so I dont like mailto being broken in Mosaic and yes
       I have told NCSA :). Will the clients end up as being the only
       window you ever need open on your desktop? Where then?

2) What is W30
--------------
Im sure I missed this. Where was the "introduction" to W30 placed? 

3) Statements from various companies
------------------------------------
One very positive thing that has arisen from all of this is the comments
from people like Spry and NCSA (sorry forgotten the other one) that
they are committed to the way that THIS GROUP is pushing the WWW. My
Electronic Design Methods lecturer always used to talk about technology
pull and application push. Im sure that there is a lesson to be learnt
here from this. The question is are we going to create a technology and
pull the WWW along (which I think is the way to go), or are we going to
let Mosaic, Lynx et al push us to making decisions?

I must admit to being very encouraged by the seemingly unanimous
decisions from the "mosaic-ites" that HTML2.0 and HTML3.[01] are the way
to go. That is always a good start.

Anyway enough from me, Im really only reitterating what other people are
saying. But I do think that this is a valid discussion, since I think it
enables us to get out into the open the direction that we think that the
WWW should be heading.

Sorry this is all a bit disjointed. I really need to wake up :)

Agreed.  What do you guys feel are the pros & problems of WIT? A good place to  
start? How are / would you do things differently?

Subject: CD-based URL-resolving question 
content-length: 923

Hi all!

This may be a silly question (and maybe misplaced, sorry!) but:

I plan to create a multi-platform-CD (ISO9660) with oceanographic data presentedby different WWW-browsers on different operating systems
(Sun OS 4.1.3, Mac, MS-Windows, maybe more!).
 
I don't want to create several distributions for each OS, they all should use
ONE representation.

But if the filenames in the URL are longer than 8 characters AND 
quite similar (i.e. having 'long' common prefixes), HOW they are
resolved right?  How does WinMosaic for example resolve
the RIGHT LOCAL URL for a document?

e.g.: file://localhost/DIRNAME/Plates10_35.200m.html
      file://localhost/DIRNAME/Plates10_35.2000m.html

If these files are located on a CD, how are they saved on it logical?
I think, in MS-DOS-terms these two DIFFERENT filenames would be mapped on the
same "\DIRNAME\PLATES10.HTM" file, aren't they?

Thanks

I'll put my hand up for volunteering, Brian.  I've been working on the
same thing in python, and just yesterday began wondering who (if anyone)
was doing anything with PUT.  And have noted how kludgey it is handling
the whole thing with CGI. 

I think it would be best to go offline with this, get something together, 
and then bring it back to the list.

And I can't help but to think that the recent discussions about how to 
get consensus on HTML 2.0, on group consensus and moving libwww/HTTPx 
forward, etc. all certainly point to a great need within our community to 
track things in a way other than mailing lists.

I am not sure how this would work. 

Maybe I am not seeing the paradigm correctly.  When I think of group and
public annotations, I think of the system described in Eric Drexler's book,
The Engines of Creation.  He has a chapter devoted to a free-form hypertext
system, which he believes would greatly accelerate the advance of science
by greatly accelerating the discussion of ideas.  

In his paradigm, anyone could make a hypertext link at any point in any 
document.  This link would point you to an annotation; itself subject to being 
annotated.  Since all such links would have the creator's digital "signature",
you could set the browser to discount links from some people and emphasize 
others.  I guess you could call this a "Bozo filter".  

In his view, this whole thing is a store and forward system. It depends on a 
nano-tech storage system, so everyone would keep a complete copy of the Web 
with them at all times.  Each Web module could plug into any other and upload
and download new links to other module.

Of course, this last idea is a bit fanciful, (if not impossible? What kind of
bandwidth would be needed to download the entire Web in a few seconds?), but
everything before that sounds like the Web we Know and Love today.  So, am I 
missing the boat on this discussion, or am I on the right track?  Exactly 
how are group and public annotations being proposed to work?  Do I have an
obligation to accept annotations?  Do I have to accept links or actually 
provide storage to annotations themselves?  Perhaps there needs to be a 
distinguishing characteristic to an anchor added by someone other than the 
original author of a document, to alert the reader that he/she is leaving 
the flow of the document and are off on commentary.  Otherwose you could 
find yourself forever wandering around without getting the info you want.

Hi again,

Quick question. I have an application that is a gateway. This binds on
demand to another service. However its not always guarenteed that this
bind will be succesful, so there are occasions when no information can
be retrieved, which may only last a number of minutes.

What is the correct error code to send in this case. Im using 500 at the
moment since its an implementation error. I discounted 404 since if the
bind was successful information could be found. I also discounted 403
since although that was closer it still isnt right. 

Any ideas? Or do we need another one. 

Ive also put this on WWW-proxy (although I guess most if not all on
www-proxy are on www-talk :) since its a similar situation to there.
What error does the CERN pre 6 return when it cant contact the remote
site? Its a very similar situation I believe.

I would suggest something like:

406 Service Temporarily Unavaliable

I know its yet another status code but its sometimes is quite hard to
map errors onto the current set.

There was a discussion here a while back about "broadcast documents" (I 
think that's the right term).  Ones that need to replicate.  I think it 
was in reference to the scalability of WIT.

One group wanted to consider using NNTP as a means to update HTTP 
servers.  Now there is the concept in the proxy list I think of cache 
managers.  Confession, we are also a Lotus Notes shop.  And I think it 
provides an excellent example of many of the things needed to make HTTP 
into a robust collaborative environment (signature/encryption, versioning 
of documents, server-server replication).

So, to paraphrase: no, it won't be a single image forwarded around the 
net.  Perhaps the proxy cache manager could do it: you update its image, 
and he propagates the *changes* up or around to other subscribing cache 
managers.

I have to wonder whether the PUT method is the right one to be thinking about
for annotations.

Aren't annotations *new* subordinates of the main document?  If so, the
PUT method is the wrong one to be using (do we really want everyone to
be able to edit and re-write the original article?).

According to my copy of the HTTP Internet draft (5 Nov 1993 - so may be out
of date by now),
  "POST and REPLY should be used for creating new documents"

(Couldn't find any information on REPLY :-(


Shouldn't we be looking at POST and REPLY???

I would like to be informed, too.

My solution to the problem (globally viewable annotations for a reference 
document repository) (which is wedged in my neurons at the moment rather 
than on-disk) is to access the annotations through a CGI script.  For 
example, if we have the hypothetical URL:
     http://www.indy.tce.com/ctm/mlf1/netbios.txt
for a document, the annotations would be accessed via:
     http://www.indy.tce.com/cgi-bin/ctm_anno/mlf1/netbios.txt
where "/mlf1/netbios.txt" is the PATH_EXTRA for the CGI script.  (The TCE 
Corporate Technical Memory is the name for our internal repository.)  It 
would on-the-fly gather all the annotation files (formatted in text/plain 
and text/html), producing output with each annotation preceded by the author 
and date of the annotation like so:
     Mike Gideon, Thu Apr 14 02:04:09 EST 1994
     This is great!  It helped me get CAPS running as well as Lotus Notes!

     Elaine Cordwainer, Tue Jul  5 06:45:33 EST 1994
     Since we are switching to WfWG 3.11, isn't a document on how to
     increase the # of real-mode NetBIOS sessions obsolete?

The annotations would be submitted via FTP or NFS to a spool directory on 
the Web server (in a form like that of the old UNIX v7 lpr daemon) where 
from the daemon moves them to their proper place.  Annotations would be 
found directly in:
     http://www.indy.tce.com/ctm/mlf1/netbios.txt.anno
with URLs like:
     http://www.indy.tce.com/ctm/mlf1/netbios.txt.anno/mg4.940414020409
(for the first annotation above).  This spooling method is the same as what 
we use for document submissions now.

I hope this helps.

Brian:

Thanks for lighting a fire under this topic.  We've been talking about this issue
here at Cornell for a few months.  An annotation system with various levels of
protection/authorization would be a big leap in the functionality of the Web. 
Already we've seen forms move the web from simply a browsing system to a rather
powerful user interaction system.  A good annotation infrastructure would move the
whole thing up a notch to a powerful collaboration system.

Our particular interest is using annotations for courseware.  The most obvious
scenario is professor posts course notes and problem sets on the webs.  Students
and teaching assistants should be able to annotate these documents to share
thoughts with other students.  Clearly, there should be various levels of
protections - different groups should have different abilities to annotate (e.g.
students registered in the course should be able to only write annotations, TA's should be
able to delete some annotations, etc).  

To summarize, some of the relevant design issues are:
 - the authorization issues described above.
 - arbitrary placement of annotations, the private annotation functionality as it
exists where all annotatins are linked at one place is insufficient.  So would the
document designer need to specify specific annotation points?? Optimally, one would
like to click anywhere and add an annotation.
  - document views - are annotations just another form of linkage or should there
be some mechanism for viewing the document with annotation embedded and then hiding
them (sort of like the outline collapse and expand feature you see in some outline
systems).
 - time-to-live of annotations - should there be a way to add annotations that
dissapear after a specified time?
 - How about moderated annotations?

Now I remember a draft group annotation design written by Andreeson that talked
about using usenet mail like features.  I thought I had hard-copied this document
but I can't find it and its no longer available on the web.  Does anybody have
this??

Count me in on any further discussions on this.  I think it opens up some real
interesting possibilities.

My approach was similar, in that I was going with CGI, and it is just 
starting to get out of my neurons.

However, mine is different in that there is no such thing as a file.  
Everything is a python object -- the document object is composed of a 
head object and a body object.  The body object is composed of tag 
objects for H1 classes, P classes, etc.  Each of these can have nested 
tags for A objects, which might contain a B object.  Hopefully I'll add 
the context rules from Dan's fabulous HTML2.0 documentation to say what 
is allowed in what.

This will allow everything down to a single character (if necessary) to 
have its own attributes (owner, access log, change log) and methods 
(right now the only one is object.render('terse' | 'verbose').  Hopefully 
I can put in some methods to lock each object, or keep track of changes.

>From the other side, I'm using Michael McLay's cgi.py python handling 
class to put it all onto HTTP.

This is just a bit of a snapshot.  To paraphrase: I am doing it without 
files, by decomposing HTML into objects in memory.

When this came up a year ago at the developer's workshop, I
promised to come up with a 'diff' format for HTML so that
incremental modifications to a document, annotations being one
case, could be stored separately and merged efficiently.

Needless to say, I didn't follow through, but it seems like a
useful meme to reinsert. We could use UNIX diff format, ala
'patch', or I expect there is an SGML convention for doing this.
We could work toward a format this is less brittle (e.g.,
instead of 'insert after line 17', do 'insert after paragraph
3' or even 'insert after the paragraph with the following keywords').

This discussion is coming close to some of the issues that the STILE 
project has been considering. We wish to provide students and staff 
at participating Universities with there own Web space. Then to 
provide tools for adding and modifying their data, and annotating and 
linking to other data. (The tools will, initially at least, only 
allow the creation and modification of Web documents conforming to a 
STILE format - we are don't have the programmer time to develop full 
HTML editors.)

Contraints of disk space and ownership mean that a system allowing 
annotations to be written to other people's disk space or even to 
large common areas are not likely to win favour in a University 
environment. The closest thing we have considered to true 
annotation then is building web space that links to other 
people's documents, and in some cases, contains, 
possibly modified, copies of them. 

The owner of the referenced documents can be emailed (eg) to let 
them know that their documents have been referenced, or maybe 
they just discover the fact themselves while browsing/searching. 
They are then at liberty to decide whether to add a link to the 
referencing documents. 

We too are investigating the possibilities of providing such 
facilities using CGI scripts and NCSA Forms. It looks possible, but 
fairly messy, requiring transmission of user name and passwords for 
every update (security hole?!), and the use of hidden fields to 
contain contextual information.

If this discussion is going elsewhere, I  would like to know 
where please.

I also am interested in this topic.

I have designed and implemented a system for small group shared annotation
which we'll use in the fall in teaching CS212.  It uses forms, and thus
works with current clients.  (I eagerly await authentication for clients.)

For more information, see http://dri.cornell.edu/pub/davis/annotation.html,
which includes a pointer to the current working demo.

For group and public annotations:

* If you're interested in a minimum-coding solution, forms
and CGI-bin scripts are a pretty good hack. HTTP authentication
isn't that hard -- ask Tony Sanders <sanders@bsdi.com>, and he can probably
point you toward the relavent perl code.

* If you're interested in a scalable solution, have a look
at USENET news! The only trick is to enhance browsers
to understand the message/rfc822 content type a little better,
(including message/rfc822 bodies whose bodies are text/html)
and to support NNTP posting and thread navigation.

Conventional newsreaders are bad because they keep a connection to the
NNTP server open during your whole section. But I'm sure they could be
modified to use the gopher/http connect-doit-disconnect style. But
you could have public NNTP servers that zap connections after they
go idle after a few seconds. Then folks with conventional newsreaders
would get the hint that they're not welcome.

You can use the USENET newsgroup hierarchy or make up your own.
You don't have to expire old articles.

And I'll just reinsert my comments made at the time 

(http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/.www-talk-1993q3.messages/130.html)

that a new markup element is needed (FIGT came close in one of the
proposals). Something that would be used as follows:

...
<h3>Meeting results</h3>
And then we decided to use a bivalve framistan in the motor.

<annotation>
I disagree with that decision for the following reasons...
</annotation>

This could be rendered: 
- on an overlay (selectively shown depending on the annotation's
author) offset to the left or right from the annotated text
- under the text in a distinct font
- as a separate page with an annotate link
- etc.

Allowing annotations at any place in the document is a level of complexity
higher than I had envisioned, and I'm not sure that it's completely
necessary for this.  I definitely don't think the annotations should be
directly inserted into the documents. This is a question for the
user-interface folks out there - how could this best be implemented such
that the original document maintains its original state yet you can see
where people annotated?  How then does this get implemented into HTTP?

I guess one answer is that when a document is retreived, an optional
comment-map is passed along, and the client users have the option of
seeing the document in its original state or marked up with hyperlinks
representing regions of the text.  This comment-map would be dynamically
generated from the database of comment thread heads as known by the server.
I.e., the client gets

http://www.wired.com/path/file.html

and then when the author wants to see the comments

http://www.wired.com/cgi-bin/gencommentmap/path/file.html

One thing I don't like about this model is that it encourages replying to 
only parts of the document rather than considering the document as a whole.
This is a problem on usenet - cascades and flame wars get vicious because
people liberally quote out of context and isolate certain phrases to 
sound like the author's a Nazi sympathizer. :)  

This also requires a higher level of complexity in the browsers.

Might I suggest we make this a later goal?  That for now we allow as
part of the protocal the ability to map a comment to a location in
the file, but don't demand that from browsers and servers as yet?

The above prophecy is, of course, USENET.  Now, we strongly considered
simply opening up USENET newsgroups for what we wanted to do, but it
seemed impractical - i.e. wired.flux, wired.fetish, wired.net.surf, etc...
I wasn't convinced that all sites would be willing to carry us, nor that
we'd be able to control the quality and interface to the discussion as
much as we'd want.  The WIT model (http://info.cern.ch/wit) is much more
like it - there is a LOT of value to a structured discussion, one that has
some sense of permanence, and a lot of value in "gardening" as we've seen
on the Well, and as such USENET doesn't (and by its nature probably never
will).

Instead of a change for the browser-base, how bout a change to the server 
base.  Basically, you're saying have the client talk to a news server, 
talking HTML over NNTP.

I would say put the change on the servers, either putting NNTP in the 
server or as a CGI app, to push broadcast HTML documents around.  Should 
be significantly easier.

My complaint then becomes one of granularity.  I don't think news can 
version beyond a document -- Lotus Notes has a feature called sections, 
which are a subpart of a document.  I would like to have the _potential_ 
for going down to tag ownership, but if not, at least being able to lock 
a "collection".

How does the nntp document numbering system fit in with the HTTP doc-id 
or URN stuff?

This is only of value for the restricted case where annotations are inlined
by the server which serves the main document---a very special case given the
fact that I want to be able to annotate arbitrary html documents independent
of whether or not the document server allows annotations.  However, it
does not harm to have a generic rendering element which puts things at the side
(marginalia).

Reply-To: murphy@dccs.upenn.edu

If I give the -n option to the www line mode client program,
and I've asked it to fetch something which is a "protected"
document, it prints the following message to stderr, and waits for
input from the terminal.

WWW: Document is protected. Enter username for Access Log Thang at stwing.resnet.upenn.edu
WWW: Username:  

This is a bug, in my opinion.  If -n is specified, and a document
requires a username and password, then the program should assume it
CANNOT get the file, that the file is unavailable.  It can print a
message to stderr saying WHY it's unavailable, but it should NOT stop
and wait for input from the terminal.  After all, I've said '-n' and
put it into the background.  Who knows, maybe I've even called it from
crontab!

I had those reversed, since POST was used for forms.  I also recall a
conversation with some folks about implementing collaborative engineering
over WWW using PUT.  There's no info in the document about REPLY.  You're
right, it does appear POST is the right direction: 

(from http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Methods/Post.html:)

(Jeez, the things you learn cruising around CERN :)

By the way, The LINK method looks VERY intriguing.  I'll post about
that in a separate message...

The trick is to get something that scales well.  Given that we want
someone who calls themselves "TimLeary" when they post a comment to our
site to keep and protect that name, we have to build a system that can
handle hundreds, thousands of distinct password-protected names
(recognizing this is only weak authentication). At least, this will be
true until SHTTP gives us true user-authentication. It also needs
to scale well in terms of the number of documents we expect.  I've been
warned that nothing less then a commercially-supported object database 
will be needed.

The problem with USENET, as I pointed out before, were the issues of 
control and interface... and I'd add now that I'm much more encouraged by 
the thought of getting stuff done in the WWW community than in the USENET 
community :)

Subject: WWW frontend to an Object-centered database (LINCKS)
content-length: 4573

Hi,

I have been working on a WWW frontend to our object-centered database,
LINCKS (available under GNU GPL) whenever I have time over ;-)
The first prototype have been running and used (mainly by myself)
for the last few months. It is implemented by using a CGI-program
which interfaces to a special database application (e.g. like gsql).

I'm currently rewriting the frontend as a standalone server
to gain speed and for making it simpler to distribution with the
rest of the database.  The current prototype only allows browsing,
but for the upcoming next i'm hope to add posting and possible
annotations. I'm posting this to get comments and feedback
concerning the current prototype before i'm to deep in the
next implementation.

And now it is interesting to use LINCKS as a backend?  (This
is cut from our release announcement).

What is LINCKS?

	LINCKS is an object-centred multi-user database system
	developed for complex information system applications where
	editing and browsing of information in the database is of
	paramount importance.  The focus is on sharing of small
	information chunks which combine to make up complex
	information objects used by different users for different
	purposes. The information chunks are semi-structured in that
	they contain one part which is well-structured to facilitate
	addition of A.I.  processing within the system, and one part
	which is unstructured and suitable for management by the user.

Some of LINCKS interesting features are:

       a) Multiple users - LINCKS is a multiuser database system.

       b) Composite objects - although all objects are built up of
	  small pieces, the user interface presents these as single
	  `composite objects', allowing editing over the entire
	  composite object using an Emacs-like editor.

       c) Database history - the LINCKS system maintains information
	  regarding the history of objects and actions within the
	  system.  Object history is maintained at both the single
	  chunk and composite object level. Past versions of objects
	  can be accessed and reactivated.

       d) Alternative views - LINCKS allows a user or application
	  developer to interactively define alternative views on the
	  underlying database objects. This is particularly useful in
	  applications where the same information is to be used for
	  different purposes or by people in differing roles which
	  require a different composition and display.

       e) Information sharing - LINCKS provides an easy way for users
	  to share database objects or for one user to share
	  information across all of her/his accessible objects.  This is
	  done by linking objects into composition objects.  Thereby,
	  any changes to that object by one user will result in updates
	  to all compositions which have that object as an component.

       f) Parallel Editing Notification - As LINCKS is a multi-user
	  system and allows information sharing, this leads to possible
	  conflicts.  Consequently, the LINCKS system maintains a list
	  of objects being edited and issues warnings when parallel
	  editing occurs.

For the WWW application the b, d, e, and f is most interesting. Then
current prototype generates HTML on the fly from documents in the
database. A document's structure is described by a grammar (similiar to a DTD,
but very simple), but also specified is _where_ in the database the
differents parts of the logical structure should be fetched. 

By using different views applied to the same document root object 
we are able to generate:

a) the full document
b) a brief table contents (toplevel) with links to different 
   section etc
c) a full table contents ...

and this without any need to create new/split file. We have a _single_
source for every different views. When authoring documents, you only
have to inserted a link document, not use the usual cut-and-paste with
which you can lose tracibility. 

Enough rambling for now, if you find the server at

  http://www-lincks.ida.liu.se:8080/w3l/DB/httpd

and it is a tad slow currently. You might have to wait for a
while before getting information back. I have had the time
to add much material to the underlaying database, it is 
all most the same database as we distribution with the source,
e.g. information about using our X11 interface to the database,
some general information.  

regards,

msj

All:

First, since I'm not a member of the www-talk@info.cern.ch mail alias;
so please start including me on the CC line of this discussion
thread about public annotations.

I've been working on public annotations for several months now.
I am in the process of writing something up for submission to
at the October WWW conference.  However, since the topic has
come up, I thought I'd share my incomplete results (broken links,
awful English, missing sections, poor organization etc.) with you.

You can find what I've got at:

	http://playground.sun.com/~gramlich/1994/annote

an example public annotation can be found at:

	http://playground.sun.com/~gramlich/1992/publishing/publishing.html

The goals of my system are:

	1) to support the ability to annote annotations,
	2) to support in-line annotations (unimplemented),
	3) to support distributed annotations (to support
	   better scaling),
	4) to explore link voting, and
	5) to encourage people to publish on the Web.

Any early feedback will be greatly appreciated.

			Thanks,
				-Wayne

Strict ISO 9660 (ie without the extensions) has limited filenames
(as well as a small allowable charset).  If you stick to strict
ISO 9660 file/directory naming, it isn't a problem.

DOS/Windows does not support the extensions commonly found in UNIX CD
drivers, and hence will never understand long names.

If you *really* want it to work with long names, you could modify WinMosaic
to understand the "Rock Ridge" extensions, read the mapping file on the CD,
etc.

Personally, I would stick to ISO 9660 naming for multi-platform use and
rename the files.  If they are all hyperlinks, users won't care/notice
what the filenames are.

Hi all:

	Internally, Rutgers has been discussing different methods of
providing secure WWW service.  We've decided to open this discussion
up to the rest of the WWW community, and have created yet another
mailing list.  	This list will focus on how to secure HTTP and/or
HTTP-like protocols to provide:

	o Privacy
	o User Authentication
	o Service Certification
	o Document Checking (Digital Signatures)

	and anything that I've forgotten!

To subscribe, send mail with a body of: 

subscribe www-security

to www-security-request@nsmx.rutgers.edu

Messages should be sent to www-security@nsmx.rutgers.edu 
(big surprise, I know.. :)

Subject: Information integration at client or server?
content-length: 4749

I alluded to this issue earlier, but it's nagging me, so I thought I'd make
it explicit.  As I suggested in the earlier message, I see the Web in terms
of packaging information for navigation.

"Packaging" is enabled by the wide availability and variety of browsers
(Mosaic, etc.) that deliver a consistent user interface.  It makes sense
that this takes place at the client, to accomodate lots of users on a
variety of platforms with a variety of tasks.  The standards for URLs and
HTML make packaging possible.  Thus the retrieval and data formatting
standards drive the browsers.

"Navigation" becomes possible via integration of information sources.
Links among related information sources can be created.  This could take
place at the client, but since there are inevitably fewer authors than
readers, it makes sense to do this integration at the server.  Thus it's
the servers make the "web-like" connections among information sources and
the servers are the Web, and HTTP, as the communications standard for the
servers, ties it all together.

(I realize that there are those who believe the net and hypertext will make
all people into authors and publishers, but I don't buy into that ideology.
I do believe that large numbers of people will contribute to
consensus-building, but that's not the same as authorship.)

This scenario suggests that gopher, ftp and wais slowly fade away as far as
browsers are concerned, with the information that they provide becoming
integrated via CGI applications at the servers.  I think this would be a
good thing for users, the vast majority of which probably don't want to
have to make a distinction among them.

An alternative scenario, which really would create multiple Webs, is that
the browser developers increasingly "bypass" HTTP for the communications
efficiency of going directly to the source, rather than the double layer of
HTTP server and CGI application.  Although the users would still enjoy the
benefit of a consistent user interface, the opportunity to integrate
information from heterogeous sources would be lost.

In other words, I'm suggesting that if there's a threat to the integrity of
the Web on the browser side, we'll see it manifested by the arrival of new
schemes.  I was almost guilty of this myself.  While building a prototype
"Web" front end to CompuServe, I came up with a scheme called "cis" for
URLs that would know how to retrieve messages, etc. from CompuServe forums.
In retrospect, even though that's a quick way to get information on-line,
it's a step toward building a part of the Web that doesn't link easily to
other parts, just as the gopher, ftp and wais schemes don't really
integrate.

Okay, all this begs the question of what I mean by "integration" of
information sources.  I think it means a few things:

<ul><li>The ability to do simultaneous searches of heterogeneous sources.
With wais, that's possible today only if they're all wais sources.  Via a
CGI application, I can include lots of other kinds of sources.

<li>Hypertext linking of key words to documents.  For example, I link the
names of companies in press releases to backgrounders that contain
management and financial data.  They are from two different sources.

<li>Cross-indexing of hetergenous sources -- I can generate an index to
participants in a group of related mailing lists, for example.  (Among
other things, this helps me find interesting things by seeing other places
where you all post messages!)

<li>Cross-cataloging of sources -- Tools that do relevancy ranking, such as
Topic, can sort information into a subject hierarchy, offering new views of
the information.  For example, I could take all of the messages in the
various Web-related newsgroups and arrange them by topic, in addition to
their "native" structure (and get rid of the redundancies and even some of
the thread drift at the same time).</ul>

I'm sure there are more examples.

In summary, I think there's an important direction decision that could be
made.  Should browser developers be actively discouraged from supporting
additional schemes, in order to force data to flow through HTTP servers?
Should they just not be encouraged to do so?  Is information integration at
the client a good thing, after all?

It seems to me that there are some significant implications for HTML as
well, under the assumption if it fails to provide the means to describe the
structure of information coming from heterogeneous sources, that's a
virtual guarantee that the browser developers will bypass HTTP as the
delivery protocol, I'd imagine.

Lots of good stuff.

It's attractive in some respects to have everybody doing the same
thing, and HTTP is in the lead.

But if we're going to try to boil the web down to one protocol,
let's get it right:

	* cut out the TCP connection set-up time by using a UDP
	based protocol like prospero/ARDP.

	* put authentication and compression in the transport
	layer (ARDP).

	* Allow for replicated servers and objects.

	* Separate object names from network locations

	* Support data authentication (MD5 checksums, digital
	signatures, etc.)

I don't think we can do all this with HTTP in the short term. In
the mean time, "Let a thousand flowers bloom."

The relavance feedback in the WAIS protocol, along with the
original-server/distributor-server distinctions are features that
I don't want lost from the web. NNTP has some features we shouldn't
lose either (though it should be revised to use a request-response
protocol like ARDP rather than a session based protocol like TCP).

On the other hand, I won't miss FTP or gopher. Not that there's anything
wrong with them, but their functionality is subsumed by HTTP.

We have a funny mix of interactions over the client-server path.
There are lots of fairly small transactions which possibly would be
handled better by a transaction oriented transport than with TCP.

On the other hand we move a lot of big files and this is where
the optimizations of TCP/IP can be really useful, especially the 
changes made to avoid network congestion.

We should be careful.  One of the big problems we've got in network
management is all the restrictions we bought into by using UDP
underneath SNMP.  I'd prefer to avoid having to deal with
over-simplified transports.

Yes (to authenticaion and especially compression)!

Actually, the trends I see point in the opposite direction.  Due to  
the unifying concepts of URLs and MIME, HTTP provides a convenient,  
portable, widely available tool for distributing and hyperlinking  
*any* sort of static or interactive information.  To the extent that  
HTML fails to fulfill needs, HTTP rather stands to gain in relative  
importance.

Two important examples of this trend on the horizon:
   * Several groups are working on HTTP-based hyper-TeX (really
      hyper-DVI) for distributing mathematical and scientific text.
   * WIRED is leading a discussion on HTTP-based distributed virtual
      reality.  A large number of commercial and academic groups have
      expressed interest in working on this.

As far as I can see, the pressures to move beyond HTTP and HTML are  
coming from different sources.  The server maintainers are the ones  
who are looking for new protocols beyond HTTP, while the browser  
authors are the ones looking for models of content beyond HTML.

These pressures aren't necessarily bad.  I agree that what makes the  
Web the Web -- what must remain constant in all these scenarios in  
order to hold the Web together -- is the hyperlink, the dynamic  
combination of:
   1. URI addressing,
   2. MIME typing, and
   3. link relationship values.
Naturally, it is also helpful if the number of protocols and content  
models is small, but I don't think that total unity is needed.

The solution to (nicely) restarting a W3 server with threads in mount 
point handlers or dynamically changing/removing an active BGI mount 
point in an OS independent manner is relatively straight forward.

Presumably there is a table in the server providing a mapping between 
mount points and function pointers.  For each mount point handler, keep 
two additional pieces of information, a state variable and a reference 
count.  When a BGI handler is successfully initialized, set the ref 
count to zero and the state to active.  In addition, keep a ref count 
on the whole table and initialize it to zero.

When a mount handler is called, increment the handler reference count 
and the table ref count.  When the handler returns, decrement the ref counts.

When a mount point is deleted or changed, set the state to inactive.  
All subsequent searches for this mount point will see the state is 
inactive and ignore this entry and either go on to find its replacement 
or fail and notify the client.

When a mount point's ref count goes to zero and the state is inactive, 
do the appropriate cleanup (unmount, unload of entry point, remove from 
table etc.).

To stop or restart the server falls out from the above architecture.  
Set all of the entries in the mount point table to inactive and wait 
for the table ref count to go to zero.

The above data structures of course need to be thread protected.

Simon, do you have any target dates for the BGI spec?

Version 15 of the Common Lisp HTTP server is available.

The server is described in the WWW94 hypertext.
(http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/server-abstract.html)

You can obtain a Lisp Machine distribution or the sources.

Lisp Machine (Genera 8.3):  ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/users/jcma/cl-http/lispm.reel-1

Non-lispm (Server Sources): ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/users/jcma/cl-http/sources.tar.Z

The main features include fully object-oriented implementation, typed
condition handling, and rapid prototyping in Common Lisp.

Ports to MAC Common Lisp, Lucid Common Lisp, and Franz Allegro Common Lisp are
underway.  

If you would like to help with one of the ports, please send mail to the
developers at bug-cl-http@research.ai.mit.edu

A homepage will follow as the ports make the technology available to wider
communities.

Perhaps the CERN team will list this full-featured server in their list of
servers, even though it implements everything from scratch in its 6K lines of
LISP.

(I'm posting this at the urging of Larry Masinter, who thought it might
be interesting.)

I haven't been following the discussion about "binary HTTP" very
closely, but a possibly useful tool is PARC's ILU system, a freely
available object interface system which includes flexible object RPC
code.  I know that many of you are familiar with it.  Using ILU would
involve describing an interface in `ISL', ILU's Interface Specification
Language.  This interface is programming-language and network-protocol
independent.  ILU tools then compile this ISL to specific programming
languages and network protocols and transports.  ILU hides all the
connection management and transport layers from the application
programmer, allowing them to be modified and experimented with at will,
so that different protocols can be used with transports of different
characteristics, without the application program having to know about
it.  TCP or UDP could be used transparently.  This would prevent WWW
from falling into the trap of having to define a bit format on the wire,
or overly specific connection protocols.

More information on ILU, and the 1.6.4 distribution, can be found at
ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html.

Just to give you the flavor, an *extremely* simple ISL description for a
WWW server might be (I haven't tried to ``compile'' this :-):

  (* ======= interface for simple WWW service *)
  (* == Bill Janssen <janssen@parc.xerox.com> 20.7.94 *)
  INTERFACE WWW-Simple;

  TYPE URL = ilu.CString;
  TYPE Document = ilu.CString;

  (* define a format name for format negotiation *)

  TYPE FormatName = ilu.CString;
  TYPE Formats = SEQUENCE OF FormatName;

  (* only one exception, a "bad URL" with a value of URL *)

  EXCEPTION BadURL : URL;

  (* and one object type, the server *)

  TYPE Server = OBJECT
    METHODS
      Get (id : URL, acceptableFormats : Formats) : Document
        RAISES BadURL END
    END;
  (* ======= end of WWW-Simple == *)

A more interesting interface might be

  (* ======= slightly more capable WWW interface *)
  (* == Bill Janssen <janssen@parc.xerox.com> 20.7.94 *)
  Interface WWW-Still-Simple IMPORTS WWW-Simple END;
  
  (* use URL type from WWW-Simple *)

  TYPE Header = RECORD name : ilu.CString, value : ilu.CString END;

It might also be fun to mix the ``Document'' class into the ``Server''

folders).  A lot of variations on these themes can be played...

Have you looked at T/TCP -- TCP Extensions for Transactions, RFC1644?

[This is the kind of issue that www-speed is set up to handle]

I'll be dealing with this on www-speed shortly with the grand http 
futures compare-and-contrast report, but since this ties in nicely, I'll 
just through in a few quick comments, especially since I already posted 
a report on how TCP and HTTP get in each other's way.

  Abandoning TCP completely is almost always a bad idea. There are 
exceptions to this rule; however unless the traffic pattern is almost 
always to a different host, and the typical message size fits in a single 
packet, you'ld better have a bloody good excuse :-)

One of the problems with going from TCP to an application specific 
transport protocol is that you lose all the work that has gone into 
making TCP work, and work well. 

Any responsible wide-area transport protocol must implement slow-start, 
or the network will soon enter congestion collapse (see Nagle's RFC on 
what  used to happen before slow start existed). Any new transport layer 
will  need to deal with recieve windows, retransmissions, time outs, round
trip time estimation, and  message re-assembly. You can't even just use 
UDP - if you want to do path MTU discovery, you need to twiddle the Don't 
Fragment bit in the IP header. 

By the time you've finished, what you've ended up with is your own 
private implementation of TCP..

In the report I have shortish section on how changing the transport layer 
can help, and what the costs are. The best solution along this dimension 
of the solution space is probably to use Bob Braden's T/TCP, which is a 
backwards compatible change to TCP which solves some of the problems with
TIME_WAIT, slow start, and the three-way handshake. 

The real problem isn't with TCP, it's with HTTP. TCP is like planet 
earth; abuse her and rape her resources, and she'll wreak vengance upon 
you unto the fourth generation; Treat her with love and respect, and 
she'll grant you a bountiful harvest for ever. [Overblow similies 'R' Us]


> 	* put authentication and compression in the transport

See above; unless you have real reasons for putting this in the transport 
layer, you're almost always better off on the internet layering these 
services above transport. 

> 	* Allow for replicated servers and objects.
> 	* Separate object names from network locations

These two are part of a broader problem; name resolution and resource 
discovery. I've done some work on this with the centroid architecture I 
developed for whois++ and which has been adopted by SOLO; I hope to do 
more with the next draft of SID (Simple Internet Directory). Although I have 
great hope there will be a URN proposal within my lifetime, that hope is 
predicated on my giving up smoking :-/ The Web as a whole may be better 
off using one existing international standards, and using either the 
name format defined in RFC 1487, or user friendly names (RFC 1484).

I will be adding support for SOLO into MDMA to make it easier to 
experiment with names versus locations. SOLO is not a viable long-term 
solution for Name->URL lookup, but it's real easy to code for, and 
Paul-Andre has already added SOLO support to libwww, so client support is 
easy. 

SID is designed to be a general purpose Directory lookup service (this 
one *is* layered on top of UDP, because it meets the 'single-packet' 
criteria). It's based on a modified form of  LDAP (Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol), but using a  Whois++/SOLO style centroid architecture, 
with all requests and responses tuned for the common case, and using the 
Packet encoding rules. The end result gives a protocol that packages the 
power of X.500 and the flexibility of Whois++ into a packet format with 
less than half the overhead of DNS, and with a much cuter acronym

maybe it's because 12 years of using usenet has affected
my mind, but i think WIT imposes too much structure.

for technical discussions on the level of `should feature
X be implemented in protocol Y?' the agree/disagree model
may work.  but it seems to impose an argumentative mode
without necessarily requiring one.  WIT seems to break down 
for more mundane conversations, like discussions of movies
(one of the early topics).

also, i can't imagine trying to follow a continuing
conversation in WIT.  it would be nice to see a list of
recent messages without having to enter each area of
topic/proposal/etc.

on the positive side, messages in WIT are *much* easier to
read than usenet messages, due to the automatic HTML encoding
(no more courier font!).  and for those who know HTML well 
enough, it looks like great fun to be able to write the 
message itself in HTML.

These new mailing lists - are they archived anywhere? Good thing about www-talk 
is that you can look back for similar threads. Or find something that didn't 
interest you at the time, but does now.

My concern is that these new lists are not archived so if, for example, I need 
to know about security issues in 3 months time, I cannot find out what has 
already been worked through. If new lists are being archived, please say where; 
if not, please state that fact so that people who are marginally interested can 
subscribe and stuff the trafic into a mailbox against the time they need it.

I have been working with the WWW for quite some time but, unfortunately,
have been so busy with my work it has been at the cost of participating
in discussion groups such as this.

Each day I become more and more aware of companies who are working on
commercial versions of MOSAIC with some secret value-added ingredient,
like: performance, security, etc.

Does anyone have either the beginnings of a list, or a complete list,
of companies and what they plan to offer. It'd be nice to have a clear
picture of the future in this area and to be able to sort the wheat from
the chaff.

Thanks!!

Please excuse any ignorance -- I am new to the list but not new to the Web.

This list is very interesting but, unfortunately, I simply do not have the
time to keep up with it. It seems to cover a lot of ground. I am looking
for a list that specialises, focuses, on the implementations of Web servers
for customers, i.e.

                    Public Network Web Servers  (e.g. Internet),
                    Private Network Web Servers (e.g. Internal I.S.),
                    Leased Web Servers          (e.g. Commercenet).

The purpose would be to discuss ideas on design, structure, multi-Web
servers, applications, etc etc.

However, I am hesitant to create and announce 'yet another WWW mailing
list'. What is the consensus of opinion. Are these discussions ideally
suited to be based here -- sorry I have not read the archives -- does
such a list exist, or is this a candidate for a separate list?

Thanks!!

Yeah -- what he said. I try to keep up with a lot of this stuff in
real-time, but it's overwhelming, and I'd like to be able to go
back over the discussion in 6months or a year.

[When going back over the list, it helps if folks have edited the
subject lines appropriately when they change the subject, and
correct In-Reply-To:, References:, headers are nice, not to
mention From: or Reply-To:, and Content-Type:. Some mailing list
software seems to munge these beyond recognition. ]

I'm going to add www-security to my hypermail-like archive.  I think I'm
also going to create a set of aliases to the top-level menus for the list
archives, so that they have somewhat more meaningful filenames than the
machine-generated numeric ones I'm using.

The home page for the server is <http://asearch.mccmedia.com/>.  The
Web-related list menu page is <http://asearch.mccmedia.com/menus/8256.htm>.
Aliases don't seem to be working this morning.  Maybe I'm not awake yet;
when I figure out why they're returning blank pages, I'll post the aliases
here.

Nick

P.S.  Just read Dan Connolly's message.  Six months?!  I'm keeping four
weeks' worth in the menus; the rest are accessible only via full-text
search.  I'm not sure how many subject headings would appear in a six-month
menu, but it's quite a lot.  However, I have a strategy that will help make
more accessible.  Using relevance-ranking and human (me) oversight, I'm
working on a gizmo that will sort messages into "real" subject headings, a
hierarchical outline of the  subjects discussed on the various lists that
I'm archiving.  There will probably be some choices about which lists to
include, since this will be a cross-list outline.  I'll have more than just
messages, too, it'll include documents that relate, tool and product
profiles, etc.  In other words, I'm working on packaging Web-related
information for navigability.  Of course, no promises when any of these
features will arrive... ;-)

ISL seems like a natural for this kind of thing... when I last
looked at it, there were some outstanding issues with data pipes.
Since it's not reasonable to require clients to marshal/unmarshal
entire objects (files etc.) in memory, we would certainly want
to use pipes in the HTTP protocol.

Other than that, we just need to come up with a "grandfather" transport
that uses TCP and RFC822 syntax. Then, once we have the abstraction
tested, we can replace the transport layer.

If anybody is working on this, let me know. I've done a bunch of
python prototyping in this area.

Dan

p.s. Mr. Janssen: I recall some oblique reference you made to
python support in ILU. I can't seem to find it anywhere in
the web rooted at ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html

Is it available for alpha/beta testing?

Absolutely. All the talk about statelessness in the HTTP protocol goes 
against the notion of a virtual circuit. You've just pushed down the
state down into the lower layers...

Either that, or introduce state into the protocol to allow for efficient
authentication and compression. Then by all means, keep TCP so that
a single channel can be authenticated once per "session" or "state"
and you can go with it...

I think a lot of people are already thinking about this. A lot of
the ideas I'm hearing about have authentication and compression happening
way upstream from the transport layer though. My personal feeling is
that it belongs down in transport, so that the application developers
are not bothered with these notions. Send data from point A to B. Here's
some (optional) authentication (i.e. my public key). I don't care
how it got there and how many bytes it took. Just get it there...

> 
> 	* Allow for replicated servers and objects.
>
Another YES! However, replicated servers require their own management/
coordination transport. You're talking next-generation "super-servers"
who can do this sort of thing without the service providers knowing
about it. As for objects... well, that's a whole other can of worms (;-)

> 
> 	* Separate object names from network locations
>
Agree. However, name->location lookups may begin to constitute the
majority of network traffic. Replicated servers should help localize
that a little. All the URL talk is not going to solve the problem
of location transparency. URN's might, but nothing I've seen up to
now does it. You can't embed location independence in the naming scheme
alone. You need lots of infrastructure (name-servers, agents, etc...) 
to make it work.

> 
> 	* Support data authentication (MD5 checksums, digital

> 
This sort of goes with authentication above. Digital signatures would
be necessary only if you start talking privacy and/or billing. If you
start having pay-for-service type activity, you want to know who is
charging and who is being charged. Also, if someone submits trade secret
material into the web, some people may want to know who did it. I am
not a complete proponent of such concepts, but once you embark on the
road to commercial services, authentication is one of those things 
you better have lined up WAY ahead of time... It can't be a hack on a
patch on a revision on an option that someone adds later on...

Although an awful lot of folks seem to be trying (;-) And YES! I agree
that more options should be there. If anything, I appreciate that these
issues are being raised.

ARDP is a nice transport concept. I'm not sure I would extend it all
the way up to application-level protocols. There are variations on
ARDP out there that have slightly less overhead but with less smarts
in terms of failure recovery. I also personally think ARDP is a million
times more interesting and efficient from an academic perspective than
HTTP. I know they're different beasts, but ARDP has so many things built
in that would make life easier to implement HTTP.

Every new service seems to concentrate the best features of the previous
services and throw a few new things in there. Just like News built on top
of UUCP concepts, gopher goes beyond ftp and WWW goes beyond gopher. 
I'm certain the next series of services out there will take the WWW
notion and throw a few unique things of their own...

I feel differently - USENET is the perfect example of unstructured
discussion, for better AND worse :)  Mailing lists suffer from this
at times too - anyone who was on the WWW Marketing mailing list saw
this happen last week.  WIT's particular structure is good for what
CERN probably wanted - a way to classify proposals and the method
for agreeing or disagreeing to it.  I don't think that particular 
structure is what I'd implement here, but the *ability* to structure it 
like that is a very good thing.

Right - instead of the "agree/disagree" dichotomy, tags like
"elaboration" "counterpoint", and maybe the ability to bring
a thread back up to the top level when a new idea has emerged
from it, seems like a good way to go.  Can one classify discourse
into a small set of types without unnaturally restricting the flow of 
the conversation?  I think so... but I admit it remains to be seen.

Yup!  That's the best part!  :)

Okay, I've started the hyper-archive of www-security, along with the other
Web, etc. lists and newsgroups on my server.  The top menu for the security
list can be reached through my hierarchical menus or via the alias:

http://asearch.mccmedia.com/www-security.html

I haven't yet added it to the full-text engine; I'll wait until there are a
few more messages on the list.

For those of you who've found my server a bit slow at times, I will be
moving the most recent messages onto a server with a much faster network
connection shortly.  I need to change the code a bit to accomodate relative
references and such.

[followups to www-speed]

So that Rob doesn't feel like I'm picking on him, I'm going to pick on Tony 
and Ari as well :-)

I've done some comparative shopping using a few servers (and probably have 
the record for the most separate http servers ever running on one machine
at the same time :-) 

The Victims were:

MDMA, release 0.1 pre-alpha
CERN, release 3.0pre6
NCSA, release 1.3
PLEXUS, release 2.2.1

Although I haven't had enough time to do a full set of benchmarks, the results
are still kind of interesting. These tests were run using web-whacker.

[In these tests, the data set was kept small enough to fit entirely in main
memory- this is because the test server only has 32Mb, (an order of magnitude
less than the target  system). I hope to do more realistic tests next week, 
using a true log based frequency table.]

[When I refer to a 'loader' I'm talking about an artificial load generator

Plexus had difficulties even when the query rates were halved. Plexus was 
the only daemon to fail castastrophically in this test.

When the tests were run for more trials, the times for CERN and NCSA continued
to grow, which is as expected. The same was observed in MDMA 12 loader case.

I'm going to do another table of load tolerance at lower query rates next.

What do the table values mean?  Amount of time it took each server to return
1500 accesses or each access?

I'd also like to see some benchmarks for servers using user authentication.
I did some simple stuff the other day with NCSA httpd on our Indigo which 
suggested that for sites that expect their heavy load to be around 3 
accesses per second, a user database of about 10,000 is as high as one 
should go, though I think that could be improved by a daemon that keeps 
the user database in memory (an option only as long as the user database 
is the same for the whole system, I suppose).

User Authentication can really foul up the system. If you use RSA public key
the time for doing the key checking starts to dominate very quickly. This 
is why EIT and myself are trying to work out how to minimise the number of
RSA ops needed. We are doing a lot of symetric and hashing key stuff at
the moment.

On strategies for making the code run faster I think we need to consider
some radical departures. The essential starting point however is to improve
the code base.


In the to do list is making the MIME parsers sensible, better error recovery
and memory handling. Once that is done we should try to make the interface
to configuration files much cleaner. This would then allow us to splice in a 
database engine. A database may be slow compared to raw UNIX for 100 users.
But a good database takes more or less the same time for querying 100 users,
10,000 users or 100,000. More on this stuff later...



The encryption stuff I expect will be solved eventually through hardware.
Whatever the technical merits we will never get the public to accept a
software only system. There must be a physical action required to confirm,
something a little harder than clicking a button (press here to order 
a lorry load of quick drying cement/ Ferrari F40/ Clipper chip). This 
indicates to me that there will be a credit card type device, an a cheap
RS232 reader ($5 each in quantity, sent out to subscribers for free). So
I expect the RSA stuff to have hardware assist in any case.

National Semiconductor are making just such a system, with a PCMCIA type card and 
a cheap reader. Darn if I can remember the name of it right now...

Personally, I'd like to see some benchmarks on things like
using server includes and other processing type items. It would
be nice to know how to develop efficent web pages, and to know
what the tradeoffs between efficiency and low maintenance are.

Yeah, what she said. This is all done by guesswork at the moment. We don't 
do server includes in case there is a real performance hit - but we don't 
know. 

We don't do fancy indexes because our server root is in AFS and it is 
rumoured to be slow... Knowing the actual performance penalties for 
particular things would enable much more rational decisions to be taken when 
considering what snazzy thing to do.

Such benchmarks would need careful design though. For example, a system 
which parses all html files to look for includes will perform differently 
from one that marks including and non-including files as distinct, only 
processing the latter. And systems of the second type will perform 
differently if they can cache the result of the include so subsequent 
accesses involve no processing.

So benchmarks will only allow comparison between version x of server Y and 
version a of server B. In itself that would be handy, though.

Subject: Waiting for HTML+ for executing LOCAL (serverless) scripts??
content-length: 1020

Hi all,

I've read in a prereleased paper about differences of HTML and HTML+ that 
in HTML+ it will be (hopefully) possible to execute LOCAL SCRIPTS
without needing a SERVER, so forms could be executed at your local site.

Using CD-based LOCAL WEB's would be handier for some applications (having
one or more links to THE REAL WEB (Transparency)) but if you use forms
now in HTML you are in a dilemma (like me)!

IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY TO EXECUTE LOCAL SCRIPTS JUST NOW AT THIS TIME 
(even tricky solution!)?
HOW? 

I thought about setting up local ".mailcap" or "mime.types" to create
an explicit application named "application/perl; THE_LOCAL_PATH_OF/perl" to
start an external 'viewer' (program -> perl) which evaluates the given
arguments and send back the ordered data to the browser (by starting a new
browser for e.g. (yes, it's ugly, but it's only a 1st thought!)) but can't
this be done easier or more delightful???

Any suggestions?


Thanks for all patience...

I havn't seen Lynx yet but I will do it if I will ever have time to do it.

But, I think that your hint is only accessable to Lynx. I tried it using
XMosaic 2.4 and it seems that XMosaic wasn't able to resolve something like
'href=exec://localhost/DIRS/FILE' or
'href=exec:///DIRS/FILE' 
but our used CERN-SERVER instead prompted with an error msg that it is unable
to get the demanded file...

Trying to use a patched (DOS-) Telnet.exe (-> replacing by perl.exe or 
something like that)
can't be used, because if I have a REAL TELNET://-request in another HTML-file
(on UNIX, e.g) I would get into perl... and I don't want to have OS-specific 
html-documents!
(That's independant from having local OS-specific BROWSER-Configs, of course!)

BTW: I've read the URL-Doc's at CERN, but never found ANY spec on 'exec:' or
something else!

Thanks (and please forgive my bad English!)

   No need to mess around with the mailcap files etc.  If you use Lynx,
NCSA Mosaic/X, or the emacs-w3 browser, you can use the x-exec URL
syntax.  (Emacs-w3 can use this by default, but you will have to patch
Lynx/Mosaic - try searching the WWWWorm for x-exec and you should find
the refs to the patches)

   Basic syntax is

x-exec://progname/foo/bar/baz?blort

   progname will be looked for in 'trusted' directories on your local
machine - no explicit paths are allowed.  (So no x-exec://bin/rm/*)

   The progname is executed the same way a CGI script is on an HTTP
server.  Uses the same environment variables, etc. The script can return
either an HTTP/0.9 response, or a full HTTP/1.0 response.

   I am not sure if the Lynx and Mosaic patches have been updated for
the new CGI spec, but emacs-w3 handles it correctly.

	I'm not sure I understand.   I thought we retained the syntax 
[user[:pass]@]host[:port]  for the part after the double slash even for 
things like this.   (news is throwing me for a loop on this same point) 
Doesn't look quite as  "Uniform"  as I had hoped.   :-( 
 
	Knowing that  exec:  means  "run this command"  and doesn't 
have any relation to a protocol,  I can accept that  host, user, etc 
information is meaningless.   In that case,  is it wrong to forbid 
the double slash?   (enforcing a connection between double slash 
and  host, user, etc  type information.

Greetings,
	We have been having a small, local discussion on the efficiency of
FTP vs. HTTP. One of the items I pointed out was that for serving up an HTML
document with inlined images, FTP is very inefficient because of the startup
costs for every inlined images. Later I got to thinking that this would be
an obvious place for an optimization: leave the FTP open until done parsing
the HTML document in case any inlined images (or whatever) might be needed.
	This morning I confirmed that MacWeb 1.0a2, MacMosaic 2.0a2, XMosaic
2.4, and WinMosaic 2.0a2 take the inefficient approach of a separate ftp
connection for each inlined image. It would seem that optimizing this would
help the load on ftp servers, and response time to the user.

	And Dan suggested that we rewrite TCP for similar reasons. 
 
	Yeah ... it's overhead.   I say,  leave it in there for the 
sake of compatibility.   Let each transaction be a separate TCP (FTP) 
connection for the sake of uniformity.   I'm not advocating waste, 
but bandwidth is getting cheaper,  CPU cycles are getting cheaper, 
and storage is getting cheaper.   The economics are against some 
kinds of optimizations. 
 
	Now ... if the library had some "trick" whereby it could 
leave that FTP control socket open across URLs,  fine.   There'd have to 
be some kind of time-out so that if the control socket remained unused 
it would close automatically.   But I strongly suspect that this all 
serve to hinder the portability of the library code.   Then too, 
everyone should bear in mind that not all WWW clients and servers 
are using the same library nor even any of its derivatives.

FTP _is_ an inefficient protocol for serving HTML documents with inlined
images, period (in fact, I'd be personally inclined to say FTP is an
inefficient protocol, period.  :^)  However, NCSA Mosaic for Windows
and its progeny DO leave the connection open (permanently, as a matter of
fact, until the server times it out.)  I thought this was true of 2a2, but
it certainly should be of later releases (unless this was changed since I
left.)  AIR Mosaic leaves it open.

I pretty much agree, and have been amazed that some of its limitations have
not been addressed in the more recent servers (such as wuftpd). But for some
people, it is all they have available. Though maybe that will encourage
their providers to install httpd :-)

Hmm, oops. I think I realize the problem now. WinMosaic was setup to use a
proxy server. So, that was CERN HTTPd 2.0pre5's fault, not WinMosaic. (The
same actually for all the Mosaic's I tried. So, some of them might already
have dealt with it...)

Oh - I thought it was CERN HTTPd version 3.0pre5 ;-)

This is no fault - it is the intended way the FTP client works in the
World-Wide Web Library of common code. The problem is typical when
trying to fit a state protocol like FTP into a state less framework
like HTTP. The arguments for the current implementation are:

1) The "standard" time-out period for a FTP-server when connected as
anonymous user is 3-6 minutes. In that time a user can access quite a
lot of FTP-servers and the probability that the FTP-servers simply will
block due to overload is substantial.

2) The FTP protocol doesn't define a hierarchical file structure like
HTTP using URI's. That is, you have no guarantee that you can get from
one place in the file hierarchy on a FTP server to another using CD
and/or CDUP (you can't in general assume that you can use one CD to jump
to the new location). The only way to be sure is to start a new login
session.

Actually the Library _does_ support a FTP session where the control
connection can be reused. The client asks to set up a session and tells
when to take it down again. This is intended to use when/if the client
supports multiple selections from a FTP listing so that the user can
request, e.g., 10 files, the whole directory etc. etc. This doesn't
require any CD's or CDUP and can be done in a "safe" manner.


***

One final comment - why use FTP for retrieving HTTP documents at all
(with or without inlined images???)

Quick note:

the FTP protocol creates a new data connection for every single 
transaction - the saving comes from not having to set up the control 
connection; leaving the control connection open still leaves FTP as being
even worse than HTTP (sad, isn't it :-)

This is true - the reason why WinMosaic leaves the control connection open
is that this initial control connection can be expensive to set up, and if
you are connecting to an anonymous server that is often overloaded (for
example, wuarchive.wustl.edu or ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu :^), without cacheing the
control connection you'll be able to get each document, say, 1 time for every
six tries.  Cacheing the control connection, you'll have this only once (for
the first document), then you'll be "logged in".  I know, ugly in comparison
to the statelessness of HTTP, but that's FTP.  It's really not intended to
serve "documents" in the same sense as HTTP.

Subject: Audio and video files for Mosaic
content-length: 261

What tools (hardware and software) are recommended for generating
audio and motion video files to be supported on a WWW/Mosaic server?
We are currently using wav and au files and are not pleased with the
quality.

Any recommendations will be appreciated.

Real problem with "leave it open" is how to deal with relative paths
that back up or absolute paths that aren't the same.  There's no
general way to CWD up a directory or to go back to the FTP root other
than to break the connection and re-establish it.  (Unless you want to
be highly UNIX-centric, which I hope everyone agrees is a bad idea.)
Leaving it open is not an unreasonable optimization for fetching items
from the same directory or subdirectories.

Strangely enough, I discovered the past history of public annotations
*after* I developed my HyperNews concept a few months ago.  Turns out
to be much the same thing.  See HyperNews at:

I've also been collecting links to related collaboration projects

Included in the latter are some references to old discussions on

We've been experimenting with a modified server and client that deal with 
a header like this :

	Pragma: keep-connection

This allows both parties to take full advantage of Content-Length headers
and to gracefully recover from closed connections or variable length
timeouts based on current load considerations. For same site transactions,
which are pretty typical, there are significant performance gains 
available within the current protocol framework.

RFC 959 does include an optional 'CDUP' command to
change to the parent directory.  I don't know how many 
non-Unix servers support it, though I seem to recall 
it working on at least one Mac FTP server I've talked to.

Then again, even CDUP won't work in all cases (e.g., 
multiple symbolic links to a directory.)

When the user selects an audio (WAV) file under Mosaic from our

for the Windows audio player to be displayed. The user must then click
for the audio to actually be played.

Do you know of any way to make this more transparent and have Mosaic

fm2html
================================
Norwegian Telecom Research has a filter that is available via ftp. All
rights to the filter belong to Norwegian Telecom Research. The filter
can be modified as long as the top lines of each source file indicating
the original source of the filter is kept. The would also appreciate
being sent information about bugs, bug fixes, etc.
 
The filter can be found at the following ftp site.
 
        ftp bang.nta.no
 
Login as anonymous and cd to the pub directory the tar file is named
fm2html*.tar.Z.
 
This filter has not been tested by Frame Technology Corporation and we
in no way support it.
 
 
This is an excerpt from a README file, provided by the author:
 
        Frame 2 Html filter, version 0.8.1, 24th November 19993
        ====================================================
 
This filter has been made as part of my work at Norwegian Telecom
Research.  All rights to the filter belong to Norwegian Telecom
Research.  The filter can be modified as long as the top lines of each
source file indicating the original source of the filter is kept. We
would also appriciate being sent information about bugs, bug fixes,
etc.
 
The current version of the filter:
 
o Handles frame files and books.
o Is customable, through a tags file mapping frame tags to logical tags
  used by the filter.
o All frame X-refs become html links.
o An index is automatically generated based on chapter headings in the frame documents.
o The file structure of the frame document is kept in the html
  document. Single frame files become single html files. Frame books

  become multiple html files, one html file for each frame file.
  FrameMaker generated files are removed.
o Graphics and maths are separated to files, which are then translated
  to postscript and ultimately gif.
o Tables are handled through the <pre> html tag.
o Italics and bold parts of paragraphs are handled.
 
Problems and bugs:
 
 o Characters in frame not in html, including Greek character.
 o Documents that are divided into sections using the FrameMaker 'frame'.
 o FrameMaker documents which do not use tags and operate on text directly.
 o Very large pictures are not handled well (bigger than an A4).
 o Only anchored frames are handled well. Other graphics may be lost.
 
This program was made for internal use only. I will try to make it portable,
but it is not unlikely that a few paths have to be changed.

This program requires additional executable software, not provided nor supported

 MIF2HTML
================================
 
MIF2HTML, the MIF to HTML Converter, was designed to provide users with an
easy to use interface for converting existing Frame documents to HTML documents
suitable for use with the World Wide Web (WWW) and GWHIS, Quadralay's
online, context-sensitive help system. It allows developers to create
documentation within Frame's Maker application and then simply convert those
files for use on WWW servers. This allows for a single set of documentation to
be maintained for both printed and hypertext usage.
 
In order to make use of the MIF to HTML Converter, you will need to have Frame's
fmbatch program in your execution path or you will need to have already
converted existing Frame documents to MIF documents (Maker Interchange Format).
 
If you have GWHIS Viewer already installed on your system, double-clicking on
an HTML document will automatically launch the GWHIS Viewer if it is not
already loaded and display the selected HTML file. Future versions of
MIF2HTML will support a similar method for displaying Frame and MIF
documents from within Frame's Maker application.
 
 
Currently, MIF2HTML supports conversion of Frame paragraph and character
formats, graphics files embedded by reference, and Frame marker tags. Any Frame
tags not explicitly mapped will be translated as regular HTML text.
 
Frame paragraph and character formats are mapped by the user to equivalent HTML
constructs.
 
The converter automatically translates graphics files imported by reference to
the <img src="???.gif"> constuct used by GWHIS Viewer and Mosaic.
Quite simply, it removes any extension on the existing reference filename and
appends .gif to the end. You will still need to create the corresponding GIF
files yourself using either a graphics editor or file translation software.
 
Frame marker tags are supported for translation, but only to HTML's
<a>...</a> construct. By supporting markers in this way, users can specify
HyperText links in Frame that span multiple words or lines when translated to
HTML. The first marker inserted can be either a standard Frame marker or a user
defined marker, but it must include the href information needed by HTML. An
example appears below...
 
 
A second marker would be inserted into the Frame document where the hypertext
link is to end. During translation, you would assign the first marker to map to
<a> and the second to </a>. The href information is automatically inserted.

This has been a topic I've been pondering for quite awhile.  My main 
interest started as a "killer" usenet interface for the web, but I quickly
realized that this'd mesh nicely with a public annotation scheme.

I'm actually on holiday now, so I won't yet go into my ideas, but if my
new job actually firms up, I'll present my system in September.

Subject: Wav file and Mosaic client
content-length: 971

The last question that I asked concerning Mosaic's use with WWW, one
person responded that it was the wrong forum and "take it elsewhere"
which I was certainly prepared to do --- then many other folks
responded to the question with useful answers.

So now I'm confused -- incluse Mosaic (or Lynx) questions or not. I'd
like some further direction (I would juts as soon have all questions
here and have mail readers sort them out) but I'll respond certainly
to the wishes of the majority.
*********************************************************************


In the meantime, another question about Mosaic and a .WAV file:

On a client system, running Mosaic version 3.2 and utilizing Win32,
EMMS386 and Windows Enhanced Mode on a 12MB Ram machine, the system
says that 80% of the systems resources are free. Yet a 3MB .WAV file,
when selected, "insists" on loading to the hard disk first before
going into RAM -- a very slow process!!.

Any ideas will be appreciated.

Hi Nigel -

I thought someone at Bull was offering Internet consultancy services.  Have you  
tried them for this information?

How can white space be included in URL's in such a way that

servers frequently have Mac-type folder names, which can
have spaces in them.  How does one specify an URL to access
such a folder?  Thanks.

Subject: inet-marketing hypermail-like archive up
content-length: 1207

I've added the Internet marketing list discussion to my hypermail-like
archive.  After brief internal debate, I put it in the hierarchy under
"Network social-legal issues." ;-)

Here's the alias to go directly to the inet-marketing menus.  The name of
the alias will be stable; the internal filename (which you'll get if you
navigate my menu tree) is not guaranteed to be stable, though it usually
will be:

<URL:http://asearch.mccmedia.com/inet-marketing.html>

I've set up similar aliases for www-talk, MacHTTP-talk, Web4Lib,
www-security and www-html (though it is having almost no traffic).  Just
add ".html" after the list name, as in the URL above.  Not directly related
to the Web, I also have EFF-activists and PACS-L on my system, with similar
aliases.

There is a buglet that's causing some HREFs to fail to be added to the last
reply link or two.  I'm trying to track it down, but it's not following any
kind of pattern that I can detect.  When I force it to re-do the page
generation, it always works.  Ah, prototypes.

Subject: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT in HTTP/WWW
content-length: 1521

Recently I posted in one of the www NetNews groups a RFS (Request For Status
:-) on some stuff I had read about collaborative computing features such as
check-in and check-out being considered for integration into the WWW
architecture.  Some responses I received indicated that these are/were under
consideration for the next generation of HTTP, but current leaning is to NOT
include them, and that this new HTTP spec was being discussed here.

We are already using Mosaic/WWW to provide access to internal information and
documentation.  It would be nice to be able to use the SAME interface for
actual retrieval, annotation/updating, and depositing of documentation, as one
might do in a development project.  So, I'd like to cast a vote in favor of
considering keeping these around.

I understand there may be technical reasons why this is difficult,
philosophical reasons why it shouldn't be done, and it is probably an issue of
priority (I can't expect the good folks at CERN and NCSA to meet ALL my needs
for the amount of money I pay them :-).    If anybody could point me at past
discussions of this topic, or summarize them (in private email is fine, I'll
summarize back to the list), I'd appreciate it.  (Is this mail list in a WAIS
archive somewhere? I was hoping I'd get auto-mailed a FAQ with such info in it
when I subscribed to the list :-}

Neat idea! I suggest a refinement to select a rectangle from an image:

	<IMG SRC="image-file#x,y,width,height">

e.g.

	<IMG SRC="chemistry-font.gif#100,0,15,6">

Perhaps it's wise to use named, rather than positional, parameters, so
that somebody could pass font metric data too:


	<IMG SRC="chemistry-font.gif#x=100;y=0;w=15;h=6;baseline=22;kern=0.6">

This is one of the good reasons for having multipart messages:
Problems with it are:
  no browsers support it
  servers don't support it
  You can't send multiple requests at once.  

However, it would be nice if the server were smart enough to understand 
'compound objects' like pages: 
   THis is an HTML page and these are the GIFs that go along with it,
   served as a Multipart msg:  HTML, gif, gif, gif

Unfortunately this doesn't work too well (doesn't allow client side cache,
what if I'm using a text-only browser).  

A nicer method would be to allow multiple GETs within a request.
(or have I missed something) - so
   1. get page
   2. figure out which components need to be fetched. (modulo cached objs)
   3. issue one request for all these objects
   4. Receive one multipart mesg.

This should shorten retrieval considerably since the biggest problem with
current multiple imgs is that they depend on separate HTTP connects and
the setup time for each new HTTP connect is rather large (especially
when compared to the time to blast over the 2048 bytes of data for an icon).

So - any chance of this becoming useful?

> >each image by it's image number (e.g. <IMG SRC="icons.gif#3> would mean
> >the third image in icons.gif).

Eeek - where would this info be stored?
GIF does not support named sections.  
Who would be doing the extraction - the server?  
That doesn't fix anything: call setup time will still bite you.
The client?
Time to extract info from large gif would be small compared to 
multiple GETs.  However, it is (IMHO) a worse solution than multiple
distinct messages.

WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
Ignoring for the moment the fact that no fonts are distributed as gifs,
and that gifs are stupid way of distributing fonts, _what_ would this do?

Cause subsequent text to be rendered in this font (if possible?)
Cause the font to be displayed on the screen?  Install the font on
your system???  

Ick no! HTML should not be about sending bitmaps around, but about
sending _information_.  If I wanted you to have a bitmap, I would
have used a fax...

[Sorry... I took a thread from the www-speed list and cross-posted
it to www-talk. I gues I didn't give enough background while I
was at it.]

Yes... a compound document architecture would do the world a lot
of good. But it's complex and messy. In the mean time, doing
multiple HTTP transactions over one TCP connection is a cheap
hack with big potential win.

Just try looking at this another way:

	1. Client opens connection to Server
	2. Client sends request for page, with Pragma: keep-connection
	3. Server sends HTML, but doensn't close the connection
	4. Client examines HTML, finds a number of IMG SRC=...
	5. Client sends a request to get each IMG over the same
		connection
	6. Server responds to each request as usual, except without
		closing the connection
	7. Client closes the connection.

Rather than multiple GETs in a request, we try multiple requests
in one TCP session. Hmmm... a lot of headers get repeated.
Perhaps this is what simon was saying about Accept: headers.

Looks like it, as soon as somebody codes it up!

No, the client. But I agree that GIF doesn't have any "packaging"
info. Hence the rectangle hack. It's kinda like the way
Windows toolbar icons are done...

Ah... but consider a collection of 1000 chemistry documents that
have little alpha's and beta's all over them. A client downloads
chemistry-font.xbm once, and caches it for the whole session.

Ok... so use xbm, or any other bitmap format. I don't care. The point
is that you can GET one image with a whole bunch of glyphs in it.

No, no, no. It's used just like IMG SRC=... is used, for example,
by the LaTeX2HTML translation tools -- to incorporate little images
into the flow of text as a hack for characters that are not part
of HTML.

Yes, it is hard to move a browser base.  Something I haven't seen 
discussed is the proxy aspect.  Although proxy servers constitute a very 
small portion of the GETs, they likewise constitute a more-easily 
upgraded installed base.  And with the developments in the proxy 
community, the percentage of traffic from them will go up.

So, why not think in terms of applying these ideas to server-server 
transactions?  Seems to make things much easier to implement.

Interesting take - we are currently hacking away at Mosaic (and cursing
the code) and see the problems in trying to move clients on to this.
At the same time the server hacker (me) is breezing through it - no
motif widgets, no hassles etc.

Also: clients will not support a feature until servers do - otherwise
it is useless.  I think this has been NCSA's strength - since they have
both the client and server sides wrapped up.

How common are proxies (having never seen one myself)?

I'm running CERN's 3.0pre6 here in proxy mode.  It's fantastic, 
especially since I have a dialup connection.

Maybe someone on the www-proxy list could jump in and explain the cache 
manager concept and server-server communications.

In steps 3 and 4, how does the client know
where the end of the document is?  This seems
like the primary obstacle to multi-transaction HTTP.

I can see a couple of options:

1) Use the Content-Length: header.   This may
place an extra strain on servers, especially for
objects that are generated on the fly like CGI 
script outputs.

2) Use an encoding with an explicit ending delimiter, say
message/rfc822 in base64.  (OK, bad idea.)

3) Define a new content-transfer-encoding based on
tag-length-value packets; clients would examine the
tag field to determine which packet was the last
one in the transaction, and the server wouldn't need
to determine the total message length beforehand.

Servers should also be able to close the connection 
asynchronously (in case of a timeout or other reasons.)

If multi-transaction HTTP does get implememnted, shouldn't
it have a different version number?  HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/SESSION?

There is something similar to this in the EIT/CommerceNet SHTTP spec
that is worth looking at.  The idea of several encapsulated requests
mirrors what you are saying.  (and yes - the redundant headers become 
annoying - maybe they can be moved into the enclosing MULTIPART ?

How about downloading each char once and caching each char separately?
Lots of initial up front costs, but doable now...

<Img src=/chem/alpha.gif><img src=/chem/omega.gif>  etc.

Well - no!
This is a general problem - how to distribute font info reliably.
Postscript is one answer - except it isn't used by any rendering
system except the NeXT.  ATM fonts are ok - but X and most Macs
don't deal.  Fonts are a problem.  PDF tries to deal with it, but
isn't widespread (yet).

Ok - I see your point about sending over one bitmap and then indexing into
it - however, as you also say - moving clients over is a hassle.

The best bet would be to put each char in a separate bitmap (ie:
one img per character) - So the initial loading cost is high, but
falls as the client cache kicks in.  Plus: It works now - no changes.

Now if multiple gets per connection were fixed - it still works, but
faster.

Now if someone can implement better font rendering hints into HTML
and the browsers, we're much better off...

Proxying is one way around the installed base; another cute hack is to use
a special magic prefix in an ordinary HTTP URL- for example, one could use
URLs of the form <http://foo.com/_fhttp/frotz.html>, as well as dedicated 
urls like <fhttp://foo.com/frotz.html>. 

Legacy browsers would connect to the http port and send the url as given;
fhttp aware browsers would try connecting to the fhttp port first. This
would give full backward compatibility, and would also give a strong incentive
for people to upgrade. If Super-Muzak from Muzak Communications
works ten times faster than Square-Muzak from Sprout, the folks at Sprout are
going to have a big incentive to get the faster protocol into their next
release...

Not to put words in anyone's mouth, but did Mr. Jones mean support for
the GIF 89a file format of multiple images per file ?  Although I like Mr.
Connolly's area-based fragment idea, too......someday when httpd supports
fragment access in general.....

X11R6 includes Display PostScript.

BTW, what are the differences between ATM fonts and PostScript fonts?

True, but 3 is not a name but a number. 

GIF 87 and GIF89 both support multiple images per file. Code to extract 
the n'th image of a GIF is availavle in, for example, the xanim package 
I believe.

However, it is true that the multi-image functionality is not widely 
used, and some common tools (ie XV) do not support it.

And I agree that this is a particular and partial solution to the more 
general problem of reducing the page completion time by, for example,  
multipart sends and requests.

Well, its difficult to see how the Web is expected to support
collaborative computing if it doesn't even have simple lock mechanisms.

OK, I can see the point, perhaps. If a list of locked nodes is
maintained by the server then a form of session management is taking place,
and this is contary to the stateless server notion. However, I hope we are
not going to eridicate such basic features simply to remove all
statefulness from the servers.

that collaborative computing (including collaborative authoring) was an issue

Hi -

Can anybody recommend a table of latin character codes to display non-US  
characters in HTML?  (ie. with as much browser-independence as possible).

Thanks in advance,

Is it possible to trigger multiple ftp's from a single hotlink? Is there an
HTML ftp syntax for this or could anyone suggest a work around?

NCSA httpd will compile straight out of the box for Solaris 2.3 (well
almost... there are a few changes to be made to the Makefile in the src
directory but these are documented within this file).

I used gcc-2.5.8 although Sun's acc also works well.

By request (and because it made sense to me) I've added www-speed to my
hypermail-like archive.

The alias to the top menu is like the others I announced:
<URL:http://asearch.mccmedia.com/www-speed.html>.

I keep calling this "hypermail-like" because what I'm really building is
what I call a "Virtual Forum" focused on the net and information
publishing/libraries.  But many of the ingredients of the Virtual Forum are
still to come... ;-)

The most recent four weeks or so of messages will be available via the
menus; the rest will be full-text searchable.

When I receive the older messages, I'll add them to the system, but for now
the archive starts with yesterday's.

Subject: Proposal -- Foldable Anchor Inclusion for HTML 3.0
content-length: 5781


Please forgive me for posting this to www-talk, but I can't
get on www-html and it has been low traffic lately anyway.
Besides, I believe this is relevant to the emerging discussion
of annotations here.

This proposal is available as
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/torrance/papers/foldable.html

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Proposal -- Foldable Anchor Inclusion</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<H1>Proposal -- Foldable Anchor Inclusion</H1>

This is a proposal to add a new folding capability to HTML 3.0 by
adding a new value for the EFFECT attribute of an 'A' element.  (for
background on EFFECT please consult <a
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_14.html">
the relevant part of the HTML+ spec</a>).
The proposed new value is <b>Indent</b> or <b>Foldable</b> or
<b>Fold</b> (in decending order of my preference).  It means that the
retrieved document should be rendered in place within the current
document, indented one level (the width of this indentation would be a
browser preference).  Foldable tags within the new subdocument should
be indented even further when they are unfolded, producing a natural
outline structure.  This capability represents a sort of
user-controlled client-side include mechanism which is similar to the
way images are now included by user-click in some web browsers for
Macs and PCs with slow net connections.  Note that this proposal is
backward-compatible with HTML 2.0, since browsers that don't
understand the EFFECT tag would just display the foldable item as a
normal link.

<h2>Refolding</h2>

Browsers which support this should be expected to provide a way to
"refold" a subdocument which had been "unfolded", thereby returning to
a shorter displayed document.  Note that the browser history is not
enough; I may retrieve a document with A and B folded, then unfold A,
unfold B, then finally refold A; this is a new state I haven't seen
before in my window history.  

<h2>Why Put This Property on the Anchor?</h2>

Many documents may stand on their own right, and may also be
appropriate for indented inclusion in other documents.  It's not
really a property of the included document whether it's appropriate
for inclusion, but a choice that should be made by the author of the
including document when authoring the anchor.

<h2>Why Indent?</h2>

The point of the indentation is to indicate the extent of the
subdocument.  This could be indicated instead by changebars, by
different background colors in the client, or by a closing hrule.
Perhaps <b>NoIndent</b> should be an alternative EFFECT?

<h2>Title</h2>

The included documents will usually have a title, which the user
probably wants to see.  I suggest that browsers show the title only if
it is at all different from the link text that led to the included
document.  This is because that link text will still be on the display
at the top of the title.  I would suggest that other information from
the included document's head (if any), such as links, be displayed in
the subdocument's extent just as they are normally shown at the top
(or bottom) of the primary document.

<h2>Client / User-Interface Implementation</h2>

One model for how to display this is the Macintosh System 7 triangles
placed to the left of foldable items.  These look like '&gt;' when
something is folded, and 'V' when it is unfolded.  This model is nice
because it would allow the link text to be separately active as a
hotlink to visit the document on its own page (or in a new window per
browser preference or user mouse-button-choice).  An alternative is to
have the link active in a special way, so that it toggles whether its
subdocument is folded.  This has the disadvantage that it changes the
semantics of a link that might look similar to other links, so the
appearance should probably be different (different color or bold
underline, for example).  I prefer the former (triangle)
implementation, or some other symbol if Apple has the triangle
copyrighted or the mechanism patented.

<h2>Annotations</h2>

This mechanism would provide good support for displaying annotations
in the context of the original document, where the annotations were
also documents in their own right (and thus could be themselves
annotated, etc.)  Note that the annotations *could* be referenced in
the original document, or they could be applied on the server side by
a program that uses a comment map to include them after appropriate
paragraphs, or they could be retrieved by a client from a separate
annotation server and displayed conditionally based on user
preferences and/or group permissions.  In any case, the folding
in-context display capability will be useful whether annotations
appear in the middle of a document or at its end.

<h2>Other Uses</h2>

This folding mechanism would also be useful for code browsers and
taxonomy browsers, where the subdocument is computed by running a
script or program or doing a database query.  Finally, this may be a
good way to present long structured documents as folded tables of
contents.  In fact, certain clients may choose to offer a "folded"
view of a standard HTML document that uses existing HTML document tag
structure to fold sections under their headings, paragraphs under
their first lines, HTML+ figures under their captions, etc.  This
"folded view" capability is independent of the proposed change to the
HTML 3.0 spec, but would be value-added that could leverage off the
browser programming that implements compliance with the proposed
attribute addition.

<h2>Comments</h2>

I invite comments on this proposal to be posted to the www-html
mailing list or mailed to me at <a

Under MS Windows 3.1, this can be done -- it is used by the 
GhostScript/GhostView combination to provide a nicer user interface under 
Windows 3.1 than the raw GhostScript interface.  From examining the Win32 
API help file, it looks like this method should work under NT and Chicago 
also.  It should be noted that only USER objects are global (window handles 
et. al.); GDI handles are private to each task.

Why should this even be part of a W3A standard at all? It seems like something
the HTML browser itself should handle.

I'm working on a modularized WWW client, and handle this situation like so:
The html browser has it's own 'registry', a mapping of URLs to windows. When
a document comes in, it looks in the registry; if there, it sends the document
to that particular window. Otherwise, it creates a new window.

Similarly, if you want a particular URL to appear in a particular window, you
have to register it beforehand. No big deal; it's fairly simple code.

This seems more modular than having a window parameter passed on (IMHO, of
course.)

I haven't seen TOO much discussion on HTTP here (is there another mailing 
list for this?  I can't even find the HTTP/1.1 spec...) but looking at the
1.0 spec at CERN indicates there are alreadyt proposed methods "CHECKIN"
and "CHECKOUT", though no server nor browser implements it as far as I can
tell (though I'm considering using it for an internal publishing system 
I'm specing out).

Just like RCS or SCCS.  It's a *necessary* thing when you have a 
valuable body of documents maintained by numerous people.  I was 
really happy to find it already suggested in the protocol.

There's a hypermail archive at 
http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html
and Nick Arnett's similar archive which I have embarrassingly lost the
URL to.

I don't know how much the CHECKIN/OUT methods were discussed, but not a
whole lot was talked about the LINK method, which I'm looking at very
closely....

Perhaps it would be wise to use an existing font format rather than 
inventing a specific hack on an image format.

application/x-bdf

springs to mind, using the documented binary distribution format. So you 
get all the characters of one font in one file, without having to carve 
up an image. Plus you get and encoding vector and kerning info, too.

Agreed.

Not so, O NeXT-centric one ;-) PostScript Type 1 fonts can be used by X11R5 and 
up systems that have the IBM contributed Type 1 rasteriser built in. Admittedly, 
few do. There are also some GNU font utilities though I have not used them 
myself. Or did you mean sending the entire document as PostScript? In which 
case, workstations from Sun, SGI, DEC, IBM etc all have Display PostScript built 
in. Inline EPS anyone? [Note HP workstations are a notable omission from that 
list, the only major workstation manufacturer not to provide DPS.]

An advantage of distributing scalable fonts is of course that you get all the 
sizes of that font. Sending bitmapped fonts that look OK on, say, a 640 by 480 
PC screen look pretty odd on a 1280 by 1024 workstation screen, or when you 
choose a different sized set of fonts next week.

Sigh. 'ATM' fonts *are* PostScript Type 1 fonts

Trouble with this is, html file 1 from site A references /chars/alpha.xbm
and this goes in your cache. Then, later, html file 2 from site B 
references /fonts/Alpha.gif and you go and fetch that, and so on...

If a single URL was used, sites without a proxy cache would see 
tremendous slowdown due to the bottleneck referencing a single site. 
URIs URNs or whatever may offer some help in the 22nd century, but 
until then ... grin

The solution for the application areas that have been under discussion 
is, of course, HTML 3.1, assuming it has enough expressive power to 
handle a single inline alpha as well as a fullblown displayed equation.

But the problem then reappears for music notation, astrological symbols,
warning icons ad anything else that doesn't fall under mathematical 
notation. So we still need to solve it, I guess.

Thanks to the following for the unanimous answer:


John Labovitz <johnl@ora.com>
miked@CERF.NET (Michael A. Dolan)
mueller@sc.ZIB-Berlin.DE (Peter Mueller)
lilley@v5.cgu.mcc.ac.uk (Chris Lilley, Computer Graphics Unit)

Whitespace (and other non-printing characters) can be represented with
hexadecimal equivalents, preceded by the '%' sign.  This, an URL with
"foo bar" in it would be something like:

ftp://hostname/pub/foo%20bar

In my particular case, unfortunately, version 2.1.0 of "Peter's Macintosh
FTP" server refuses such URL's.

Subject: POSTing (from mosaic for X)
content-length: 1745


Speaking of CHECKIN/CHECKOUT, there is a huge space of applications
that would be enabled if the popular web browsers had some way of
grabbing a local file and POSTing it to a server.

So after waiting over a year for it to magically appear, I just
built a variation of Mosaic for X 2.4 that can post local files.
The diffs are really pretty minor, and all #ifdef'd.  If the
interest in this outweights the flames, I'll post 'em.  I'd
love for this mod to catch on (I can't imagine I'm the only one
dying for this capability.)

The easiest way would have been to add a "Post Local File..."
option to the File menu, but in an attempt to head off all those
pages saying "Now, choose the Post Local File option and type
the following URL into the box..." I did it by adding POSTing ability
to anchors.

That is, the <A> tag in my version can take a method=POST
attribute ala the <FORM> tag.  The semantics of this is that the
browser is supposed to determine an appropriate body and POST it
to the HREF instead of doing a GET.  My version gets the body by
popping up a file-system-browsing dialog box, and reading the
selected file.

Of course, the server side already supports such POSTing in the
sense that it is straightforward to write CGI programs that handle
POSTs.

With this in hand, I prototyped a document translation service that
solicits such POSTing of word-processed documents, and returns an
HTML version.  (Please don't ask to see/use it yet!)

Data processing services, they're the future!

Subject:       Some general questions!
Priority: normal
X-Mailer:     Pegasus Mail v3.1 (R1a)
content-length: 1841

Here at the University of Massachusetts/Boston, the Healey Library is 
planning on installing a MOSIAC server on the WWW.  Before I 
undertake on this project I have some general questions and would 
appreciate your comments/thoughts/opinions, etc.  If this is not the 
correct place to address these questions, please could you point me 
to correct LISTSERV! - Thank-you

SCENARIO:
     The library has a collection of several thousand photographs
     listed/indexed under various subject categories - which the
     library would like OPENED for general viewing.  There is 
     limited text associated with each photograph.
     
Q1. Once these photographs/images are scanned onto the MOSIAC server,
    is it possible for other MOSIAC (client) sites to COPY or
    REPRODUCE these images.  The issue here is one of COPYRIGHT 
    violations.  I guess I would like to know how other institutions 
    are handling the copyright issues?
    
Q2. What would you recommend in terms of hardware for housing these
    several thousand photographs?  Does MOSIAC run better on a UNIX
    or MAC box?  Any recommendations for the harware configuration?
    
Q3. Is there a special type of INTERNET (SLIP/PPP) connection that I 
    should request for as opposed to one that is used for a GOPHER?
    

Thank-you for your help and pardon the ignorance.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Hypermail in C, version 1.0
content-length: 1684


	*Hypermail* is a program that takes a file of mail messages in
UNIX mailbox format and generates a set of cross-referenced HTML documents.
Each file that is created represents a separate message in the mail archive
and contains links to other articles, so that the entire archive can be
browsed in a number of ways by following links.
	Hypermail was originally written in Common Lisp and has been
completely rewritten in C.
	Here's some of what Hypermail can do:

	* Hypermail archives can be updated incrementally by one article
	* Archives and articles can be taken from standard input
	* Archives indexes sorted by date received, thread, subject,
	  and author are automatically generated
	* "Next:", "Previous:", "In reply to:", and "Next in thread:"
	  links in articles are automatically generated
	* URL references in articles are converted to hyperlinks
	* Email addresses are converted to hyperlinks - these links can go
	  to mailto: or a custom-defined program
	* Using the <html> tag, HTML passages in articles can be marked
	  so they can be parsed
	* Hypermail can take settings from a configuration file and/or
	  environment options

	The source code comes with a man page, HTML documentation, and a
CGI mail gateway program that can be used with Hypermail.
	The latest documentation can be found at:

	http://www.eit.com/software/hypermail/hypermail.html

	You can FTP Hypermail from:

	ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/web.software/hypermail

	A binary for SunOS 4.1.3 is available at the site.

	Enjoy!

I was wondering if this idea could be used to make
MPEG or quicktime video clips havew multiple links inside them
or would it make the size of the clips too great for ease of use...


ie..video displays walking down a garden path ..
panning past various trees and shrubs...point and click on
the Tree in "frame n" and you are hotlinked to say a description
of the tree....maybe even nest them further...ie click on the leaves and 
see more....click on the blight on the leaves and meet "fungus x".....

I think I would want the video to pause while the folded documents were 
unfolded 

or maybe  make them taggable for later retreival and more in depth study


Has anyone done this sort of thing allready....
The closest thing i can remember ever seeing was the _pop_up science and 
nature books i had as a child 


It sounds very complicated to acheive though....
   sort of like what I saw on tv ...Silcon graphics  worksataions trying to 
make Tom Hanks talk to President Kennedy....but then again linking 
anchors to video may be  simple as
digitally selecting  and making a simple color change to a peice of 
clothing to run throught he clip...

I gave the new inet-marketing discussion list a try, but I found its
moderator's policies to be a bit oppressive.  I've dropped out of that list
and  removed the inet-marketing archive from my Web server.

Is there another list or something where there's *open* discussion of these
issues?  All suggestions are welcome.

Please don't misinterpret this as an attack on the moderator.  I just
disagree, strongly, with his policies.  The great thing about the net is

I'm curious -- in the past month or so, I've seen mention of W3O and
HTML 2.0, but I'm still not clear on what they are or what their status
is.  W3O seems to be some kind of new standards organization that's sprung
up, and I can't figure out if HTML 2.0 is a supplanting of HTML+, of
who's status I am also unclear.  If anyone could clue me in, I would
be greatly appreciative.

Thanks,

I found it!
On this very mail server in fact, is a treasuretrove of tidbits about the
coming WWWO.

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Organization/Consortium/W3OSignature.html

It includes the initial press release and a prospectus/working notes on W3O.

In response to your second question:
W3O will help hammer out the HTML3.0 standards, as well as the other
protocols and common code libraries in use on the web.

If I remember: HTML 1.0 was the initial CERN stuff
               HTML 2.0 is whatever Mosaic implements (sort of)
               HTML 3.0 is what used to be HTML+ (i.e: big and far off)

Which Web browsers/clients support the "no_proxy" environment
variable for specifying domains for which the CERN proxy httpd
server should not be consulted?  CERN's documentation simply
says "some clients support" it.

Thanks.

NCSA HTTP runs as well under Solais 2.3 as it does anywhere else :-)

The only changes you might need to make is to change the size of the listen
queue from 5 to whatever value you've set tcp_conn_req_max to. This only 
really matters if you're serving a moderate volume.

Are many people using JPEG in conjunction with WWW/Mosaic and, if
so, has it made a marked speed improvement. Also does anyone know
the site where the most current JPEG compression and uncompression
versions are available?
Thanks,

	Subject: POSTing (from mosaic for X)

	Speaking of CHECKIN/CHECKOUT, there is a huge space of applications
	that would be enabled if the popular web browsers had some way of
	grabbing a local file and POSTing it to a server.

Related to this, I think it would be a good idea for browsers to support
POSTing of attributes contained in the same anchor.  This would avoid
passing arbitrarily long command lines to cgi scripts which is unsafe
as well as hard to read.  I've suggested this a couple times before
in newsgroups., but it didn't catch on, so I try again as a followup to
your idea.

	That is, the <A> tag in my version can take a method=POST
	attribute ala the <FORM> tag.  The semantics of this is that the
	browser is supposed to determine an appropriate body and POST it
	to the HREF instead of doing a GET.  My version gets the body by
	popping up a file-system-browsing dialog box, and reading the
	selected file.

My idea is that with method=POST in an anchor, all the other attributes
of the anchor would be passed to the cgi script as standard input, just
as if it were the action of a FORM.  This would be useful when a
generated html document encodes information in the document that
should be passed back to the server when the anchor is selected.  This
can be done now using extra path and query string options, as well as
command line arguments, but again, this can be unsafe and hard to read.

To support both your idea and mine, there would have to be some
additional option to select between input from a file and input from
the attributes.

We've had some discussions about how to get clients to be able to post
files. I think the conclusion is that it is more useful for "input a
file" to be a variation of INPUT rather than a variation of a tag.
This keeps the method orthogonal from the kinds of things that might
be submitted, and also allows for practice such as asking for more
than one file.

Eliminate "SCRIBBLE" and "AUDIO" from the 'proposed':

<FORM ACTION="url" ENCTYPE="multipart/x-www-form-data"
      METHOD="POST">
<p>Say a few words:    
   <INPUT NAME="voice" TYPE="audio/*" MODE="interactive">
</FORM>

Would be a form that would interactively ask you to talk into the
microphone.

<FORM ACTION="url" ENCTYPE="multipart/x-www-form-data"
      METHOD="POST">
<p>Supply an audio or image file:
     <INPUT name="data" type="audio/* image/*" MODE="file">
</form>

would be a form that would prompt you to select a .au or .gif or .jpeg
or etc. image file.

Additional advantages are that it would allow the file dialog to
self-select only certain types of files.

I don't know whether application/x-multimedia-tar or
multipart/x-www-form-data or something else is the right type for the
ENCTYPE of the form, though.

There is no such thing as a Mosaic server. There is a web server, which can 
recieve requests from any web client. Mosaic is one such client, there are a 
number of others.

> is it possible for other MOSIAC (client) sites to COPY or
>    REPRODUCE these images.

Yes. They already have copied them, from your server machine to their client 
machine.

You will need to consider to what extent you are willing to compromise the 
quality of the photos you provide access to in order that they are not of 
magazine publishable quality, trading this off against the reduced usefulness of 
low grade pictures to legitimate users of your archive.

One possibility is to go from an index to a page per photo with a small inline 
GIF, the text, a link to a larger JPG and a link to a form. The form has a 
copyright agreement, entry fields for name, adress, affiliation etc saying that 
this person agrees to these copyright conditions. Submitting the form logs the 
details and sends back a high resolution 24 bit TIFF of the photo.

Until scribble input or other digital signatures become available, the agreement 
would probably not stand up in court. However, it would give pause for thought 
and serve to prevent blatant copying of your materials.

You will need a copyright statement on or leading of from your front page. This 
needs to spell out exactly what can (eg, downloading for viewing) and cannot 
(eg, republication without written authorisation) be done with these images.

A reasonably nippy hard disk. Depends on your anticipated traffic.

> Does MOSIAC run better on a UNIX
>    or MAC box?

As this is part of your Q2 I assume you are asking here about the Web server 
rather than the web client. In general, Unix boxes are faster than Macs. They 
also run a true multitasking operating system which makes it easier for them to 
accept many incomming connections at once. Of course, you do get quite powerful 
Macs (PowerMacs) and quite slow unix boxes (68000, 386 PC).

>Q3. Is there a special type of INTERNET (SLIP/PPP) connection that I 
>    should request for as opposed to one that is used for a GOPHER?

No, just an ordinary internet connection will be fine. That said, if you are 
sending out many large images over a slow line, you will have problems. Check 
that your bandwidth is acceptable for your intended usage. If you intend running 
an image archive over a SLIP connectioin I would imagine you will have problems.

This is not about HTTP per se, but since it sprang up in the
discussion:

Chris Lilley:

 |The solution for the application areas that have been under discussion 
 |is, of course, HTML 3.1, assuming it has enough expressive power to 
 |handle a single inline alpha as well as a fullblown displayed equation.

What Chris is saying, is, I think: for symbols and other
character-like images, there is a better solution than trying to get
all images with one HTTP request: use entities instead of images. He
mentions HTML 3.1, but HTML 3.0 already started on this course.

 |But the problem then reappears for music notation, astrological symbols,
 |warning icons ad anything else that doesn't fall under mathematical 
 |notation. So we still need to solve it, I guess.

Just like there are entity sets for accented characters, publishing
symbols and mathematical symbols, we should define additional sets of
`standard' symbols.

HTML 3.0 already defines typical WWW symbols, like `binary file', `tar
file', `telnet' and `caution'.  The symbols are are partly based on an
ISO proposal for `desktop icons' (ISO/IEC CD 11581).

Using entities(*) is IMHO the way forward. No matter how efficient
the HTTP request is made, it will always be more efficient to use

	&scales;

instead of

	<img src="astrological/signs.gif#4">

or whatever. And it has several other advantages as well, for example,
it is independent of resolution, color, and style (how about
<b>&scales;</b>?)

Of course, there will remain some symbols that are not worth
standardizing, since they are unlikely to be used again. Any method is
good enough for those.

So what symbols sets could be defined?

  - ISO entity sets, including ISOnum, ISOpub, ISOtech, etc.
  - `WWW' set (or whatever we call it) already defined in HTML 3.0
  - musical symbols
  - architectural symbols
  - astrological symbols
  - pointing hands
  - traffic signs
  - etc.

Agreeing on them is the difficult part. Implementing can't be that
hard. Apart from long tables of entities, all that's needed is that
someone creates a font for them.

---------
*) Erik Naggum argued on comp.text.sgml that it would make more sense
to standardize the SDATA replacement text than the entity names.
Something to think about for when HTML x.0 starts to allow general
entities.

  - viewers are tied to Content-Type
  - a particular instance of a viewer for a particular document is
    tied to a particular window (the instance is discarded afterwards)
  - the browser deals out screen space (rectangular areas within the
    boundaries of which viewer instances can do what they want)

Steve, you seem to suggest that :

  - there is only one viewer instance, which handles all docs of a
    particular type (you say `URL' but that can't be right)
  - its single window is registered with the browser by some means
    outside of the program (you say `HTML browser', don't you mean
    `WWW browser'?)

How can this deal with, for example:

  - simultaneous display of two documents of the same type
  - in-lined material

Sorry, I took the original question to mean -- does anyone know where
to find a copy of the httpd server that runs on SCO UNIX?

Is my understanding correct?

I have a similar model in mind; when a document is recieved, it is sent out
to different modules depending on the content type. So anything with a type
of 'text/html' would be sent to the HTML browser, one with 'image/gif' would
be sent to a GIF viewer, etc.

The HTML browsing module consists of two parts: a dispatcher and one or more 
viewers. The dispatcher has a mapping table associated with it; when a document
comes in, it looks in the table to see which viewer that document should be
sent to. If there is an entry, it sends the document there; otherwise it
creates a new viewer. Here is part of the code:

	url_index={}

	def Register(url, callback):
		url_index[url]=callback

	def Display(url, name, (file, header)):
		data = getdata(file)
		if url in url_index.keys():
			showurl = url_index[url]
			del url_index[url]
			showurl(name,data, file, header)
		else:
			window = HTMLWindow()
			window.showurl(name, data, file, header)

	RegisterExtension(('html','text'), Display)
	RegisterContentType(('text/html','text/plain'), Display)

When 'Display' is called, it checks the index to see if the document's
URL (HREF? I'm not sure of the correct terminology) has been registered; if
so, it sends the document to that window. Otherwise, it creates a new window
and sends the document there.

Of course, this requires that a document's URL be registered if you want it
to appear in the same window.

Sorry; wrong word. Content types are linked to a particular module which 
handles
it; there may be multiple content types that can be displayed with a particular
module. 

>   - its single window is registered with the browser by some means
>     outside of the program (you say `HTML browser', don't you mean

There can be multiple windows. I'm not sure whether the correct terminology
is "HTML browser" or "WWW browser"; I'm referring specifically to a browser
which displays HTML (and text/plain, but that isn't important to the topic
at hand.)

>    - in-lined material

If you mean tags like <IMG SRC=...>, the model allows you to specify a callback
when the document has been retrieved, instead of the normal handling. (This
is how downloading is implemented; the document is requested with a callback
saving the data on disk instead of trying to create a viewer for it.)

Hope this helps,

Steve

Well copyright is kind of a sticky question here.  It is impossible for 
any client to present an image to the user without copying the image.
Once the client has the copy, it is impossible to prevent the client
from saving and/or reproducing the image.  So, to make the collection
available for viewing you must allow copying.  

So, what do you do?  Simply, you must rely on the honesty of the viewer.
You must make it crystal clear on all the image pages that the images are
copyright protected.  The simplest method would be to have an anchor 
at the top of each page that links back to a full copyright page.  

On the copyright page you should spell out in no uncertain terms that the
entire collection and every image in it is under copyright protection and
that the images may be viewed but not saved, copied for use other than 
viewing, or reproduced.  You should allow copies for viewing kept locally, 
otherwise you could open a whole can of worms regarding caching.  Or if that
is not acceptable you could modify your sevrer to always set the expires date
so that the images are never cached. 

Like libraries everywhere, the user is responsible for not violating the law.

	I find it in my browsing.   Don't use it myself. 
It probably speeds up the transfer substantially,  but viewing a 
JPEG has always been slower for me then viewing a GIF.   Can Mosaic 
handle JPEG for inlines?   I hadn't thought so.   (another reason 
why I've been avoiding it)

	Having also read Larry's response,  in which I think he 
made some really excellent recommendations,  your wording makes me 
think of adding  "attributes"  or other parameters in the URL itself. 
What I mean is,  explore/exploit the syntax: 
 
	type://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][;parm;parm;...][?args] 
 
	This is going in the other direction,  but it works. 
We use a subset of this syntax in our interface to our problem 
tracking system where some state must be retained from one transaction 
to the next.   In this case,  the  path  is usually constant,  referring 
to the same script.   [sorry if this is just a rehash for everyone] 
The  "parm"  values could be  "var=val"  pairs.   (they're not for us) 
That separator could be ampersand;  I've seen commas and semicolons.

	This is worth discussing,  whether we embrace it in full 
or not.   I don't mean to nix it with the alternative method above.

Agreed, except for your assumption that we need to choose one best way
to POST.  There are certainly multiple ways to do a GET.

My suggestion for method=POST anchors should be judged on
its own merits.  That is, does it make sense from an HTML 2.0 standpoint?
Seems to, as it is similar to the use of FORM method=POST.  Is is easy
to implement in browsers?  I've satisfied myself that it is via the
Mosaic X mods.  Is it easy to implement in servers?  Yes, it is easy
to write CGI programs that accept it.  Does it enable interesting and
important new applications?  YES!

Having said that, I would be happy to abandon my approach if there is
activity on a practical alternative.

If the idea is that people must PAY to obtain copyright permission, but
that you want them to be able to look to decide what they are willing to
buy, solutions can be had by allowing browsers to view (and of necessity
copy) low resolution versions of the more valuable high-resolution files
for sale.

If, on the other hand, the idea is that you want to be able to let people
have a look at the high quality images, but you do not want them copied,
then as noted below there aren't many options except counting on the
honesty of the users.  Letting folks have at your copyrighted visual via
Mosaic (or similar systems) is equivalent to turning people loose in a
library full of copyrighted material with free photo copiers, VCRs,
cassett recorders, available at every turn.

Yes, that's come up here too, but it's low on my priority list because,
as you said, you can stuff the HREF attribute.  (In fact, one of my
test applications POSTs a file *and* stuffs form attributes into the
HREF.)

Yes, I'd been thinking about a source=ask attribute along with method=POST,
if for no other reason than to make the procedure for getting the file
more explicit.  There could also be a source=inline attribute to do what
you want.

Though I'm hesitant to support your idea of "all other attributes of the
anchor would be passed [as form attributes]" -- that would lead to
anchors that break when new anchor attributes are implemented in browsers,
anchors that can't pass form attributes named by reserved words like HREF,
and really frustrate DTD developers.  Better to slap them into one or
more formatt="lastname=Weber" attributes, for example.

And btw, you'd have to add an ENCTYPE attribute.

     Windows Mosaic currently doesn't support direct WAIS interface without 
     going through a proxy server.  Is that true and if so, any suggestions

Might we want to consider a new header line that can express the fact
that something is copyrighted and the terms under which it can be
copied?

For example consider the following in a document header:

  Copyright:  Sherman Oakes, 1994
  Copyright-terms: User may make up to 50 additional copies.
  Copyright-cost: $0.10 per additional copy
  Copyright-payment-to: Copyright Clearance Center

These lines could be formally structured to make them comprehensible
to the user's viewer.

This is what LINK is designed for: <LINK REL="copyright" HREF="...">.  If
you need additional structure for the data you can define a standard
data format and assign it a MIME type (e.g., application/x-copyright).
Servers can then automatically detect client support for that format via
the HTTP Accept: attributes.

Also, HTML LINK attributes can be exported to the HTTP header using WWW-Link:

Hmmm... I just took a look at the html documents and I can't find
anything that makes such a strong claim about either the meaning of
LINK or REL.  If you have one handy, I'd appreciate it if you would
pass me a URL that might explain things a bit more clearly.  Thanks.
(I was looking at the documents descending from
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html)

Personally, I don't really care how it is expressed as long as the user
(or his/her/its) viewer can know that they are about to fetch copyrighted
documents or what happens if they make further copies of things that
they have fetched.

I'd like it in the headers so the client can read it using a HEAD.  It's nice
to know, or at least, to be able to know, before transfering the document
itself.

                 THE INTERNET AND THE ANTI-NET

         Two public internetworks are better than one

                        by Nick Arnett

     Networking policy debates tend to paint a future monolithic
internetwork that will follow consistent policies despite a number of
independent operators.  Although that's how the interstate highway and
telephone systems -- favorite metaphors for network futurists -- operate,
historical comparisons suggest that it is probably not what the future
holds.  Two distinct, interconnected publicly accessible digital
internetworks are likely to emerge, which is surely better than just one.

     One of the future internetworks will grow out of today's Internet,
whose roots are in the technology and scientific/academic communities,
funded by government, institutions and increasingly, corporate and
individual users.  Although the Internet will support commercial services,
they rarely will depend on advertising.  The other great internetwork will
grow out of the technology and mass communications industries, especially
cable and broadcast industries.  The "Anti-net" will rely on advertising
revenue to recoup the cost of the infrastructure necessary to create cheap,
high-speed bandwidth.  (I call this second network the Anti-net not to be a
demagogue but to make a historical allusion, explained shortly.)  All three
communities -- technology, science and academia, and mass media -- will
participate in many joint projects.  The most successful new ventures often
will arise from three-way collaborations; skills of each are essential to
create and deliver network-based information products and services.

     The Internet community reacts with profound anger and resentment at
Anti-net behavior on the Internet -- in net-speak, "spamming" advertising
messages into hundreds of discussions.  The outrage is based in part on the
idealistic traditions of academic and scientific freedom of thought and
debate, but there's more behind it.  Anger and resentment fueled by the
world's love-hate relationship with the mass media, particularly
television, surface in many other contexts.  Nearly everyone in the modern
world and large segments of the third world watches television; nearly all
think broadcast television is stupid, offering a homogenized,
sensationalized point of view that serves advertising interests above all
others.  In competition with television's hypnotic powers, or perhaps
simply due to the high cost of distribution, other mass media have followed
suit.

     Idealistic defenders of the Internet's purity believe they are waging
a humanitarian or even a holy war that pits a democracy of ideas against
the mass media's empty promises and indulgences.  Television and its kin
offer the false idols and communities of soaps, sitcoms and sports.  The
mass media tantalize with suggestions of healing, wealth, popularity and
advertising's other blessings and temptations.  Internet idealists even
question the U.S. administration's unclear proposal of an "information
superhighway," suspecting that the masses will be taxed only to further
expand the Anti-net's stranglehold on information.

     The same kind of stage was set 500 years ago.  The convergence of
inexpensive printing and inexpensive paper began to loosen the Roman
Catholic church's centuries-old stranglehold on cultural information.  The
church's rise to power centuries earlier had followed the arrival of the
Dark Ages, caused in Marshall McLuhan's analysis by the loss of papyrus
supplies.  The church quickly became the best customer of many of the early
printer-publishers, but not to disseminate information, only to make money.
The earliest dated publication of Johann Gutenberg himself was a "papal
indulgence" to raise money for the church's defense against the Turk
invasions.  Indulgences were papers sold to the common folk to pay for the
Pope's remission of their sins, a sort of insurance against the wrath of
God.  Indulgences had been sold by the church since the 11th century, but
shortly after the arrival of printing, the pope expanded the market
considerably by extending indulgences to include souls in purgatory.
Indulgence revenue was shared with government officials, becoming almost a
form of state and holy taxation.  The money financed the church's holy
wars, as well as church officials' luxurious lifestyles.

     Jumping on the new technology for corrupt purposes, the church had
sown the seeds of its own undoing.  The church had the same sort of
love-hate relationship with common people and government that the mass
media have today.  The spark for the 15th-century "flame war," in
net-speak, was a monk, Martin Luther.  Outraged by the depth of the
church's corruption, Luther wrote a series of short theses in 1517,
questioning indulgences, papal infallibility, Latin-only Bibles and
services, and other authoritarian, self-serving church practices.  Although
Luther had previously written similar theses, something different happened
to the 95 that he nailed to the church door in Wittenburg.  Printers -- the
"hackers" of their day, poking about the geographic network of church doors
and libraries -- found Luther's theses.

     As an academic, Luther enjoyed a certain amount of freedom to raise
potentially heretical arguments against church practice.  Nailing his
theses to the Wittenburg door was a standard way to distribute information
to his academic community for discussion, much like putting a research
paper on an Internet server today.  In Luther's time, intellectual property
laws hadn't even been contemplated, so his papers were fair game for
publication (as today's Internet postings often seem to be, to the dismay
of many).  Luther's ideas quickly became the talk of Europe.  Heresy sells,
especially when the questioned authority is corrupt.  But the speed of
printing technology caught many by surprise.  Even Luther, defending
himself before the pope, was at a loss to explain how so many had been
influenced so fast.

     Luther's initial goal was to reform the church.  But his ideas were
rejected and he was excommunicated by his order, the pope and the emperor,
convincing Luther that the Antichrist was in charge in Rome.  Abandoning
attempts at reform, but accepting Biblical prophecy, Luther resisted the
utopian goal of removing the Antichrist from the papacy.  Instead, as a
pacifist, he focused on teaching and preaching his views of true
Christianity.  Luther believed that he could make the world a better place
by countering the angst and insecurity caused by the Antichrist, not that
he could save it by his own powers.

     Luther's philosophy would serve the Internet's utopians well,
especially those who believe that the Internet's economy of ideas untainted
by advertising must "win" over the mass media's Anti-net ideas.  The
Internet's incredibly low cost of distribution almost assures that it will
remain free of advertising-based commerce.  Nonetheless, if lobbying by
network idealists succeeds in derailing or co-opting efforts to build an
advertising-based internetwork, then surely commercial interests will
conspire with government officials to destroy or perhaps worse, to take
over the Internet by political and economic means.  Historians, instead of
comparing the Internet to the U.S. Interstate highway system's success, may
compare it with the near-destruction of the nation's railroad and trolley
infrastructure by corrupt businesses with interests in automobiles and
trucking.

     The printing press and cheap paper did not lead to widespread literacy
in Europe; that event awaited the wealth created by the Industrial
Revolution and the need for educated factory workers.  Printing
technology's immediate and profound effect was the destruction of the
self-serving, homogenized point of view of a single institution.  Although
today's mass media don't claim divine inspiration, they are no less
homogenized and at least as self-serving.  The people drown in information
overload, but one point of view is barely discernable from another,
ironically encouraging polarization of issues.

     Richard Butler, Australia's ambassador to the United Nations, draws
the most disturbing analogy of all.  Butler, a leader in disarmament,
compares the church's actions to the nuclear weapons industry's
unwillingness to come under public scrutiny.  Like the church and its
Bible, physicists argued that their subject was too difficult for lay
people.  Medieval popes sold salvation; physicists sold destruction.
Neither was questioned until information began to move more freely.  The
political power of nuclear weapons has begun to fall in part due to the
role of the Internet and fax communications in the dissolution of the
Soviet Union.

     The truly influential and successful early publishers, such as Aldus
Manutius, were merchant technologists who formed collaborations with the
scientific/academic community and even the church, especially those who
dissented against Rome.  Out of business needs for economies of scale, they
brought together people with diverse points of view and created books that
appealed to diverse communities.  The Renaissance was propelled in part by
books that allowed geniuses such as Copernicus to easily compare and
contrast the many points of view of his predecessors, reaching
world-changing conclusions.

     Today we are at a turning point.  We are leaving behind a world
dominated by easy, audiovisual, sensational, advertising-based media,
beginning a future in which the mass media's power will be diluted by the
low cost of distribution of many other points of view.  Using the Internet
is still something like trying to learn from the pre-Gutenberg libraries,
in which manuscripts were chained to tables and there were no standards for
organization and structure.  But like the mendicant scholars of those days,
today's "mendicant sysops," especially on the Internet, are doing much of
the work of organization in exchange for free access to information.

     Today, the great opportunity is not to make copies of theses on the
digital church doors.  It is to build electronic magazines, newspapers,
books, newsletters, libraries and other collections that organize and

Something that uses more explicit language what a "relationship" means
between documents.  It is a very vague term.  I wouldn't have guessed
in a hundred years that it could pertain to copyright.  Besides if one
looks up the currently defined registrations for REL, not any of the
eighteen or so listed types includes any mention of copyright.

In other words, I don't agree that the issue is clear.  I don't see
any standardized vehicle for a publisher of a document to express
copyright except in human language or as an attached human language
document.

The Internet is already thousands of distinct networks, all interconnected
(public and private).  There are even many commercial networks in that bunch.

So, while the history of the printing press is very interesting you failed
to differentiate your scheme from what we already have.

> cable and broadcast industries.  The "Anti-net" will rely on advertising
But if they are interconnected then what is to prevent the advertisements
from going to the non-commercial Internet?  The commercial customers that
do the spamming, post to the non-commercial resources on purpose because
they can get away with it; that is the problem.  If they would stick to
their own playgrounds then I think everyone would be happy now.

The best solution I see is simply for service providers to write appropriate
use policy into their contracts and filter out packets from providers with
unacceptable policy or enforcement.  Unsolicited email or advertising in
non-business areas should be part of that policy--spamming should be the
death penality (i.e., being disconnected and/or paying severe penalties).
I have no problem with commercial use, but I do have a problem with misuse
(commercial and non-commercial) and I believe that it is the right and
responsibility of the service providers to deal with it.

Most importantly though, the rules of the game must be clearly written.

What is (or should be) the relationship between SGML entities and
URNs? If we had a URN system, would we use URNs for naming the various
WWW symbols?

Read what you quoted.  I wrote says two "internetworks," not two networks.
And the essay doesn't talk about commercial vs. non-commercial, it talks
about advertising-based vs. non-advertising based.

That last sentence is exactly my point... except that everyone will never

Relationship is not being used in any special or obscure way.  The LINK
relationships are purposefully open-ended so that you can add things like
copyright that weren't orig in the spec.  If you want more explicit
language then you'll have to write it because I don't think it exists.

Isn't it cool the way that works.

I never said there was; I said, and I quote:
    If you need additional structure for the data you can define a standard
    data format and assign it a MIME type (e.g., application/x-copyright).

I mearly told you how to associate this data (in any format you desire)
with the document in question.

I hadn't thought of that, but it's an exciting idea! But I would turn
the second sentence around: many entities are sort of standardized by
the SGML standard, I think they count as URNs.

Some thought needs to go into resolving the words `sort of' above. For
example, the entities are only standard in certain contexts. By mixing
SGML and URL conventions, we could say that an entity reference like
`&eacute;' is really a `partial URN', which expands to:

	ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN#eacute

If we agree on sets of additional entities, we could treat them the
same way, except that the public identifier would be different, e.g.:

	-//WWW//ENTITIES WWW standard icons//EN#folder

The question remains: what does the URN reference? The way the
standard entities are used in SGML, they refer only to an abstract
idea, usually a glyph. Depending on the application the abstract glyph
can be turned into dots of ink, sound, a character code in some
charset, etc.

Viewing standard entities as URNs wouldn't change anything in the
browsers, of course. A browser that accidentally tries to do a GET on
such a URN would receive a placeholder, just as the entity definitions
in the SGML standard are just placeholders.


Bert

PS. There would be related URNs that *do* point to real data, such as
the URNs that link to fonts for printing the glyphs.

We've done this for a customized solution, but there are problems
for implementing this generically.

Security is the main issue. i.e. there is nothing stopping people
writing html docs with dangerous commands as their ACTION field.

One of our new products has a well known browser(dare I say it... Mosaic)
built into it as help engine/WWW navigator. We needed this local
form processing capability. So we have restricted this to only
allow calls to 'safe' binaries shipped with the products.

However I don't see this as a good solution, it was the best fit
for the timescales we were working to. To tackle the generic solution
we first of all need to define what the aims of local processing
are.  I think we should be using local processing in a way that
does not involve filesystem access if we want security. The processing
could be done via a scripting language within the HTML document.

e.g. If the user selects two list items, a third item is set automatically.

The scripting language could allow return of an HTML doc created
on the fly, or via a URL ref. So you could reference things on your
CD based system.

This is an interesting area of discussion, I know the HTML 2/3/x authors 
must be addressing it.

Hi all,

I know this has been covered by this group on many occasions, (and I have read 
up on what was said :), but we are hitting the age old problem of how to index 
a web space.

The thing is that we are looking at possibly taking things one step further 
than that though. Let me try and explain....

Finally at long last Brunel is looking at taking its Campus Wide Information 
Service (how I hate that term since we now have 3 campuses!) from being a 
research area to a fully fledged production type service. This is involving the 
creation of a large ammount of HTML very quickly. For this work we basically 
decided that the only way that we could effectivly do this was raw HTML since 
we are talking about probably 50 pages of HTML in around 25 working days to 
effectivly produce the "core" of the service and some example departmental 
pages. This is a very short term solution.

All is going well so far (including the Biology department being one of the 1st 
to activly join in). However we are going to soon have to start introducing and 
maintaining a medium term approach.

What we would like to see is a way to tailor the way that a user sees the web 
space here (also variable on whether the user is internal or external!) at the 
same time as trying to introduce control over document revision and authorship.

Having looked around this brings a few questions to mind:

1) Is raw HTML the best approach for documents? I know that it is definatly the 
best approach for transmitting them in this case but would some on the fly 
conversion (being careful to send Expires and Last-modified headers) be better? 
People have already started raising doubts here as to how easy it is to 
maintain a HTML file so what I am really asking I guess is does anyone have any 
expirence in this and if so what have they found/done about it.

2) There are 5 key bits of information about the document that we have 
identified, that are a requirement for some form of centralised searching or 
indexing:

	a)* Document title
	b)  Keywords associated with the document	
	c)  Short Description of the Document
	d)* Document author
	e)  Document owner

The ones marked with a * should be displayed when the document is viewed, the 
ones that arent should at least be in the document somehow. Is this a valid use 
of the META tags? Or are there other methods we could use. If we went outside 
HTML and accepted that we could convert back to HTML on the fly, (see question 
1) what other markup language could we use. (I say markup language because I 
think that say correctly annotated word processor files are NOT the way to go 
here).

3) In question 2, I identified the document owner and author as being 2 quite 
separate people. Aswell as this we foresee a position where both may be dynamic 
over time. Actually I see the following situation:

	Owner's name/contact is dynamic
	Author's contact is dynamic
	Author's name is static

So what schemes have people come up with for this. My initial feeling is that 
it could be represented as something like:

<P>Contact details for the <A HREF="./1234.html">Author</A> and <A 
HREF="./4321.html">Owner</A> of this page</P>

Which although would be clumsy would allow for details to change without 
needing to revise 70 or so documents. Again, would using a higher level of 
markup and producing HTML pages on the fly help to avoid this problem?

4) Finally, on searching the web space, have there been any advances in this 
recently? People here seem to be against the ALIWEB style approach to indexing. 
What other methods are people looking at?

I think that covers a lot of the holding points at the moment (except that we 
still can't get sgmls to work correctly - but we are working on it :) Any 
comments on this topic are appreciated,

Cheers,

Paul

Yes, agreed, there are a lot of known security holes, BUT NONE if your

the LOCAL perl-script to handle the *LOCAL* "request"!

  I'm wide open to suggestions on how to implement the local execution.
I just put this support in because it was something Mosaic had that I

Yes fine, but your's is only one instance of a number of types
of situations where local form processing is needed. Why don't
we look at a generic solution rather than discussing a quick hack for
your problem ?

See above. If you are really desparate then here goes...

invent a new method e.g. LOCALPOST
in the submit button callback, verify that you want LOCALPOST
Call your local processing stuff for this case

Again I do not recommend this. We need to standardize on an
agreed general solution.

If we have local (doc side) scripting

  - you can still access all your files from your server
  - process them as need be with your scripting language
  - create 'on the fly' docs with your scripting language

If you actually want to execute a process on the client side that
is specified by what is written in a document then the system is
open for abuse and you base your model on that of trust.

How many sites are going to go for that ??

Can your processing not be done within the document via the scheme
proposed ?

Does anyone know which of the new flavours of HTML plan to
solve this type of problem or not as the case may be ?

No problem.  I'll just do it my way.  You will do it yours.  Fred will do
it yet another way.

And we will end up with chaos.

OK, since I'm free to invent a method I will:

Inventing...

1. One can't put the copyright (and the ancillary copyright use
information) into the document itself because it may not be text.

2. One can't put the copyright into the link because anybody can create a link.

3. That leaves only the wrapper that the server generates when it sends
the document.

4. I want the client to have the option to preview the copyright
information before actually fetching the document, so the information needs
to be available by the HEAD operation.

5. Information that needs to be conveyed to express the copyright:
   a) owner and date
   b) terms (i.e. the license) under which the user can view and possibly
      further copy the document.
   c) fees (possibly many classes depending on the status of the user)
   d) agent for collection of the fees

Now the issue is how to express this information in a way that both
people and computers can comprehend.  Also the server builders will
need to find a mechanism to allow the publishers of documents to
express this stuff (which will probably fit just fine with other
things not yet done, like per-document expiration data.)

Subject: Indexing of WWW space (going one higher than HTML)?

Hi all,

I know this has been covered by this group on many occasions, (and I have read
up on what was said :), but we are hitting the age old problem of how to index
a web space.

The thing is that we are looking at possibly taking things one step further
than that though. Let me try and explain....

Finally at long last Brunel is looking at taking its Campus Wide Information
Service (how I hate that term since we now have 3 campuses!) from being a
research area to a fully fledged production type service. This is involving the
creation of a large ammount of HTML very quickly. For this work we basically
decided that the only way that we could effectivly do this was raw HTML since
we are talking about probably 50 pages of HTML in around 25 working days to
effectivly produce the "core" of the service and some example departmental
pages. This is a very short term solution.

All is going well so far (including the Biology department being one of the 1st
to activly join in). However we are going to soon have to start introducing and
maintaining a medium term approach.

What we would like to see is a way to tailor the way that a user sees the web
space here (also variable on whether the user is internal or external!) at the
same time as trying to introduce control over document revision and authorship.

Having looked around this brings a few questions to mind:

1) Is raw HTML the best approach for documents? I know that it is definatly the
best approach for transmitting them in this case but would some on the fly
conversion (being careful to send Expires and Last-modified headers) be better?
People have already started raising doubts here as to how easy it is to
maintain a HTML file so what I am really asking I guess is does anyone have any
expirence in this and if so what have they found/done about it.

2) There are 5 key bits of information about the document that we have
identified, that are a requirement for some form of centralised searching or
indexing:

        a)* Document title
        b)  Keywords associated with the document
        c)  Short Description of the Document
        d)* Document author
        e)  Document owner

The ones marked with a * should be displayed when the document is viewed, the
ones that arent should at least be in the document somehow. Is this a valid use
of the META tags? Or are there other methods we could use. If we went outside

There seems to be two approaches to letting browsers invoke
scripts locally:

        a) Only allow execution of trusted scripts

        b) Provide a safe environment for execution
           of non-trusted scripts

You can provide trusted scripts in a number of ways:

        i)  A set of trusted programs in a local
            read-only directory

        ii) Scripts signed securely by trusted parties

The latter will have to wait until Secure HTTP takes off.

I am proposing a standard API for non-trusted scripts for
HTML fill-out forms. This will probably appear in HTML 3.1.

I think 

    x-exec://programname/foo/bar/baz?blort

is a very poor choice for URL syntax. I'm hoping that the initial "//"
will be used by URL schemes to denote DNS A-record fully qualified
domain names. (E.g., so that, if you know that mtv.com is now known as
adam-curry.org, you can uniformly modify URLs scheme://mtv.com/ to
point at the new host name.)

In this particular case, there is absolutely no reason to use //. 
How about just

    x-exec:progname;foo;bar;baz

That's why the registration of a MIME type (which would probably be
more of a "license" than a "copyright", but whatever) would be a
useful way to standardize it.  Such a system should be generalizable,
of course; if it only works with HTTP and HTML it's not very useful.

At least in the forseeable future, one will have to put the copyright
in some form into the document itself because browsers may not show
the viewer headers or links or other tags.

>2. One can't put the copyright into the link because anybody can create a link

This is dependent on how things are configured.  It would be quite
trivial to design things so that not just anybody can create a link
with the relationship value of "copyright."

Where link information may be contained, among other things.  This
also has the advantage of allowing non-HTML objects to have copyright
information.  Of course, it should also be possible for documents fed
via FTP or other methods to employ this representation.

Useful.  Some people may wish to dink with access authorization such
that people must POST a statement to the effect that "I have read and
agree to the terms blah blah" or other various fun legal stuff.

And potentially other stuff, which may grow arbitrarily complex and
arbitrarily large.  Do we really want big documents like the GPL or
whatever other licenses will be used being passed around in HTTP
headers?  No, we just want to pass around pointers to them.  Much more
efficient, as well as more general.

This sounds reasonable to me.  Document title is pretty obvious.  The
document maintainer is often represented by <LINK REV=made
HREF=mailto:somebody> tags (the word "made" suggests "author" but the
use suggests "maintainer"... that probably should be fixed.  IAFA/IIIR
distinguishes the two as "author" and "admin".)

Use of META tags like this is already happening; for instance, the
site-index script <http://www.ai.mit.edu/tools/site-index.html> or my
variant of it <http://www.cs.indiana.edu/item_index/intro.html>.  It
seems reasonable.

What you describe above (making things like keywords and descriptions
of documents available) sounds very much like ALIWEB.  Can you be more
specific about what they seem to be against?  Use of document-specific
data like keywords?  Expectation of sites to locally construct an
index which is polled?  Lack of hierarchy?  Lack of support for
multiple keyword searches?

I've talked to people who dislike using it, and the reasons usually
boil down to "The link to the UK is slow." :-)

Thanks for your comments.  The following is a fairly long reply because
your questions triggered some ideas.

The model I have in my head is possibly (probably? ;-) different from
yours.

I think of a server which has a published "work", be it a graphic or
text or sound or whatever.  Since not all "work"s can contain an
embedded copyright, my mental model is that the server will somehow
contain an ancillary block of information about the use of that
"work".  When the server sends the "work", the server will make sure to
send the ancillary information as well.

This isn't really so different than what is done today with http in
the object metainformation.

I'm rather wary of having this kind of information stored in another
document and reached by a link because of the chance that the link
will eventually be broken or at the time the link needs to be used,
it's server will be off-line.

Rather, I think that this kind of "right to use" information is of
sufficient importance that it needs to be available at all times
and the best way to do that is to put it in the meta information.

I'm not saying that this is easy.  I would hardly want to put the GNU
copyleft into the meta-information.  (If I did, I would be wrong.  And
I think the copyleft is itself copyrighted with copy/modification
restrictions.)

Whatever we come up with (if anything) ought to occupy no more than a
few lines of meta-header.

I'm trying to figure if there is a way we can come up with some kinds
of classes.  Most of the stuff we have will go under something which
would be classed as "freely available and usable, but don't claim
authorship for yourself" category.

Another class might be "freely available, but distribute no copies"

What I am struggling with at the moment is the distinction between
the original copy being taken and any subsequent copies which may be
made from that first copy.  (I'm thinking [perhaps incorrectly] that
a copy made via a cache is a first-level copy.)

It makes sense to have a URL which points to a license document so
that the user can know what he/she/it is getting into if he/she/it
redistributes.  But I don't think it is realistic that a user is going
to read a license document before getting the first copy.

So I'm thinking of a two tiered meta-information expression:
 - Stuff the client ought to know when taking the first copy.  This
   information should be readily available in complete form in the
   meta information.
 - Stuff the client ought to know if he/she/it wants to use,
   republish, or modify the "work."  This information can be obtained
   via a reference -- there is no need for instantanous access.

Ah another place where, as usual, I didn't really way what I meant.

I was thinking of people putting copyright information in the URL used
to reference a work rather than a link from the work itself.

But your comment did trigger an idea that perhaps an alternative
solution is that publishers of restricted works ought to publish a URL
to a cgi script or something that forces the client to read and agree
to any limitations before passing on "the work".

Agreed, big things need to be handled by reference.  But I think I can
make the argument that most of those sort of heavy licenses really apply
to the copies which you might make to your original copy.  I.e. what
I was calling second tier access.

(And, of course, I'm not dealing with the fact that copyrights and
licenses are handed differently in each jurisdiction.)

Well, you know, the pace of life is slower here :-)

Seriously though, yes, the slow link to my server is a problem. This is
not likely to change significantly in the next year.

If I rewrite the search code (currently a Plexus script) to be a CGI
script, is anyone in the States willing to mirror the database via FTP
and offer a search capability?

Ok, I am interested in these developments. I have a number of
questions which you may or may not have addressed in your future
draft HTML 3.1,

1. What is the aim of the API or put another way what are the requirements
it must fulfil ?

2. Presumably the API will have an entry point via an HTML tag, will
   this lead to some processing via a scripting language ?

3. If you do allow a scripting language are you going 
   - invent your own
   - use an existing language, if so which one ?
   - make it language independent

Yes, that's what we should do but I NEED A HACK NOW because I have to do my work.
My boss sits behind my neck :-) (that was English for Runaways, wasn't it?).
So my priority NOW is to do it (tricky) NOW - but of course I am interested
in solving the problem generally. So what's up with saying

  <form method=GET EXECUTIONPOINT=LOCAL href="file://localhost/THEDIR/theprog">

which means that the only possible execution place ("file://") IS AT YOUR OWN SIDE 
protecting from abuse by third (second?) parties?. 
IF there is no EXECUTIONPOINT, the standard "misbehaviour"
works fine and all will be done exactly as now, and all is ok!
(too blue-eyed???)

So this would be like

??? (can you show a full explained, real working environment?)

Version 0.30 of libwww-perl is now available.

libwww-perl is a library of Perl4 packages which provides a simple
and consistent programming interface to the World-Wide Web.  This
library is being developed as a collaborative effort to assist the
further development of useful WWW clients and tools.

The distribution site and much more information about the libraries
can be found at 

       <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/>

and also at

       <ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/libwww-perl/>


I am looking for more contributions to support the many protocols
and also to provide better HTML libraries.

A mailing list has been established for technical discussion about
libwww-perl, including problem reports, interim fixes, suggestions
for features, and contributions. The mailing list address is 

       libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu

and administrivia (including subscribe requests) should be sent to 

       libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu

A Hypermail Archive of the mailing list is also available at

       <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/archive/>


Changes from version 0.20:

   Added the wwwmailcap.pl library for handling MIME mailcap files,
   www'get_def_header() for reading the default headers, and www'lrequest()
   for doing autoredirected requests (all submitted by Brooks Cutter).
   Removed the default headers from the www'stat() interface.
   Changed the testbot and wwwbot'allowed interface to make use of the 
   default User-Agent header.
   Firmed-up the URL parsing algorithm in wwwurl.pl (particularly relating
   to the parsing of relative URLs) to coincide with the IETF standards
   discussion.  This fixed several potential (but unlikely) bugs and also
   got rid of any "URL:" prefix parsing [finally!].
   Fixed parsing in wwwhtml.pl of href's that had a new-line after the
   quote mark, causing an extra space to precede the extracted URL,
   which in turn created a black hole.  Also added code to extract and change
   the base URL if there exists a <BASE href="..."> element.
   Updated the wording in Artistic.txt to represent a Perl API rather than
   a compiler written in C (as is the Perl distribution).


Have fun,

I have just set up a mailing list to discuss links between MUDS, in
particular systems based on Pavel Curtis's MOO server, and the World Wide
Web. Subjects for discussion include:

* In-MOO clients to access the web.
* Web clients that understand how to talk to MUDs.
* Using the Web to provide Multimedia capabilities to MUDs.

The list is at:

moo-www@maths.tcd.ie

To the person that was referring people to me on this one: thanks, this is
your fault.

Please distribure this announcement to anyone you think might be
interested.

Colman

was wondering if anybody has had any experience/problems with using
NULLSOCK.  I want to use mosaic in a standalone mode so that I can
HTML-tag my textbook for students to use.  However, mosaic almost
doesn't run on my 386-SX and runs fair sometimes on a 486.  Some of the
files are 80K.  Does anyone know about file-size limits and machine-type
requirements and mosaic?

Would appreciate any help anyone can send.

Subject: how about SIGRELOAD?
content-length: 950

what do people think of the idea of a SIG on unix boxes that
would cause a Mosaic or lynx client to do a reload, either of
the current document or of some document that had been
specified (for example, an inlined image)?  The easy way
to do it that I can see is to define a signal to use, and
then have the browser read in the names of the documents
to be reloaded from a dotfile or tmpfile, much the way that
other programs read in from tmpfiles (usually the name of the
tmpfile has the PID of the process in the filename, to avoid
confusion between multiple processes on one machine), and then
have the browser compare the documents with those being displayed
and then reload any documents being displayed and mark as stale
and documents in cache.

i don't read this list directly, but i do keep up with the
archives, so you may want to copy me on any reply mail as the
archives run a little behind.

WinMosaic uses a lot of memory, and the amount used seems to increase drastically 
as the size and/or complexity of the document grows. And yes, running on a 386-SX 
is agonizing. Remember, it _is_ alpha...

Have a look at WinWeb from EINet. Info at:

  http://galaxy.einet.net/EINet/WinWeb/WinWebHome.html

It is small, it is smooth, it is fast, and it is reasonably stable. It does not 
handle forms properly yet, however, but it shows a lot of promise. It's also in 
alpha phase.

Subject: Local "action" of FORMS: AM I TOO STUPID?
content-length: 2316

At first I want to thank all people who tried to help me - and those who WILL do, too, BUT:

I tried and tried and tried but I still have the same problem AND I don't think that
not all of you *NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE* of saying something like:

   '<a href="file://localhost/home/edvs1/fmajewsk/bin/latex2html/A4.dvi">A4.dvi</a>'

   which works FINE: it starts xdvi with A4.dvi, and that's to 
   be expected: ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS!

and the following:
(and now comes the difference!):
  1. my local ".mailcap" *HAS* an entry "application/x-local-csh; csh -f %s"
  2. my local "mime.types" *HAS* an entry "application/x-local-csh      csh"
  3. I use the following FORM (comments are in {}):
----------------------------
  <Head><Title>blablabla</Title></Head>
  <Body><H1>List of Plates using FORMS</H1>

  <hr>
  <a href="file://localhost/home/edvs1/fmajewsk/bin/latex2html/A4.dvi">A4.dvi</a>
{ starts xdvi, WORKS FINE! }
{ now the problem:}

  <Form method=GET action="http://localhost/tmp_mnt/home/edvs1/fmajewsk/PLATES.csh">
  Insert Plate-Nr: <INPUT Name="Plate" VALUE="1" size=3> 
  Choose:
  <select NAME="what">
    <option SELECTED> Temperature
    <option> Salinity
    <option> Potential Density
    <option> Oxygene
  </select>
  Meter:
  <select NAME="selection">
    <option SELECTED> 100
    <OPTION> 200
    <OPTION> 350
    <OPTION> 500
  </select>
  <HR>

  <Input TYPE="submit" VALUE="Show Picture">
  <Input TYPE="reset" VALUE="Erase Choices">
  </Form>
------------------------------------------
  4. I can asure you that I *HAVE* the file "PLATES.csh" in that directory
  5. The only thing I get back is an error message:
     "ERROR
      Requested document (URL
      file://localhost/tmp_mnt/home/edvs1/fmajewsk/PLATES.csh?Plate=1&what=Temperature&selection=100)
     {^^^^
      REPLACED PROTOCOL!}
      could not be accessed.

      The information server either is not accessible or is refusing to serve the document for you.
  6. I use XMosaic 2.4 (and our server-software is CERN httpd 3.0pre5.1)

  7. I also tried 'action="http://127.0.0.1/...." (loopback, should work on any (pseudo-connected) 
     machine, but that produces an ERROR 404...
  8. I tried a few permutations, but - yes, MURPHY seems to stay for some weeks at this side...

I go crazy....

I have added a CGI capability to ALIWEB's form search, which is
working happily under CERN, NCSA and PlexusCGI, in addition to running
as a Plexus module.

I've written up how one can mirror the ALIWEB database, on
<URL:http://web.nexor.co.uk/aliweb/doc/mirroring.html>

To all of you who have expressed an interest in doing this, please
have a look, and if there are any questions either email them to me,
or to the aliweb mailing list.

Hi,

Well there were a fair few responses from the 1st time around so thanks to all 
the people who responded. Unfortunatly (and please dont take this wrong), there 
werent really a lot of answers to what I asked :) So at the risk of being 
repetative, Ill start of with a quick summary and then move on to a few further 
thoughts and questions.

Summary
=======
Well after reading through all those messages it appears to me that a fair few 
people have, are or are about to experience the same problems that we are. And 
that there are really no common grounds for answers. 

On going to a higher level of markup, the only reply specific answer I got on 
this was that maybe we could use some form of word processor and convert down 
to HTML from this. This is fine except that for the amount of information we 
would be looking at this isnt very practical. We have probably in excess of 
2000 documents that would be going up. We really dont have enough disk space to 
keep 2 copies (one word processor/one HTML) so it would need to be done on the 
fly, but that said think of the poor CPU :) Okay so its a hypothetical worst 
case, but thats what I am employed to come up with at the moment.

There also seemed to be mixed views on ALIWEB but more on that in a moment.

Appart from this however there was very little actual answers :) 


Some more thoughts and questions
================================
I talked about wanting to keep certain information in a file that may or may 
not be transparent (author, owner, keywords etc) and the more I think about it 
the more that I can see that people **wont** add this information to the files. 
After all why should they? It wont show up at the page view level so people 
tend look at the wider implications. How can we find a way, without inventing a 
submissions system, to enforce people to use this information.

Im fairly sure now that we will need to come up with our own indexing system. 
Again this is due to the number of documents we are looking it. It would need 
to be able to run on the files themselves rather than the HTTP output, it would 
need to automatically update the files (so the users dont need to run it when 
they add a file in), and as such it must be able to understand how to arrive at 
the URL for the file. Is this do able? I cant see a way unless I can get around 
the problem in the previous paragraph.

(I was going to include my bit on ALIWEB here but I cant access its home page 
right now - timed out - but I think that the above should answer questions as 
to why we think we cant use it here...)

Also there were very few ideas on how to track author and ownership. Does this 
mean that no one has looked at this issue?

I must appologise for trying to push this discussion along but we are currently 
stuck for a lot of answers and the structure we are going to end up with if we 
cant resolve some of these issues is going to be horrendous. (The biology 
skeleton pages went up today on our test server... they didnt really contain 
much information but came in at around 50 pages so Im told. If we have 20 or so 
departments doing this I cant see that we can easily control the structure of 
things AFTER they have happened so we need answers now.)

Thanks for listening, 

Paul

If you can't get people to add the ALT tag for owner, then that is quite 
a pickle!  What are you going to try, a UID<->Name mapping?

I am doing something like that in python.  I am towing the line on the 
Aliweb architecture (more specifically, the IAFA templates), but am using 
my own internal code.  There will still be a site.idx file for Aliweb to 
look at.  More on what I'm doing below.

As of today, it should be fixed.  Martijn is implementing mirrors and 
local search capability.

I have *really* been looking at it.  Here's a snapshot of what I'm doing.

I have a library of classes that implement HTML tags.  These tag 
instances have attributes like owner, which (right now) I am only 
comparing against the REMOTE_HOST.  Then, I have a python CGI script that 
reads in the site.idx file, creating a dictionary of IAFA template types 
(SITEINFO, ORGANIZATION, DOCUMENT, USER, etc.)  Each dictionary value is 
a list of all the templates in the site.idx file that has that 
Template-Type:.

So, I can now send methods to this dictionary object -- search, edit, 
etc.  All HTML is constructed from entity class instances -- the title, 
owner, etc objects go into a head object, the paragraphs, anchors, lists 
go into a body object.  Head and body go into a document object, and I 
then just say document.render(), and out comes a bunch of HTML.

The WWW client that sends it has to match the .owner attribute on 
that object.  This allows remote editing of the templates.  Finally, I 
have a function for printing a site.idx file (conformant to what Aliweb 
is looking for) from the dictionary object in memory.

I'd like to add that the system (without implementing the choices for 
enhancement) is *very* fast.

Sorry, I know this is a lot, but hey, you were lamenting the dearth of 
feedback!

I noted with great interest the article in Personal Computing which
breifly described the advantages of Mosaic.

I downloaded Mosaic-ibm.gz and then downloaded gunzip.exe.

The README file which I downloaded (written by Marc Anderson and Eric
Bina) stated I would then need to "make the binary executable (type,
e.g., 'chmod 755 Mosaic-sun')."

I have attempted to download chmod.exe, which is, I assume, the file I
need to make the Mosaic "gunzipped" file executable, but I am getting
a message which states "cannot save file".  I have tried the
University of Pisa and the University of Manitoba.  I was unable to
locate the file at your site (ncsa.uiuc.edu).

Can you help me?  I now have an 8 meg "unzipped" file, which I am
unable to use.

Thank you for your time and trouble in this matter.

Sincerely (and hopefuuly) yors,

Mark Hoss       hossmc@freenet.fsu.edu

Coercive authoring tools?  Guns?  A smart indexer that divines keywords
by taking short items within <DFN> tags?  (though nobody uses those.)

It's very much doable; I gave you pointers to two different programs that do
exactly that in my previous message.  They probably aren't exactly what you
want, but do what you describe.

Haven't had any trouble accessing it from here.  Anyway, no, the concerns you
describe above do not sound in any way incompatible with something that is
ALIWEB-based.  The ALIWEB paradigm is, in essence:

1. A site prepares a collection of some IAFA templates describing what it has
2. A central indexer polls for that collection and builds an index out of it

What you are asking above is for an effective way to do step 1, unless you
consider IAFA templates unacceptable as a starting point.  Again, you're
not being sufficiently specific about what exactly it is about ALIWEB that
you think makes it entirely inappropriate for your needs.

It is indeed hard to do.  The main constraint is whether the people who
prepare and maintain the information have an interest in making it readily
findable; if so, they'll likely put in the effort to make it findable if given 
an
easy way to do so.  If they don't really care, well, you need either an 
automated
indexer (possible to do, hard to do well, likely to push some of the work of
figuring out how to use it onto the user population) or to hire a LIS student 
to
prepare the index. :-)

    Well, I don't see why I'd want to --- ever.  After all, my Unix box already
stamps the time and date that I edited the thing, plasters my userid on it,
plus has permissions associated with it to show who can edit it.  The server
should be able to generate that (I know that my server already does a stat on
the file before sending).

	It'd be useful if the server took everything (EVERYTHING) that it 
gets from stat() and stuffed that into the HTTP header returned.   But ... 
Dave are you telling me that you don't want to  "sign your work"?   Bad. 
 
	I've already got stuff being cached at multiple sites. 
The UNIX timestamp reflects the cache time,  not the real update time. 
The UNIX owner might very well not be me;  in fact,  I might not have 
an account on the caching/mirroring host.

depends on who `you' are.  the filesystem-level owner of a file is not 
necessarily the author or contact for a file.  in GNN, we have one 
person doing the production work of copying files up to our public 
server.  i doubt she'd want to be considered the `author' of every file...

Subject: POSTing Mosaic patches
content-length: 12131

As promised, here are my patches to NCSA Mosaic for X-Windows version
2.4 that give it the ability to POST files when dereferencing anchors
with method=POST.  This ability is a key enabler in building web
services that translate documents, support collaborative authoring, 
etc.

As I understand the Mosaic license, you are free to grab the 2.4 source
from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, apply these patches (presumably using the patch(1)
command), and try it out.  The patches do modify the top-level Makefile,
in a couple of necessary ways and a couple of ways specific to my
environment.  I'll recommend that you apply the patches and THEN modify
the Makefile to suit your environment.

In a subsequent message I'll include a CGI program that one can
use to test such POSTing.

I received more support than resistance to both modifying HTML 2.0
to include POSTing anchors, and adding something like my patch to
the official releases of NCSA Mosaic.  That's great, but I don't
think there have been enough opinions expressed to bootstrap action.
Please give me feedback on your opinions and commitment to help (or
block!) getting this important capability into the hands of users.

Improvements, extentions welcome!

Jay

Especially when testing my PostMosaic patches, you may be
interested in this CGI C program that reflects the POSTed
document.

It uses the CGI library I announced a couple of weeks ago,
still available as source and binaries in

  ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/wsk/<platform>/libcgi

or you could cut out the frills and compile without it.

0. Abstract

   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the
   syntax and semantics of formalized information for location and
   access of resources on the Internet.

1. Introduction

   The work is derived from concepts introduced by the World-Wide Web
   global information initiative,  whose use of  such objects dates
   from 1990 and is described in "Universal Resource Identifiers in
   WWW", RFC 1630.

   This document was written by the URI working group of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments may be addressed to the editor,
   Tim Berners-Lee <timbl@info.cern.ch>, or to the URI-WG
   <uri@bunyip.com>. Discussions of the group are archived at
   <URL:http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/archive/uri-archive.index.html>

2. Recommendations

   This document describes the syntax for "Uniform Resource Locators"
   (URLs): a compact representation of the location and access method
   for a resource available on the Internet. Just as there are many
   different methods of access to resources, there are several
   _schemes_ for describing the location of such resources.

   The generic syntax provides a framework for new URL schemes to be
   resolved using as yet undefined protocols.

   The syntax is described in two parts. First, we give the syntax
   rules of a completely specified URL; second, we give the rules
   under which parts of the URL may be omitted in a well-defined
   context.

2.1. URL SYNTAX

   URLs are written as follows:

       <scheme>:<scheme-specific-part>

   A the URL contains the name of the scheme being used (<scheme>)
   followed by a colon and then a string (the <scheme-specific-part>)
   whose interpretation depends on the scheme.

   Scheme names consist of lower case letters "a"--"z", digits, and
   the characters plus ("+"), period ("."), and hyphen ("-"). For
   resiliency, programs interpreting URLs should allow upper case
   letters as equivalent to lower case in scheme names (e.g., allow
   "HTTP" as well as "http").

   A BNF description of the URL syntax is given in Section 5.

2.2. Reserved, unsafe, and encoded characters

   URLs are represented as a sequence of characters.  Characters are
   used to represent the 8-bit byte that corresponds to their ASCII
   encoding.
 
   There is a standard way, known as `URL-encoding', to encode bytes
   that are otherwise disallowed: bytes are encoded by representing
   them as a percent sign "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits (0-9,
   A-F).

   In any circumstance, only printable ASCII characters are allowed:
   URLs may not contain space or other non-printable characters. These
   and the character "%" must always be encoded.
   
   Many URL schemes reserve certain characters for a special meaning;
   their appearance in the scheme-specific part of the URL has a
   designated semantics. If it is necessary to designate a byte in a
   component of a URL that would otherwise be represented by a
   reserved character, it is necessary to represent that byte encoded.
   The characters ";", "/", "?", ":", "@", "=" and "&" are the
   characters which may be reserved for special meaning within a
   scheme.  No other characters may be reserved within a scheme.

   Most characters mean the same thing when represented as themselves
   as when represented encoded; however, this is not true for reserved
   characters: encoding a reserved character for a particular scheme
   may change the semantics of a URL.

   There are a number of characters whose use in URLs is _unsafe_;
   characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons.  The characters
   "<" and ">" are unsafe because they are used as the delimiters
   around URLs in free text; the quote mark (""") is used to delimit
   URLs in other systems. The character "#" is unsafe because it is
   used in World Wide Web and in other systems to delimit a URL from a
   fragment identifier that might follow it.  Other characters are
   unsafe because gateways and other transport agents are sometimes
   known to modify such characters. All unsafe characters should
   always be encoded within a URL. For example, the character "#"
   should always be encoded within URLs, even in systems that do not
   normally deal with fragment identifiers, so that if the URL is
   copied into another system that does use fragments it will not be
   necessary to change the URL encoding.
    
   In general, only alphanumerics, reserved characters used for their
   reserved purposes, "$", "-", "_", ".", and "+" are safe and may be
   transmitted unencoded. Even so, safe characters _may_ be encoded
   within the scheme specific part of a URL.

3. Specific Schemes

   The mapping for some existing standard and experimental protocols
   is outlined in the BNF syntax definition.  Notes on particular
   protocols follow. The schemes covered are:

   ftp                     File Transfer protocol
   http                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   gopher                  The Gopher protocol
   mailto                  Electronic mail address
   news                    USENET news
   nntp                    USENET news using NNTP access
   telnet                  Reference to interactive sessions
   wais                    Wide Area Information Servers
   file                    Host-specific file names
   prospero                Prospero Directory Service

   Other schemes may be specified by future specifications. Section 4
   of this document describes how new schemes may be registered, and
   lists some scheme names that are under development.

3.1. Common Internet Scheme Syntax

   While the syntax for the rest of the URL may vary depending on the
   particular scheme selected, URL schemes that involve the direct use
   of an IP-based protocol to a specified host on the Internet use a
   common syntax for the initial part of the scheme-specific data:

        //<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>
        //<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<url-path>

   This initial part starts with a double slash "//" to indicate its
   presence, and continues until the following slash "/", if any.
   Within this section are:

    user
        An optional user name. Some schemes (e.g., ftp) allow the
        specification of a user name.

    password
        An optional password. If present, it follows the user
        name separated from it by a colon.

   The user name (and password), if present, are followed by a
   commercial at-sign "@". Within the user and password field, any
   ":", "@", or "/" must be encoded.

   Note that an empty user name or password is different than no user
   name or password; there is no way to specify a password without
   specifying a user name. E.g., <URL:ftp://@host.com/> has an empty
   user name and no password, <URL:ftp://host.com/> has no user name,
   while <URL:ftp://foo:@host.com/> has a user name of "foo" and an
   empty password.

    host
        The fully qualified domain name of a network host, or its IP
        address as a set of four decimal digits separated by periods. 
        Fully qualified domain names take the form as described in
        Section 3.5 of RFC 1034: a sequence of parts separated by
        period.

    port
        The (optional) port number to connect to. Most schemes
        designate protocols that have a default port number. Another
        port number may optionally be supplied, in decimal, separated
        from the host by a colon.

    url-path
        The rest of the locator consists of data specific to the
        scheme, and is known as the "url-path". It supplies the
        details of how the specified resource can be accessed. Note
        that the "/" between the host (or port) and the url-path is
        NOT part of the url-path.

   The url-path is interpreted in a manner dependent on the scheme
   being used.

3.2. FTP

   The FTP URL scheme is used to designate files and directories on
   Internet hosts accessible using the FTP protocol (RFC959).

   A FTP URL follow the syntax described in Section 3.1.  If :<port>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 21.

3.2.1. FTP Name and Password

   A user name and password may be supplied. If no user name or
   password is supplied and one is requested by the FTP server, the
   conventions for "anonymous" FTP are to be used, as follows:

        The user name "anonymous" is supplied.

        The password is supplied as the Internet e-mail address
        of the end user accessing the resource.

   If the URL supplies a user name but no password, and the remote
   server requests a password, the program interpreting the FTP URL
   should request one from the user.

3.2.2. FTP url-path

   The url-path of a FTP URL has the following syntax:

        <cwd1>/<cwd2>/.../<cwdN>/<name>;type=<typecode>

   Where <cwd1> through <cwdN> and <name> are (possibly encoded)
   strings and <typecode> is one of the characters "a", "i", or "d".

   The url-path is interpreted as a series of FTP commands as follows:

      Each of the <cwd> elements is to be supplied, sequentially, as
      the argument to a CWD (change working directory) command.

      If the typecode is "d", perform a NLST (name list) command with
      <name> as the argument, and interpret the results as a file
      directory listing.

      Otherwise, perform a TYPE command with <typecode> as the
      argument, and then access the file whose name is <name> (for
      example, using the RETR command.)

   Within a name or CWD component, the characters "/" and ";" are
   reserved and must be encoded. The components are decoded prior to
   their use in the FTP protocol.  In particular, if the appropriate
   FTP sequence to access a particular file requires supplying a
   string containing a "/" as an argument to a CWD or RETR command, it
   is necessary to encode each "/" as %2F.

   For example, the URL <URL:ftp://myname@host.dom/%2Fetc/motd> is
   interpreted by FTP-ing to "host.dom", logging in as "myname"
   (prompting for a password if it is asked for), and then executing
   "CWD /etc" and then "RETR motd". This has a different meaning from
   <URL:ftp://myname@host.dom/etc/motd> which would "CWD etc",
   relative to the default directory for "myname", or <URL:ftp:
   //myname@host.dom//etc/motd>, which would "CWD " with a null
   argument and then "RETR motd".

3.2.3. FTP Typecode is Optional

   The entire ;type=<typecode> part of a FTP URL is optional. If it is
   omitted, the client program interpreting the URL must guess the
   appropriate mode to use. In general, the data content type of a
   file can only be guessed from the name, e.g., from the suffix of
   the name; the appropriate type code to be used for transfer of the
   file can then be deduced from the data content of the file.

3.2.4 Hierarchy

   For some file systems, the "/" used to denote the hierarchical
   structure of the URL corresponds to the delimiter used to construct
   a file name hierarchy, and thus, the filename will look similar to
   the URL path. This does NOT mean that the URL is a Unix filename.

3.2.5. Optimization

   Clients accessing resources via FTP may employ additional
   heuristics to optimize the interaction. For some FTP servers, for
   example, it may be reasonable to keep the control connection open
   while accessing multiple URLs from the same server. However, there
   is no common hierarchical model to the FTP protocol, so if a
   directory change command has been given, it is impossible in
   general to deduce what sequence should be given to navigate to
   another directory for a second retrieval, if the paths are
   different.  The only reliable algorithm is to disconnect and
   reestablish the control connection.

3.3. HTTP

   The HTTP URL scheme is used to designate Internet resources
   accessible using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

   The HTTP protocol is specified elsewhere. This specification only
   describes the syntax of HTTP URLs. 

   An HTTP URL takes the form:

      http://<host>:<port>/<path>?<searchpart>

   where <host> and <port> are as described in Section 3.1. If :<port>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 80.  No user name or password is
   allowed.  <path> is an HTTP selector, and <searchpart> is a query
   string. The <path> is optional, as is the <searchpart> and its
   preceding "?". If neither <path> nor <searchpart> is present, the
   "/" may also be omitted.

   Within the <path> and <searchpart> components, "/", ";", "?" are
   reserved.  The "/" character may be used within HTTP to designate a
   hierarchical structure.

3.4. GOPHER

   The Gopher URL scheme is used to designate Internet resources
   accessible using the Gopher protocol.

   The base Gopher protocol is specified in RFC 1436 and supports
   items and collections of items (directories). The Gopher+ protocol
   is a set of upward compatible extensions to the base Gopher
   protocol and is specified in [2]. Gopher+ supports associating
   arbitrary sets of attributes and alternate data representations
   with Gopher items. Gopher URLs accommodate both Gopher and Gopher+
   items and item attributes.

3.4.1. Gopher URL syntax

   A Gopher URL takes the form: 

      gopher://<host>:<port>/<gopher-path>

   where <gopher-path> is one of

       <gophertype><selector>
       <gophertype><selector>%09<search>
       <gophertype><selector>%09<gopher+_string>
       <gophertype><selector>%09<search>%09<gopher+_string>

   If :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 70.  <gophertype> is
   single-character field to denote the Gopher type of the resource to
   which the URL refers. The entire <gopher-path> may also be empty,
   in which case the delimiting "/" is also optional and the
   <gophertype> defaults to "1".

   <selector> is the Gopher selector string.  In the Gopher protocol,
   gopher selector strings are a sequence of 8-bit bytes which may
   contain any characters other than tab, return, or linefeed.  Gopher
   clients specify which item to retrieve by sending the gopher
   selector string to a gopher server.
   
   Within the <gopher-path>, no additional characters have a reserved
   interpretation.

   Note that some gopher <selector> strings begin with a copy of the
   <gophertype> character, in which case that character will occur
   twice consecutively. The gopher selector string may be an empty
   string; this is how gopher clients refer to the top-level directory
   on a gopher server.

3.4.2 Specifying URLs for Gopher Search Engines

   If the URL refers to a search to be submitted to a gopher search
   engine, the selector is followed by an encoded tab (%09) and the
   search string. To submit a search to a gopher search engine, the
   gopher client sends the selector string, a tab, and the search
   string to the gopher server.

3.4.3 URL syntax for Gopher+ items

   URLs for Gopher+ items are have a second encoded tab and a
   gopher+ string. Note that in this case, the %09<search> string must
   be supplied, although the <search> element may be the empty string.

   The <gopher+_string> is used to represent information required for
   retrieval of the Gopher+ item. Gopher+ items may have alternate
   views, arbitrary sets of attributes, and may have electronic forms
   associated with them.

   To retrieve the data associated with a Gopher+ URL, a client will
   connect to the server and send the gopher selector, followed
   optionally by a tab and the search string, followed by a tab and
   the Gopher+ commands.

   More explicitly, if the Gopher+ URL refers to a Gopher search type
   (that is, if the Gopher type is 7), the client sends to the gopher
   server the gopher selector string, followed by a tab, followed the
   search string, followed by a tab, followed by the gopher+ commands.

   If the Gopher+ URL does _not_ refer to a Gopher search (when the
   Gopher type is not 7), the Gopher client sends to the server the
   gopher selector string, followed by a tab, followed by the gopher+
   commands.

3.4.4 Default Gopher+ data representation

   When a Gopher server returns a directory listing to a client, the
   Gopher+ items are tagged with either a "+" (denoting gopher+ items)
   or a "?" (denoting Gopher+ items which have a +ASK form associated 
   with them). A Gopher URL with a Gopher+ string consisting of only 
   a "+" refers to the default view (data representation) of the item 
   while a Gopher+ string containing only a "?" refer to an item with
   a Gopher electronic form associated with it.

3.4.5 Gopher+ items with electronic forms

   Gopher+ items which have a +ASK associated with them (i.e. Gopher+
   items tagged with a "?") require the client to fetch the item's
   +ASK attribute to get the form definition, and then ask the user to
   fill out the form and return the user's responses along with the
   selector string to retrieve the item.  Gopher+ clients know how to
   do this but depend on the "?" tag in the gopher+ item description
   to know when to handle this case. The "?" is used in the Gopher+
   string to be consistent with Gopher+ protocol's use of this symbol.

3.4.6 Gopher+ item attribute collections

   To refer to the Gopher+ attributes of an item, the Gopher URL's 
   Gopher+ string consists of "!" or "$". "!" refers to the all of a 
   Gopher+ item's attributes. "$" refers to all the item attributes for
   all items in a Gopher directory.

3.4.7 Referring to specific Gopher+ attributes

   To refer to specific attributes, the URL's gopher+_string is
   "!attribute_name" or "$attribute_name". For example, to refer to
   the attribute containing the abstract of an item, the 
   gopher+_string would be "!+ABSTRACT". 

   To refer to several attributes, the gopher+_string consists of 
   the attribute names separated by coded spaces. For example, 
   "!+ABSTRACT%20+SMELL" refers to the +ABSTRACT and +SMELL attributes 
   of an item.

3.4.8 URL syntax for Gopher+ alternate views

   Gopher+ allows for optional alternate data representations
   (alternate views) of items. To retrieve a Gopher+ alternate view,
   a Gopher+ client sends the appropriate view and language
   identifier (found in the item's +VIEW attribute). To refer to a
   specific Gopher+ alternate view, the URL's Gopher+ string would 
   be in the form:

        +view_name%20language_name

   For example, a Gopher+ string of "+application/postscript%20Es_ES" 
   refers to the Spanish language postscript alternate view of a 
   Gopher+ item. 

3.4.9 URL syntax for Gopher+ electronic forms

   The gopher+ string for a URL that refers to an item referenced by
   a Gopher+ electronic form (an ASK block) filled out with specific 
   values is a coded version of what the client sends to the server.
   The gopher+ string is of the form:

   +%091%0D%0A+-1%0D%0Aask_item1_value%0D%0Aask_item2_value%0D%0A.%0D%0A

   To retrieve this item, the gopher client sends:

       a_gopher_selector<tab>+<tab>1<cr><lf>
       +-1<cr><lf>
       ask_item1_value<cr><lf>
       ask_item2_value<cr><lf>
       .<cr><lf>

   to the gopher server.

3.5. MAILTO

   The mailto URL scheme is used to designate the Internet mailing
   address of an individual or service. No additional information
   other than an Internet mailing address is present or implied.

   A mailto URL takes the form:

        mailto:<rfc822-addr-spec>

   where <rfc822-addr-spec> is (the encoding of an) addr-spec, as
   specified in RFC 822. Within mailto URLs, no additional characters
   are reserved within the <rfc822-addr-spec> component.

   Note that the percent sign ("%") is commonly used within RFC 822
   addresses and must be URL-encoded.

   Unlike many URLs, the mailto scheme does not represent a data
   object to be accessed directly; there is no sense in which it
   designates an object. It has a different use than the
   message/external-body type in MIME.

3.6. NEWS

   The news URL scheme is used to refer to either news groups or
   individual articles of USENET news, as specified in RFC 1036.

   A news URL takes one of two forms:

     news:<newsgroup-name>
     news:<message-id>

   A <newsgroup-name> is a period-delimited hierarchical name, such as
   "comp.infosystems.www.misc". A <message-id> corresponds to the
   Message-ID of section 2.1.5 of RFC 1036, without the enclosing "<"
   and ">"; it takes the form <unique>@<full_domain_name>.  A message
   identifier may be distinguished from a news group name by the
   presence of the commercial at "@" character. No additional
   characters are reserved within the components of a news URL.

   If <newsgroup-name> is "*" (as in <URL:news:*>), it is used to
   refer to "all available news groups".

   The news URLs are unusual in that by themselves, they do not
   contain sufficient information to locate a single resource, but,
   rather, are location-independent.

3.7. NNTP

   The nntp URL scheme is an alternative method of referencing news
   articles, useful for specifying news articles from NNTP servers
   (RFC 977). 

   A nntp URL take the form:

      nntp://<host>:<port>/<newsgroup-name>/<article-number>

   where <host> and <port> are as described in Section 3.1. If :<port>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 119.

   The <newsgroup-name> is the name of the group, while the
   <article-number> is the numeric id of the article within that
   newsgroup.

   Note that while nntp: URLs specify a unique location for the
   article resource, most NNTP servers currently on the Internet today
   are configured only to allow access from local clients, and thus
   nntp URLs do not designate globally accessible resources. Thus, the
   news: form of URL is preferred as a way of identifying news
   articles.

3.8. TELNET

   The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive services
   that may be accessed by the Telnet protocol.

   A telnet URL takes the form:

       telnet://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port> [ / ]

   as specified in Section 3.1. The port defaults to 23; the <user>
   and <password> segments are completely optional (a <password>
   requires a <user> element.)

   This URL does not designate a data object, but rather an
   interactive service. In practice, the <user> and <password>
   supplied are advisory only.

3.9.  WAIS

   The WAIS URL scheme is used to designate WAIS databases, searches,
   or individual documents available from a WAIS database. WAIS is
   described in [6]; the WAIS protocol is described in RFC 1625 [19].

   A WAIS URLs takes one the following forms:

     wais://<host>:<port>/<database>
     wais://<host>:<port>/<database>?<search>
     wais://<host>:<port>/<database>/<wtype>/<wpath>

   where <host> and <port> are as described in Section 3.1. If :<port>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 210.  The first form designates a
   WAIS database that is available for searching. The second form
   designates a particular search.  <database> is the name of the WAIS
   database being queried.

   The third form designates a particular document within a WAIS
   database to be retrieved. In this form <wtype> is the WAIS
   designation of the type of the object. Many WAIS implementations
   require that a client know the "type" of an object prior to
   retrieval, the type being returned along with the internal object
   identifier in the search response.  The <wtype> is included in the
   URL in order to allow the client interpreting the URL adequate
   information to actually retrieve the document.

   The <wpath> of a WAIS URL consists of the WAIS document-id, encoded
   as necessary using the method described in Section 2.2. The WAIS
   document-id should be treated opaquely; it may only be decomposed
   by the server that issued it.

3.10 FILES

   The file URL scheme is used to designate files accessible on
   a particular host computer. This scheme, unlike most other 
   URL schemes, does not designate a resource that is universally
   accessible over the Internet.

   A file URL takes the form:

       file://<host>/<path>

   where <host> is the fully qualified domain name of the system on
   which the <path> is accessible, and <path> is a hierarchical
   directory path of the form <directory>/<directory>/<name>.

   For example, a VMS file

     DISK$USER:[MY.NOTES]NOTE123456.TXT

   might become

     <URL:file://vms.host.edu/disk$user/my/notes/note12345.txt>

   As a special case, <host> can be the string "localhost" or the
   empty string; this is interpreted as `the machine from which the
   URL is being interpreted'.

   The file URL scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an
   Internet protocol or access method for such files; as such, its
   utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.

3.11 PROSPERO

   The Prospero URL scheme is used to designate resources that are
   accessed via the Prospero Directory Service. The Prospero protocol
   is described elsewhere [16].

   A prospero URLs takes the form:

      prospero://<host>:<port>/<hsoname>;<field>=<value>

   where <host> and <port> are as described in Section 3.1. If :<port>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 1525. No username or password is
   allowed.

   The <hsoname> is the host-specific object name in the Prospero
   protocol, suitably encoded.  This name is opaque and interpreted by
   the Prospero server.  The semicolon ";" is reserved and may not
   appear without quoting in the <hsoname>.

   Prospero URLs are interpreted by contacting a Prospero directory
   server on the specified host and port to determine appropriate
   access methods for a resource, which might themselves be
   represented as different URLs. External Prospero links are
   represented as URLs of the underlying access method and are not
   represented as Prospero URLs.

   Note that a slash "/" may appear in the <hsoname> without quoting
   and no significance may be assumed by the application.  Though
   slashes may indicate hierarchical structure on the server, such
   structure is not guaranteed. Note that many <hsoname>s begin with a
   slash, in which case the host or port will be followed by a double
   slash: the slash from the URL syntax, followed by the initial slash
   from the <hsoname>. (E.g., <URL:prospero://host.dom//pros/name>
   designates a <hsoname> of "/pros/name".)

   In addition, after the <hsoname>, optional fields and values
   associated with a Prospero link may be specified as part of the
   URL.  When present, each field/value pair is separated from each
   other and from the rest of the URL by a ";" (semicolon).  The name
   of the field and its value are separated by a "=" (equal sign). If
   present, these fields serve to identify the target of the URL.  For
   example, the OBJECT-VERSION field can be specified to identify a
   specific version of an object.

4. REGISTRATION OF NEW SCHEMES

   A new scheme may be introduced by defining a mapping onto a
   conforming URL syntax, using a new prefix. Experimental prefixes
   may be used by mutual agreement between parties. Scheme names
   starting with the characters "x-" are reserved for experimental
   purposes.

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) will maintain a
   registry of URL schemes. Any submission of a new URL scheme must
   include a definition of an algorithm for accessing of resources
   within that scheme and the syntax for representing such a scheme.

   URL schemes must have demonstrable utility and operability.  One
   way to provide such a demonstration is via a gateway which provides
   objects in the new scheme for clients using an existing protocol.
   If the new scheme does not locate resources that are data objects,
   the properties of names in the new space must be clearly defined.

   New schemes should try to follow the same syntactic conventions of
   existing schemes, where appropriate.  It is likewise recommended
   that, where a protocol allows for retrieval by URL, that the client
   software have provision for being configured to use specific
   gateway locators for indirect access through new naming schemes.

   The following scheme have been proposed at various times, but this
   document does not define their syntax or use at this time. It is
   suggested that IANA reserve their scheme names for future
   definition:

   afs	            Andrew File System global file names.
   mid              Message identifiers for electronic mail.
   cid              Content identifiers for MIME body parts.
   nfs              Network File System (NFS) file names.
   tn3270           Interactive 3270 emulation sessions.
   mailserver       Access to data available from mail servers.
   z39.50           Access to ANSI Z39.50 services.

5. BNF for specific URL schemes

   This is a BNF-like description of the Uniform Resource Locator
   syntax, using the conventions of RFC822, except that "|" is used to
   designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used around optional or
   repeated elements. Briefly, literals are quoted with "", optional
   elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements may be preceded
   with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the following
   element; n defaults to 0.

6. Security considerations

   The URL scheme does not in itself pose a security threat. Users
   should beware that there is no general guarantee that a URL which
   at one time points to a given object continues to do so, and does
   not even at some later time point to a different object due to the
   movement of objects on servers.

   A URL-related security threat is that it is sometimes possible to
   construct a URL such that an attempt to perform a harmless
   idempotent operation such as the retrieval of the object will in
   fact cause a possibly damaging remote operation to occur.  The
   unsafe URL is typically constructed by specifying a port number
   other than that reserved for the network protocol in question.  The
   client unwittingly contacts a server which is in fact running a
   different protocol.  The content of the URL contains instructions
   which when interpreted according to this other protocol cause an
   unexpected operation. An example has been the use of gopher URLs
   to cause a rude message to be sent via a SMTP server.  Caution
   should be used when using any URL which specifies a port number
   other than the default for the protocol, especially when it is a
   number within the reserved space.

   Care should be taken when URLs contain embedded encoded delimiters
   for a given protocol (for example, CR and LF characters for telnet
   protocols) that these are not unencoded before transmission.  This
   would violate the protocol but could be used to simulate an extra
   operation or parameter, again causing an unexpected and possible
   harmful remote operation to be performed.

   The use of URLs containing passwords that should be secret is
   clearly unwise.

7. Acknowledgements

   This paper builds on the basic W3 design and much discussion of
   these issues by many people on the network. The discussion was
   particularly stimulated by articles by Clifford Lynch (1991),
   Brewster Kahle (1991) and Wengyik Yeong (1991b). Contributions from
   John Curran (NEARNET), Clifford Neuman (ISI) Ed Vielmetti (MSEN)
   and later the IETF URL BOF and URI working group have been
   incorporated into this issue of this paper.

   The draft url4 (Internet Draft 00) was generated from url3
   following discussion and overall approval of the URL working group
   on 29 March 1993. The paper url3 had been generated from udi2 in
   the light of discussion at the UDI BOF meeting at the Boston IETF
   in July 1992. Draft url4 was Internet Draft 00. Draft url5
   incorporated changes suggested by Clifford Neuman, and draft url6
   (ID 01) incorporated character group changes and a few other fixes
   defined by the IETF URI WG in submitting it as a proposed standard.
   URL7 (Internet Draft 02) incorporated changes introduced at the
   Amsterdam IETF and refined in net discussion.

   The draft 03 includes changes made at Houston in Nov 93, and on the
   net before Seattle March 1994.  Draft 04 responded to various
   suggestions and remarks made since the Seattle March 1994 meeting,
   special thanks to Dan Connolly, Ned Freed, Roy Fielding, and Guido
   van Rossum for their careful readings and corrections.  Draft 05
   makes a number of minor modifications suggested at or just before
   the Toronto July 1994 IETF meeting. This draft incorporates
   numerous revisions and edits as suggested by the active members of
   the IETF URI Working Group.

APPENDIX: Recommendations for URLs in Context

   URIs, including URLs, are intended to be transmitted though
   protocols which provide a context for their interpretation.

   In some cases, it will be necessary to distinguish URLs from other
   possible data structures in a syntactic structure. In this case, is
   recommended that URLs be preceeded with a prefix consisting of the
   characters "URL:". For example, this prefix may be used to
   distinguish URLs from other kinds of URIs.

   In addition, there are many occasions when URLs are included in
   plain, non-marked-up text; examples include electronic mail, USENET
   news messages, or printed papers. In such cases, it is convenient
   to have a separate syntactic wrapper that delimits the URL and
   separates it from the rest of the text. For this purpose, is
   recommended that angle brackets ("<" and ">"), along with the
   prefix "URL:", be used to delimit the boundaries of the URL.  This
   wrapper does not form part of the URL and should not be used in
   contexts in which delimiters are already specified.

   In some cases, extra whitespace may need to be added to break long
   URLs across lines. The whitespace is ignored when extracting the
   URL. In the case where a fragment identifier is associated with a
   URL (following a "#"), the identifier would be placed within the
   brackets as well.

It would be helpful to know how this differs from RFC 1630.  Is this
summarized anywhere ?

I think this is the exact same situation with characters, words, and
SGML tags.  What does the character 'A' reference? Or the word
'bunny'? Or <H1>? How these are translated into images or interfaces
depends on your client. Some clients might read the text to you, some
will present words on a display with a serif or san-serif font. How
the client deals with a reference to 'directory icon' should depend on
some negotiation between the client, the display environment of the
client, and the organization that defines 'directory icon'.

I don't see why the browser that does a 'GET' on a URN for 'directory
icon' (however that URN is written) shouldn't in fact get the bitmap
for the directory icon. Maybe 'GET' needs more arguments, that's all.

One alternative that immediately springs to mind is that you could have HTML
as your on-line representation, with on-the-fly conversion to whatever format
you are going to use for editing. Slower editing, faster access. Seems a
sensible tradeoff to me.

BTW what are your objections to using HTML as the markup language - is it just
the ease of authoring for the non-CS types? Have you considered using one of
the What-You-See-It-Something-Like-What-You-Get HTML editors which are
springing up all over the place.

You've answered your own questions - there is no way of _forcing_ people to
add this information without some form of submissions system (short of threats
of physical violence :-)

One fairly easy method to "encourage" people to do it would be to provide
skeleton frameworks for documents with the "author", "keyword", etc fields
filled in with something suitably provocative to ensure the author filled them
out properly (Author:nobody, Keywords:nothing-of-interest... you get the
idea.)

Also, I would also have thought that in some cases you won't want the author
of the document to be able to alter certain fields (owner for example) - which
leads me to think that you are going to need some form of submission system
anyway. (or are you going to allow access to your server by everybody who is
going to author documents?)

Indexing is very doable.

If you're running a single server, then it should be fairly easy to write
something to scan for the keyword fields in your documents and produce a
suitable HTML file. If your running on multiple servers, modifying one of the
existing web-robots is probably your simplest choice (if you reject ALIWEB
that is - I still don't quite understand why it's not suitable for you).

As previously mentioned I think you are going to have to implement some form
of submissions system anyway - in which case you could tack index building
onto the end of that. Otherwise, just rebuild it once a day or something.

> Also there were very few ideas on how to track author and ownership. Does this

We have a fairly ad-hoc system here and just use the existing Unix user/group
permissions on the W3 servers file-system to track ownership and control
access (along with encouraging people to use add that <address> at the end of
the document.) [BTW Has anybody ever tried using an existing document control
system like RCS to keep track of HTML files?] This of course becomes a lot
more complex (or falls down completely) when you have more than one server, or
information being mirrored on different servers.

Oh well, back to work.

Ahhh if only we had the money. But I think you hit the nail on the head here. I 
dont envisage a situation where people will be willing to do this, so we do 
need automation. As far as I am concerned just a few small scripts may help.

But I think that its is going to be showing people that if they use the tools 
they will make their space better but if they dont that is their problem. I 
have a feeling that that is really going to have to be the bottom line. The 
problem is that I thought this from day one but its the other people in the 
development group that I have to pursuade on this, and the attitude is that 
"other people must have found a way to do this so why cant we". 

Well that just now leaves the actual method of implementation.....

Hi !!
I need your help for 2 things:

1)I'm looking for Computer Aided Learning documents on the Web.
  Any suggestions?

2)And what about the use of WWW as a tool to build interactive lessons?
  The idea I have is to build a  tutorial using WWW, but it should not
  be only a distributed hypertext, it should  also have simulations and drills.
  Any experience to share?

Thank you

We're doing this within GNN, although it's more of a 
safety mechanism (version control to go back to previous 
versions, and locking to avoid simultaneous edits) right 
now rather than being used to track ownership.  Used in
this simplistic fashion, RCS works fairly well.

We'd like to head towards some way of keeping track of 
the statuses of all the files in GNN -- which ones are 
being drafted, copyedited, linkchecked, and finally 
signed off and copied up to our public server.  I can't 
find anything within RCS that will let us do this, beyond 
some kind of primitive combination of `find' and `rlog' 
(i.e., recursively looking through the GNN development 
directories and looking for RCS status).  I've thought 
about writing some Perl scripts that maintain databases 
of filenames and statuses and other relevant information.  
The scripts could also have some logic that `knew' to 
copy a file to a public server once the status reached 
a `publish' level.

Has anyone designed or used a tool that would work in 
this capacity?

Those of you who are interested in this topic and have not already done
so may want to check out Safe-Tcl, a language designed for the precisely
analogous purpose in the email world.  

Safe-Tcl is an open language, aimed at eventual standardization, for
mail-enabled applications ("active mail" and mail-based services) which
I've been developing in conjunction with John Ousterhout, Marshall Rose,
and others.  It provides an open framework on which you can build
applications that will do essentially everything such systems as Notes
or Telescript can do, but in a heterogeneous multivendor environment. 
The system is free and unencumbered in source form -- we're looking for
people to try it, criticize it, develop applications, find holes, etc. 
Your participation is invited! 

You can ftp a document that explains the basic model, a language
specification, full source code and documentation from ftp.ics.uci.edu
in the directory mrose/safe-tcl.  

There's also a mailing list:  safe-tcl[-request]@cs.utk.edu.  Cheers.

I suppose it's time for my periodic announcement.  I'll skip the
details, but if you have the Alpha editor for the Mac, you can FTP to
cs.rice.edu:public/Alpha/Contrib/ and pick up html*.hqx (whatever is
most recent).  I must admit I like this environment a lot more than any
of the others (or I wouldn't keep improving it :-)).

Actually, I've grown much more fond of Glimpse.

http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/

It's a lot more lightweight (building the indices for our 10 meg 
collection of docs takes minutes instead of an hour with WAIS) and
is a lot less flaky.

Webbers:

I would like to suggest that we start a thread on what type of information
could be globally used or shared or at least defined for an index.

It appears there may be several efforts and approaches towards providing
indexing capabilities into the WEB. Each one has its benefits and drawbacks.

I beleive:

We should define an "objects(s)" or its contents that would allow 
inter web server information to be shared in a concise and standard format.

After we have accomplished this we can then talk about eficient (sp?:),
scalable index update and awareness protocols. 
This may be the most useful ( IMHO ) apporach to distributing index 
information to the end user or at least key border WEB servers.
This approach may allow for domains of WEB servers to exist with
internal domains sharing private data and border domains exporting
general information to the world.

Using this type of approach we would have the functionallity of DNS naming
( maybe ) and rip/BGP like information propagation (router route propagating
mechanisms ).

then again maybe not! My .98 cents worth!

Two things come to mind.  The first is IAFA/IIIR templates (see
internet-draft draft-ietf-iafa-publishing-01); they provide a
reasonable standard, concise, portable and extensible mechanism for
exporting information about objects.

The other is only a bit less obvious.  I was thinking about GLIMPSE
and how it uses two levels of indexing, the first only narrowing down
approximate location in which words are present.  Wouldn't it be great
if there were a way to do a GLIMPSE-like search, but one in which a
block corresponds not to an arbitrary portion of the information space
but a specific server to which the query can be fowarded?  And what if
you could generalize this, to work not just at two levels, but in an
arbitrary hierarchy?  An arbitrary heterarchy?

I actually spent at least an hour hashing out the details before
realizing I was reinventing whois++.

Both of the above, of course, are hardly finished being developed and
tinkered with, but closer than anything we could reinvent from scratch.

I just started to look at glimpse actually! but it seems a third higher level
would need to exist in that scheme, one that would either intelligently
pick servers to query, or make the selection based off of a selection
of "default servers".

I will look at the draft for the templates as I haven't yet :(

I didn't know if I should send this to the editor, as suggested in the
RFC, or to the list, so that other could comment on it. I decided to
do both...

On the whole, the proposed RFC seems a sound piece of work. Although
the underlying principles (usable in hard-copy, simplicity of syntax)
aren't stated explicitly, they are applied consistently and
intuitively, except for the Gopher URLs (see below).

The explanations are short, but sufficient, except that in two or
three places a sentence seems to be missing and one whole section
seems to be lost.

Ad 2) To start with that last omission: section 2 states that there will be
a section on what I assume are `partial URLs'. The section will presumably
contain the rules for abbreviating and expanding URLs in the context
of a `base URL'. However, no such section exists.

Ad 3.2.1) In the last sentence of 3.2.1, an example is given with an
empty path segment. The example seems to suggest that the non-empty
path segment (`etc') that is present as well will be ignored.

Ad 3.3) The last sentence of 3.3 mentions that HTTP URLs have a
`hierarchical structure'. It isn't explained what this entails.

Ad 3.4) The Gopher URLs are the only part of the document that seems a
little messy. The meaning of a URL seems to depend on subtle things,
such as the presence of a `7' at the start. Moreover, the semantic
differences are not reflected in the grammar in section 5. Gopher URLs
are also the only URLs where an escape (%09) functions as a
delimiter. I think that is contrary to the concept of escapes, which
is that they *remove* any special meaning.

Ad 3.8) The telnet section ends with the statement that any username
and password are `advisory only'. I can imagine what that means, but
shouldn't it be stated explicitly?

Another thing that I missed in the document is the explanation of `#'
to refer to an anchor inside a document. I think there are arguments
in favour of including the `#'. For one, most people would say that a
URL with a `#' in it is still a URL. Secondly, the same principles of
readability and printability apply to the anchor as to the rest of the
URL. Thirdly, it is very likely that the anchor will one day have to
be transferred over a network (the same happened to the hostname and
port, after the introduction of proxies.)

Currently, the `#' is only used to refer to parts of (or points in)
HTML documents, but this RFC could pave the way for a more general
application.

The best I've found so far is a combination of Adobe Photoshop and a
shareware program called epsConverter 1.0 (I just found it on America
Online so I don't have a URL to an FTP source for it yet.)

Basically epsConverter will convert any eps file (freehand, mac, pc, etc.)
to an Illustrator 3.1 file, which Photoshop can import. Then change mode to
indexed color (8-bit, system pallette) and save as a CompuServe GIF, and it
will work great with WWW/Mosaic.

Excellent! Great stuff! This is a great way to address three issues on
my list of WWW Architecture Wishlist: resource discovery, replication,
and a compound document architecture.

The list is:

	* resource discovery -- how do I find stuff? If I've got a good
	description of a given document (author, publisher, pub date, that
	sort of thing), and I have an internet
	connection, I should be able to submit a query and search the
	whole docuverse in one RPC (which will probably cascade into
	many RPC's, but as far as I'm concerned...).

	If I have only a vague description of the document I'm interested
	in, I should be able to conduct the same search, but it may take
	several RPC's, with some user interaction at each iteration.
	(e.g. What libraries are available? ... Ok, from those three,
	what databases relate to quantum physics? ...)

	* replication -- documents should be highly available; that is,
	given authorized access to sufficient connectivity, compute
	resources, and disk space, I should be _able_ (not required)
	to publish a document in such a way that there is no single
	point of failure between me, the producer, and any of my consumers.

	The USENET model addresses this feature, but due to its completely
	asynchronous operation, it lacks sufficient fault detection mechanisms.
	(e.g. I can't compute: did my message make it to foo.com?)

	Another limitation of USENET is that documents are immutable.

	* compound document architecture -- long story. But Dienst's
	support for printing pages is an application.

The items on my wishlist that dienst doesn't cover are:

	* data integrity/fault detection: If fred says "see XXX for info on
	apples," and I get XXX and it has info on oranges, I can't tell
	if there was a fault, let alone where it was. A reference/link/citation
	should be _able_ (not required) to contain integrity information
	of various levels of reliability:

		"see rfc822.txt; you'll know you've got the right XXX if
		it came from ds.internic.net any time since 1990"
			(allows replication by caching)

		"see foo.tar.Z; you'll know you've got the right foo.tar.Z if
		it has 1210921 bytes."

		"see foo.tar.Z; you'll know you've got the right XXX if
		it has a gnu cksum checksum of 1203980123"

		"see XXX; you'll know you've got the right XXX if
		it has an MD5 checksum of 2342345234lksjw34"

		"see XXX; you'll know you've got the right XXX if
		it's been RSA signed by fred@foo.com"
			(works for documents that change)


	
	* democratic publishing model -- anybody should be able to
	spontaneously create a lasting name for a document without doing
	an RPC with a naming authority. Authorized users should be
	able to create a name within a naming authority's namespace
	by doing an authenticated RPC. Document names must be associated
	with copyright owners only -- not service providers etc. (Witness
	the recent issues with 1-800 number portability between AT&T & MCI).

Goof grief!
I have a small perl program that uses GhostScript (with GIF driver) to
produve GIFs from EPS. If your GhostScript does not have a GIF driver
but can produce XPM, it uses Jef Pozkanser's PBMplus package to
produce the GIF.
All Unix, btw.

Hi,

This seems to relate to the Dienst discussion. 

We're working on a similar piece of the problem. Using LIFNs 
(Location Independent File Names (essentially, URN's that refer 
to an immutable set of octets)) we expect to be able to provide:

  support for easy replication/caching
  high scalability
  file authenticity and integrity

We (Keith Moore) gave a short presentation describing our scheme
to the URI and IIIR working groups at the last IETF meeting in
Toronto.

See attached.

Abstract

This memo describes a system for the automated replication of data files
and their descriptions to various file servers across the Internet.  The
system maintains a distributed database which contains the locations of
each file distributed by the system, and will provide a list of
locations for any file upon request.  The system provides assurances of
integrity, and authenticity, of the replicated files.  It is intended
for use with the World Wide Web, Gopher, and similar applications, to
provide higher availability, improved response, and better use of
network resources.


1. Introduction

There are a number of problems associated with the current Internet
information infrastructure, which result in poor service to its users.
These problems include:

+ lack of scability.  Many files are available at only a single file
  server.  Any popular file (e.g. Mosaic home page, weather map) will
  cause a file server to be swamped.

+ lack of fault tolerance.  If a file server is unavailable, there is no
  mechanism to find alternate servers for that file.

+ inefficient use of network resources.  The primary location of a file
  may be halfway across the globe, or on the other side of a low-
  bandwidth link.  Even when alternate locations exist, there is
  currently no mechanism to find a "nearby" location of a particular

  file.

+ no assurances of authenticity or integrity.  Files are currently
  replicated from one server to another using a variety of ad hoc
  mechanisms.  Various translations may occur during this process, and
  errors (or even deliberate modifications) may be introduced.  There is
  currently no mechanism for ensuring the integrity of replicated files,
  nor any assurance that a copy of a file which is available on a server
  has not been modified by someone other than the author.


2. Proposal

In order to address these problems, we propose the following
architecture.  It is intended to provide replication of files across
multiple servers, scalable access to the files distributed by the
system, and the assurance of integrity and (optionally) authenticity for
each file.  In addition it provides the ability to reliably cache such
files as well as the potential to take advantage of network proximity
for improved utiliziation.

Each file is given a unique name called a Location Independent File Name
(LIFN), which refers to that particular sequence of octets.  Once a LIFN
has been assigned to a file, the binding between the LIFN and that
sequence of octets may not be changed.  The space of LIFNs is sub-
divided among several "publishers" (or "naming authorities"), who are
responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of LIFNs within their portion of
LIFN-space, and also provide a LIFN-to-location mapping service for
those LIFNs.

The LIFN-to-location mapping service is provided by a network of
"location servers" collectively known as the "location database".  These
servers accept requests for locations of LIFNs, as well as updates
containing new locations or requests to delete old LIFN-to-location
mappings.  Such update requests require authentication; only those file
servers which are authorized by the publisher may store locations in the
database.

Access to files themselves is provided by more-or-less conventional file
servers, using any protocol which provides binary transparent file
access.  Such protocols would include HTTP, Gopher, FTP, and others, as
long as certain restrictions are observed.

Files are replicated among file servers using a "replication daemon".  A
copy of the replication daemon runs on each file server.  It accepts
descriptions of newly published files, and decides (based on site-
provided criteria) which files should be acquired by the file server.
It then queries the location database to find a location for each file
desired, and retrieves the file from one of the locations listed.
Finally, it updates the location database to inform it of the new
location for that file.  The replication daemon may also act as a file



Moore/Green/Wade         Expires 27 January 1995                [Page 2]

Bulk File Distribution                                      27 July 1994



reaper, deciding when to delete files, and informing the location
database when such files will no longer be available.

Associated with each file is a description.  Included in the description
is so-called "bibliographic information", such as title, author,
content-type, etc., but also an MD5 or similar fingerprint of the file.
The relevant portions of the description are cryptographically signed by
the publisher.  To perform an integrity check, a file server or user can
retrieve the description for any file (using whois++ or a similar
protocol), compute the MD5 fingerprint for that file, and compare this
with the one listed in the description.  To check authenticity, it can
also verify the credentials of the file's description.

A file is "published" in the system by creating a description to go
along with the file, signing the description with the publisher's
private key, making the file available via one or more "master" file
servers, and listing those locations in the location database.  The
description may also be sent (perhaps via ordinary email) to interested
parties.  Such parties may include slave file servers (which can use
them to decide which new files to acquire), resource discovery servers
(which can then provide search services based on the file descriptions
and/or the files themselves), and ordinary users.

The location database consists of one or more servers for each
publisher.  These are listed in either a well-known master directory, or
a reserved portion of the DNS name space, so that a client can easily
find out which server to query for a particular LIFN.  The query itself
uses a datagram-based protocol, which is designed to impose the least
possible overhead for both client and server.  Updates to the location
server use a similar protocol; however, these protocols also require
authentication to prevent unauthorized (or untrusted) servers from
listing alternate locations for a file.  Location updates are posted to
a single location server and propagated to the other peer servers via a
batch version of the update protocol (using virtual circuits rather than
datagrams).

It is not necessary to keep all location servers for a publisher in
sync.  The location query service does not guarantee that it returns all
instances of a given file.  If the list of locations provided by one
server is insufficient, the client is free to consult the other servers
in the hope of finding a better one.  Similarly, if one or more of the
locations thus provided is "stale" (that is, points to a file that no
longer exists), the client may also look for the file at its other
listed locations.  (Note that while a file server may delete a file
whose location is listed in the location database, it may not re-use a
filename for a different file or change that file in any way.).

To minimize the liklihood of stale file locations, file servers are
encouraged to inform the location database in advance of actually
deleting a file.  The response to a location query includes a "time to
live" field which is used by clients or proxy servers to maintain a



Moore/Green/Wade         Expires 27 January 1995                [Page 3]

Bulk File Distribution                                      27 July 1994



cache of LIFN-to-location mappings.  After being informed that a file is
going to disappear, the location servers will adjust the "time to live"
field in future responses to queries for that file, to reflect the time
when the file is expected to disappear.  Until that time, the "time to
live" field is the value supplied by the file server when it posted the
location.  Specifying a time to live of "N" in a location update is
tantamount to an agreement that the file server will not delete the file
without informing the location server "N" seconds in advance of doing
so.

A special file replication protocol is used between file servers.  It
provides mutual authentication to prevent spoofing, and pipelining to
transfer large numbers of files effeciently, even over high-delay links.
It may also accomodate compression on a per-file basis (for low-
bandwidth links), and checkpointing to allow for recovery when transfers
of large files are interrupted.


3. Evaluation

The system should scale in several ways.  User demand for any particular
file can be distributed over multiple file servers.  The location
database is also distributed, both because each publisher maintains its
own servers, and also because several servers can be provided for any
publisher.  In addition, the current location query protocol provides
for a cacheable "redirect" response that allows the LIFN space for a
particular publisher to be divided across several secondary servers,
without imposing any additional structure on the LIFNs themselves.
Because there is no need for synchronization, location updates can also
be distributed across several servers, and effeciently transmitted among
location server peers.  This avoids the overhead with multi-phase commit
protocols which would be needed to ensure consistency.

Integrity and authenticity are provided by the MD5 fingerprint and the
cryptographic signature in the file description.  A possible weak point
in the current system is the assumption that DNS will be used to
identify location servers for a particular publisher, since DNS is not
itself secure.  It should be pointed out that since only trusted
locations will be listed by the location service, a user may not wish to
perform integrity or authenticity checks for every file accessed.
However, the capability is there for when it is needed.

The system allows a client to consult a local cache or proxy server
before attempting to access a file which may already be available
locally.  Since the binding between a LIFN and the file is fixed, if a
client has a LIFN for a file, and the cache has a file which goes with
it, the client has a reasonable assurance that the cached copy is
correct (assuming it trusts the cache).  If the time-to-live field in a
location response is nonzero, LIFN-to-location bindings can also be
reliably cached for that amount of time.

Bulk File Distribution                                      27 July 1994



Finally, this system allows the potential that a client can select a
"nearby" location from among several locations for a file, or from among
several available location servers.  A means by which this may be
accomplished has been proposed and is under investigation.


4. Open Problems

As stated above, there is a need to provide a means by which a client
may choose from among several service locations to take advantage of
network proximity.

If existing file servers are to adopt this plan, there needs to be a
transition scheme.  As stated above, locations (i.e. file names) of
files provided by the location databases may not be reused, even for
updates to the file.  This is in contrast to the present-day use of file
locations (URLs) which are expected to be stable references to the
*current* version of a file.  If the replication daemon is to replace
the ordinary mirroring software that is presently in use, it must also
provide "stable" locations for the same files, which may be updated in
place and accessed by more traditional means.  This could be
accomplished by having each description include a "suggested-filename"
field.  The file server would concoct a local filename from this field;
any new file from the same publisher with the same suggested-filename
would replace the old copy of the file stored in that location (but not
the copy of the file stored in the location listed in the location
database).

There is a need to describe many types of relationships in the file
description.  The details of such descriptions are yet to be defined.


5. Implementation status

A prototype version of this system is being constructed by the authors.
A distributed location database and client library have been constructed
and interfaced to Mosaic; the resulting client demonstrated the ability
to (crudely) select from among multiple locations of a file, and to
recover from the failure of both file servers and location database
servers.  The replication daemon and its associated protocols are
currently under development.

Experience from the use of the prototype will be used to construct a
second version of the system, which the authors intend to make widely
available.

In print publishing, it often occurs that the publisher or
distributor does not own the copyright.  These are the parties
that need to be able to name their products, whether as agents
for copyright holders or not.  Service providers are yet
another category of business entity, though they may overlap
the categories of publisher and distributor.

Otherwise, a good wish list, Dan.

John,

In reference to your request for software to track "which ones are being
drafted, copyedited, linkchecked, and finally signed off and copied up to our public server", I was wondering if you've seen the suite of tools for the
SGI's by ClearCase, in specific one called Cleartool.  This is a versioning
system we use to accomplish similar tasks with software and documentation.

Gianfranco,

We designed a demo/tutorial using the forms feature to invoke scripts that
returned simulated or real database info, etc.  We are using HTML and Mosaic
for all our online documentation, help, tutorials, FAQs, training manuals, etc.,
on an SGI Indigo2 network.

Hope this helps.

Subject: announcing:  www-buyinfo mailing list
content-length: 2939

Announcing a new mailing list:  www-buyinfo.  Information about how
to subscribe appears at the end of this message.

Subscriptions will be accepted immediately.  Contributions to the
mailing list itself will be rejected until Tuesday, August 16, 1994,
to make sure (slightly) belated subscribers don't miss the early
discussions.  Those who subscribe by August 16 will be notified
when the mailing list "opens" for discussion.

The purpose of the mailing list is to discuss topics related to this
vision:

Potential information providers would willingly make a vast array of
information available on the World-Wide Web (WWW) if they knew they
could get paid for it.  The system should work like this:  using your
favorite WWW client program, when you select a hypertext link ("buyinfo
link") that reaches a server that charges money for the information,
the server informs the client program (via HTTP) that there is an
associated charge and lists the available payment options.  The client
can give up, either because it has no payment capability or because the
user chooses not to buy the information.  Otherwise the client passes
the server some information (via HTTP) that will enable the server to
be reimbursed for the information.  The server then returns that
purchased information.  If the client is designed in a way that the
user can make money available beforehand (and with a suitable
user-protection interface), a user could traverse buyinfo links
effortlessly, and the financial details would occur invisibly.

These components are required to implement the vision:
	- http:  to allow the exchange of cost and payment information
	- client/server application programmer interfaces (APIs) that make
	  it easy to add different kinds of payment schemes
	- clients that provide an attractive, convenient, safe interface
	  to support payment
	- ways to support transactions in multiple currencies

Some possible payment schemes are:  anonymous credit cards, DigiCash,
electronic checks, conventional credit cards.

Other relevant topics for this mailing list:
	- the privacy of financial transactions
	- authentication of payers
	- the efficiency of payment schemes
(Note:  I expect that many of the authentication issues will be solved
in a more general context by people working on secure HTTP and will be
discussed on the www-security mailing list.)

This mailing list is NOT for discussion about:
	- whether charging for information is a good idea
	- how to exchange orders electronically

Subject: Re: ftp interface with www
content-length: 1004


Ravi,

   I created a link between the sheets. i.e.

   ln -f /users/mannh/html/SMUG /usr/spool/ftp/SMUG
   ln -f /usr/spool/ftp/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/home/archives

Then, you reference the directory or file by 
ftp://www.server.com/archives/file.name.hqx

Works great for me.

     Hello,
     
     I am trying to get ftp interface work with Mosaic and need some help.  
     Do I have to set up anonymous ftp account on my server first before I 
     actually use "ftp://ipaddress/directory" in my html document?  I tried 
     looking at other servers' html and seems like all you need is just ftp 
     address?  I get the generic the server is refusing to give access or 
     down message while I try to access the ftp command.  Is there a help 
     file on any server which could give me some help?
     
     Thank you so much.
     
     ravi

I'm interested in Oracle-WWW gateways - current approaches, prototypes, 
future thoughts, anything!  And would very much like to correspond with 
anyone working on such.

I am involved in a project that is considering the Web as a means to make 
a variety of information available - including Oracle data, internally to a 
very broad user base.  I'm particularly interesting in gateways that 
provide "browsing" capabilities - providing access to Oracle data using the 
same metaphor as all other Web-accessible data.

An example is Stan Letovsky's work at Yale, but I want to make sure we 
don't overlook any additional work being done elsewhere.  Particularly work 
done to insulate the gateway itself from the backend database (e.g. RDA, 
etc.)

If you can point me towards any good resources I'd greatly appreciate your 
time.  Please contact me via any of:

In my earlier posting I should have pointed folks at Dr. Letovsky's work at 
Yale.  The URL is

    http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/genera.html

It's a very interesting example of hiding the SQL nature of the underlying 
database - but depends on Sybase's stored procedure features to make it 
work.  Oracle lacks the ability to return result sets from their stored 
procedures.  Dr. Letovsky is moving to Johns Hopkins, and so I'm not sure 
of the status for future enhancements, but is very friendly and willing to 
discuss his work.

Hope that helps!  I found this, and other examples, at

    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/RDBGate/Overview.html

which notes the www-rdb mailing list at cern.

Also, rather than flood both lists, I'll post the results back to www-
rdb@info.cern.ch - they're already pouring in!

Thanks!

Subject: Progress reporting in future HTTP
content-length: 2084

How about adding progress report feedback as an option to the future HTTP spec?
Some browsers already do some progress reporting (X Mosaic's "read 123456 of
98765 bytes") when they know how far they have to go, but suppose the server
is running a script that takes some amount of time that the client has no
 way of knowing.  The server may know that it has done 500 out of 5000 items,
and it would be nice to provide the information to the client.

The HTML could look like this, for example.
As soon as the computation starts, either an HTTP header like
        NOTING-PROGRESS: Searching database
or maybe an HTML tag would be better, like
        <NOTING-PROGRESS DESCRIPTION="Searching database" NOUN="record" VERB="fetching">
Later, the server would send, intermingled with the real text (but not inside a tag)
        <NOTE-PROGRESS 100/5000>
and later
        <NOTE-PROGRESS 500/5000>
and still later
        <NOTE-PROGRESS 900/5000>
and finally
        </NOTING-PROGRESS>
and it would ensure that output packets are sent every few seconds
even if they're not full (that is, fflush(stream) in C, (force-output stream)
in Lisp, and so on).

The tags would not be rendered, of course.  The client could ignore the
information or present it to the user in any of a number of ways:

1.  A progress bar, like the Macintosh Finder or the Symbolics Lisp Machine.

2.  An animation of an hourglass sifting sand, or a drinking glass filling up,
    or a watch hand turning 360 degrees, or a day/night terminator moving on
    Mosaic's rotating globe, etc.

3.  A printed estimate of time remaining, like many applications
    including Mac ZTerm's zmodem display
        Time elapsed / remaining:  1:23 / 4:56
    where the first number counts up at a constant rate and the
    second counts down at a non-constant rate as the estimage changes.

The verb and noun could optionally be displayed by the client, as in
"Now fetching Record 500 of 5000 records".

I used these patches for a while - but until it gets added to the

the use of "Status:" was conflicting and "Progress:" should be used
instead.

I second this motion.
It would be extremely useful in the situation when a request (potentially one
part of a compound set of requests or actions ) was farmed out to multiple
servers. the status or results may have time limits or data size limits
before the rest of the request(S) proceed.

Well I guess the subject says it all.

I have a daemon working fine appart from the fact that it occasionally
receives some HTTP 0.9 requests.

	E.G.	GET /?examples^M\n

Now since the daemon relies on HTTP/1.0 status codes (I assume... did
0.9 support 302 for example), should I:

a) try and provide basic support for HTTP 0.9 or
b) have the daemon send an error message to the effect that the client
   is using an old version of HTTP which isnt supported.

Luckily either way wont take too long (since the URL parsing is done
using yacc - dont ask, I was told to do it that way), but Im wondering
which is the more correct response according to this group.

Cheers,

Paul

I'm looking for a UNIX (or VMS) tool to convert .PIF-pictures to .GIF (or .eps) 
A Unix tool is prefered. 
Who can give me a tip on a good converting program?

We need to add some graphs to our hypertext, those graphs already exist in PIF.

Hi folks.


I built yet anthor proxy server which named 'Wcol'.

This proxy server prefetch and cache WWW data.
If you access WWW via wcol, you can get data quickly.


Major features:

    - Prefetching
	Analyze anchor and in-line image in HTML, and access automatic.
    - Caching
	Store WWW data, and send as server.
    - Convertion
	Analyze Content-type in HTTP/1.0, and execute programs to
	convert you want format.
	(User definable convertion table)


If you want more information of wcol, please access to...
  http://shika.aist-nara.ac.jp/shika/naist/yamamoto_lab/k-chinen/wcol/wcol.html

I really like this.   The only problem with it is that

	Status: 101 10 10% complete

Where "101" is an informational message (some percentage complete) 
which has a single two-digit numeric parameter,  and "102" is an 
informational message (finis) which has no parameters.   The text 
following any parameters may be displayed by the client in absence 
of a  message code -to- local language  mapping function. 
 
The numbers 101 and 102 are somewhat arbitrary.   I allowed that 
someone may have used 100,  though I've never seen it from a server 
or in the spec.   They could perhaps be merged where "101 100" 
means  "finished"  (100%).   (tho we're not in immediate danger 
of running out of message code space)

Fine.   Then c/Status:/Progress:/ in the snippet above.

Does it prefetch all the time, or do requests from line mode browsers or GUI 
browsers with delayed image loading get detected? For example, a browser could 
twiddle its accept headers to indicate that it was not (currently) looking for 
images. I was not able to determine this from the online documentation

PS Could you post a quick description of the differences betwwen HTML and 
SJIS-HTML which is mentioned in the online docs?

	Occasionally?   I'm a little surprised that you don't 
get them more frequently.   I responded to a note a couple of days ago 
about two clients  (one of which I wrote)  that had trouble with some 
NT based server that rejected  "simple GET"  requests.   I was really 
quite surprised.   Paul,  yours isn't the same NT server,  is it?

	All you really need to do is look for the  "HTTP/1.0" 
and set a flag.   If that flag remains unset,  then respond 
without headers;  if it's set,  then respond with headers. 
 
	You should always generate some  "this document has moved" 
or  "this document is actually here"  HTML.   Send that,  and the 
0.9 clients will be at least usable with your server.   Such HTML 
may be discarded by a 1.0 client.   Otherwise ... 
 
> b) have the daemon send an error message to the effect that the client
>    is using an old version of HTTP which isnt supported.
 
	No way.   0.9 may be  "old HTTP",  but the  "simple GET" 
is still in the protocol  (or I read the wrong 1.0 spec somewhere 
AND that author is asking for trouble, headaches, and flames). 
One of the two clients I mentioned above is my own,  which intentionally 
does a  "simple GET"  for reasons other than just my own laziness.

	I honestly feel better about this somewhat demanding 
recommendation since you say it won't take long to implement. 
(programmer time is the most expensive part) 
 
	I'm finding other suggestions for  well behaved  servers in 
 
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html
 
	Tim signed it,  but didn't date it.   How old is this 0.9 doc? 
It's got a lot of  still relevant  stuff in it.

I _really_, _really_ like the idea of message codes; maybe I want
a gas guage type progress indicator instead of a natural language 
message.

It'd also be nice to have some mechanism for getting arbitrary
messages to the user. A priority code would be useful as well.

examples-

User-Message: 0 This server will be getting a new paint job soon.

User-Message: 9 Look out! Someone's trying to kill you!


It might make sense to combine both sorts of informational
messages (progress, arbitrary info, and others) in one 
"Info:" header type.

  - Wcol prefetch all the time.
  - Wcol dont' detect to client is what.

Ok. SJIS is japanese processing jargon. There are many japanese encording
method.  SJIS is one of these. 
It is one of example to wcol conversion feature. Wcol can convert any
japanese encording HTML to SJIS encording HTML by executing conversion
program.
# I think to it is maybe bad example...

The difference is that I can't obtain any information from CompuServe
unless I subscribe in advance.  I don't have to subscribe in advance to
get information from WWW servers.  If there were an infrastructure to
support payment electronically, CompuServe could make its information
available to everyone via WWW and still get paid for it.

If building that infrastructure appeals to you, by all means subscribe
to the www-buyinfo mailing list:
    Send mail to www-buyinfo-request@allegra.att.com

In theory, you don't need message codes to handle languages.  The
browsers should be sending an "Accept-Language:" header and your
server should be using that to determine what to write in the
"Progress:" headers.  And you don't need them in practice because
you either ignore the issue (98% of the cases) or your server has
already decided that the retrieval in question is part of the
English, French, German or whatever part of the document space.

I got bogged down with other things and never did come up with
patches to handle "Progress:" instead of "Status:" headers.
I contemplated having both a human-readable string form of the
header and a numeric "k of n" form.  Certainly the readable
string form is more flexible so I recommend we just consider
that for now.  "Progress:" is certainly useful when you need
it, but it's not so commonly necessary that it needs to be fancy.
Ideally it should never be necessary.  The documents should come
back too fast.

Sure, it's a hack, but it's the simplest way to do it, is extremely
useful when you need it and beats the hell out of wondering if
the archie gateway is still processing your query or has, in fact,
been nuked from orbit.  What needs to be done to get it in the spec?

Not all servers can or should have to handle every potential
language. This is the client's job.

The other situation that needs handling is the case
where a human user isn't sitting at the other end but a program
that might want to make use of this information. Imagine trying
to write an automatic ftp script without the message codes that
ftp gives you.

Speaking of VMS... is there either client or server WWW software for VAX
machines running VMS?  how about Ultrix?  We just got a VAX Station 3000
and an older (Non-Alpha) Vax Station 5000 for free and are trying to
figure out what to do with them :-).

Subject: Bug or Security Feature in Server reply?
content-length: 1327

Hi,

I don't know if this is the right place....

I have written a CGI-script (at server-side, of course) which will answer 
*WHERE* the client can find some files at its *LOCAL* side 
(YES, this seems to be undelightful: WHY does a client has to ask the 
server (which is not a "file"-server ;-)) where to find a file at local
side? 
Well, because *REGARDING* to FORMS we don't have possibilities to
exec local script (shipped with the right parameter) at clientside...)
:-((

The CGI-script return an on_the_fly HTML with something like this:

 <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT"the_local_GIF" SRC="file://localhost/../All_Pics/12.gif">

which should mean something like: go up one level of your current directory and
down to 'All_Pics' at your side (CD) 

Passing this kind of HTML-code causes two tested clients (XMosaic 2.4 & MacWeb)
to look at server's URL (ie. its CGI-BIN-dir) for the file(s)!

You might say: "That's to be excepted, because the action-URL in the FORM becomes
the actual matching MAIN-URL!" but in my opinion this is a failure because *after*
starting the form you are not at server side any more but at client side (the 
transmission has successfully ended), aren't you?

BTW: Saving the requested document and reloading local will work as supposed...


Any comments?

Why not use a <BASE> tag in the <HEAD> of the returned HTML?  Then your
relative URL would become relative to the HREF attribute of the BASE
element and not the HREF of the CGI script.  You'd want a line in the
headers some thing like:

<BASE HREF="file://localhost/.">

Or am I missing something here?

Sorry if this the wrong place to ask such a question but
can anyone tell me if there is a mail list devoted to simply

A bigger difference: providing information to Compuserver.  Or how about 
connecting your entire LAN to Compuserve?  Or how about integrating your 
current IS w/ Compuserve, and not introducing a new interface?

What would have happened if everyone went to Compuserve for the images on 
the Jupiter hit?

I guess the point that is pertinent is, don't think only about 
information consumers.  Remember the democracy of the net allows anyone 
to be an information provider.  That, I believe, is the difference, not 
technical architecture.

I have access to our Corporate paid Compuserve account, and you know what?  
We've had it for over 6 months and I haven't yet come up with a reason that I 
should use it.  I have NEVER used it.  Everything I'm interested in, I can find 
on the Internet for free and faster.  Once you know your way around, it 
dominates.  I can find anything that I need-- Fast!  And there is a lot more 
information globally, than any one company can contain electronically.

I used to be a member of America Online, which I used quite often.  It is very 
straight-forward and leads you exactly where you want to go.  The internet 
however, can be a maze and time consuming for new users.  I guess a lot of 
users feel that it is easier and more cost effective to be handed their host 
via a silver platter, than to be forced into a jungle and expected to catch 
their own food.

Of course.  Credit card numbers are only the tip of the iceberg.
You're assuming credit cards are the only way I had in mind to pay for
information.  In fact, it's one of about a half-dozen different
possible payment schemes.  All would require an element of encryption.
For example, in a billing-style server, the server ought to authenticate
you before it hands out information, so it can be sure it's really you
who asked for the information (and will get charged).

Encryption may play two other roles:
	- prevent an eavesdropper from getting for free the information
	  you paid for
	- enhance privacy (see http://www.research.att.com/#acc)

I think people have misunderstood my reply to the original message where 
I suggested that the proposed service is like CompuServe.

My point was that the Internet is not CompuServe, i.e., not a for-profit 
service. In fact, it's not a servie at all, in the sense of having 
consumerism as its main focus.

I agree that my response was a tad irresponsible, however, it was 
prompted by sadness in seeing that this is the type of thing that is 
going to be happening on the Internet.

I too had a CompuServe account for a few months and never used it. Why? 
Especially since all fees would be going into the Block brothers' pockets 
(Henry and Robert, I think).

EDI Working Group Meeting
Toronto, Ontario, CA

Chair, D. Crocker.

Minutes:  Wednesday (Cindi Mills); Thursday (Walt Houser) --
with distortions and misrepresentations added by the chair.
Blame him, not them.

Note:  These notes are rather longer than usual IETF meeting
minutes, since they are intended as input to the working
group's new effort at a "usage" document.  They also
(accurately) reflect the somewhat free-ranging (or even
rambling and redundant) nature of the discussion, at times.

Agenda

Wednesday, 13:30 - 15:30
13:30 - 14:00       Greetings, intros, summary of tech spec,
                    current goal, etc.
14:00 - 15:00       General discussion of issues surrounding
                    "Use of EDI over the Internet"
15:00 - 15:30       Walt Houser, U.S. Federal ECAT

Thursday, 13:30-15:30
13:30 - 14:00       Sample table of contents for usage
                    document
14:00 - 15:00       Detailed discussion of expected/intended
                    contents
15:00 - 15:30       Assignments & schedule


WEDNESDAY

Intro

This was the second meeting of the working group.  The WG is
focussing on the carriage of EDI objects through simple
encapsulation of EDI objects in MIME. EDI over X.400/X.435
already exists.

Three MIME objects, or content-type types have been defined:
        EDI-X12
        EDIFACT
        EDI-Consent

There is a lot of structure that goes along with the
unstructured EDI documents, therefore some "unstructured" or
non-EDI objects may need to be encapsulated into other EDI
objects to retain context. Other EDI (and associated non-
EDI) objects may be carried as separate MIME objects. For
EDI-specific semantic or syntactic work, need to coordinate
with the EDI community on what objects will be standardized
within EDI, e.g., EDI internal citation of MIME objects.


General Discussion

The Usage document is intended to assist the EDI and
Internet communities in understanding the operational
requirements for doing EDI over the Internet and to indicate
current solutions.  Since this is a broad-ranging topic, the
rest of the discussion time of the meeting was devoted to
free-flowing exposition and discussion, saving the
structured work for the next day.  Several mini-
presentations were made by participants, along with the
usual group discussion; none of the rest of this section is
particiularly coherent, from one paragraph to the next...

Robert Moscowitz, Chrysler:  Automobile Assocation will be
requiring all OEM supplier information to be IP-based.  CAD
group doesn't want to include CAD data INSIDE EDI, prefers
to transport CAD data as separate data.  Their FastBatch
process requires a 2-minute turnaround of EDI data, so mail
approach does not have adequate response guarantee.
(response time and latency)  Also the range of transport
choice is important.

The WG Chair observed that there is a need to distinguish
between high-level user requirements (core requirements) and
engineering requirements (technical consequences of taking a
particular implementation approach).  Security implications
- using the Internet-at-large or Virtual Private Network
(private internet with direct private line between two known
parties).  Establish a core set of urgent capabilities with
known limitations that can be implemented today and an
extended set of action items that can be implemented later.

Eric Fleischman, Boeing:  has used EDI for many years.
Standardized on X.12 and UN EDIFACT.  Try to carry this over
X.400 and X.435.  Currently using X.25 public networks and
many private links, some proprietary. Common transport
inside Boeing is TCP/IP.  Would like to do EDI between
Boeing divisions VANs perform logging.  Internet is a best-
effort type of thing.  Need acountability.


Discussion:

Accountability:  Need accountability - want a guaranteed
receipt of delivery and an audit trail to show what happened
and exact recipient time.  (Is a third party necessary to
keep impartial logs?  Private lines don't have a third
party, how is accountability handled for private lines.)
Restricted list of trading partners.  Virtual private line
can be provided by an encrypted tunnel between trading
partners who have firewalls on the network.  Need Integrity:
checksum, signed end to end, digitally signed receipt.

Concern for spoofing, s/w mailer bugs:  These mailer bugs
are common to many mailers, but managers only hear about
SMTP bugs.  Should write some explanatory text to cover
security issues and set the record straight.

X12.58 provides internal security for a single EDI field.
Graularity of security, object vs. field.

Government requires timestamps for open bidding, etc.

Must track and trace documents through entire system -- from
start to finish.  997 functional acknowledgement.  This is
more than a receipt -- it is a complete trail documenting a
transaction or string of transactions.  Wanted by laywers,
accountants, auditors.  Must be able to PROVE time and place
of contract formation.

Time-delayed delivery, X.400 has certain desirable store and
forward facilities?

Jim Amster, AT&T: Cochair of Communications Task Group at
EDI? Liaison from X12C. Tracking ... time of delivery AND
time of receipt/reading/acceptance.  Want to debug and find
lost documents.

Performance of the Internet is perceived as inadequate, by
some.  Need guidelines on how to achieve reasonable
performance over the internet.  Perception generated by low-
value-added services, rather than the underlying net.  Many
suppliers are coming in at 2400 baud with bisync, so
Internet will be perceived as faster.  (Note, less
predictable in response time.)

Certification of EDI format.

Specify what's necessary for interoperability between MIME
and X.400/X.435.  Separate and parallel, or gateway for
translating between them?

X.435 includes security features, notifications.  This
general capability (object and field level security?) PEDI
message replaces X.400 P2 header with the X.435 PEDI --
separate, not necessarily isomorphic control mechanisms.
This group should specify common base of functions as a
separate effort?

Interactive EDI: latency, response time.  Health care
industry wants access to patient benefits, records via EDI.
Auto industry has "critical shortages" currently taken care
of by interactive 3270 sessions which should be interactive
EDI, e.g. truck leaving dock with following load, arrives
your door in less than 15 minutes.

THURSDAY

Rubber meets the road.  Must produce Usage document table of
contents and some writing assignments.

The purpose of the usage document are the following:

o  Review operational requirements of different kinds of
  EDI, based on exisitng practise.
o  Review of operational realities and choices for the
  current Internet.
o  Suggest feasible, current styles of EDI use.
o  Specify enhancement to Internet services support of
  additional EDI use.
o  Creating a practice for refereince within EDI X12 to a
  MIME body part.

Security of the Internet.  Many press reports cite instances
of security problems of the Internet.  But sensitive data
can be sent using the Internet, even in clear-text, if the
connection is controlled.

Usage document

you...

(It was observed that another, more focused 'usage' document
is going to be needed, to help EDI folks understand the

The meeting adjourned with something of a wimper, probably
due to the ambitiousness of the schedule and the
dauntingness of the writing tasks...

Subject: Minimal Authorization
X-Mailer: <Windows Eudora Version 2.0.2>
content-length: 1122

Has there been any recent discussion in regard to a minimal authorization
for HTTP ?

SHEN and the other proposals that have come up recently are fine
and serve a good purpose.  However, I think there is a need for some
minimal authorization, low-security mechanism for some applications.

While I'm sure the security purists will object to passwords and HTTP
objects sent in the clear, I think there are, in the near term, many
applications that require security only "as good as what they're using now"
(ie passwords and text sent in the clear).   A good application of this
was demonstrated by Mr. Freeman-Benson's paper in Geneva.

Anyone here wish to comment on the appropriateness of such an implementation ?
I am thinking of simply implementing the "Authorization" field "user" scheme
as it is loosely proposed in the 11/93 HTTP spec and "implemented by AL Sep
1993".

Ari - if you're listening - any comments or words of wisdom on your
ACCESS_AUTH code ?

What I would look for in a programming language for remote 'agents' to
be sent in mail, executed locally, etc.

What I'm looking for is a language that includes, in the language, a
security model, with a full notion of an `agent' that operates on the
behalf of a `user', `group', or `service', where procedures are
exported, can examine the identity of the user on whose behalf they
were called, can dynamically or statically declare which operations
are available to which classes of users, or operate conditionally
depending on whose behalf they were called, and where there is no way
to cheat, since the agent is signed by the user securely. I don't see
this in Safe-TCL. The language doesn't have any simple way to
determine whose authority a procedure executes with. Maybe Safe-TCL is
a useful platform on top of which one could build this kind of
security model, but it isn't there, and it isn't obvious that Safe-TCL
actually provides 'an open framework on which you can build' such
applications.

Cool idea... here are some relevant technologies:

>From "Obliq Quick Start"
http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/Obliq/Obliq.html

----
Obliq is a lexically-scoped untyped interpreted language that supports
distributed object-oriented computation.

An Obliq computation may involve multiple threads of control within an
address space, multiple address spaces on a machine, heterogeneous
machines over a local network, and multiple networks over the
Internet.

Obliq objects have state and are local to a site. Obliq computations
can roam over the network, while maintaining network connections.
----

In oblique, all filesystem operations take a filesystem object
as a parameter. There are read-only filesystem objects, and read-write
objects.

A computation on host A might have a local variable fs that is a filesystem
object on host A. The computation could migrate to host B, but

	f = open(fs, "/etc/passwd")

still accesses A's filesystem. In order to get access to a filesystem
on host B, the computation might do something like (syntax is python,
but you get the idea):

	def challenge(num):
		return RSAdecrypt(num, my_secret_key)

	fsB = B.askForFS(my_identity, challenge)
	f = open(fsB, "/some/file")

i.e. the client identifies itself, and asks for a filesystem object.
The askForFS methon on B calls the challenge callback with a random
number, encrypted with my_identity's public key. The agent knows
my_secret_key, and is able to meet the challenge. Hence the agent
is authenticated. (Note that the challenge() computation can take
place on host A, so the secret key never goes over the wire).
If the authenticated principal is authorized, B will return it's
filesystem object, hence making it available in the agent computation's
lexical scope.

Alternatively, you could use safe-tcl, and have the client RSA sign
the tcl-code. All requests from a run of that tcl code would then
be authenticated as the signing client principal.

You might look at the Scheme Underground and scheme48 projects too:

	http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/su/su.html

There are some interesting papers on the subject too:

<dt>Cliff Neuman
<dd> <a href="ftp://prospero.isi.edu/pub/aac/pbaa.ps.Z">Proxy Based Authorization and Accounting for Distributed Systems</a>

AT&T has an additional portion of Mime which provides a 'safe' programming 
language. Nathaniel Borenstein would be the contact, I suppose.

TCL has a 'safe' version as well.

'safe' in the sense that a program cannot do stupid things like 

	'cd /;rm -rf *'

I expect this is the sort of thing "DeclareHarmless" is supposed to be 
for. Declare harmless a procedure which checks the signature, and if it's 
valid, declare a bunch more stuff as harmless.  - Darren

Review and Publication Process

   
   
    The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international
   consortium in the future, but the need for this document is immediate.
   SGML Open and the Internet Engineering Task Force have offered to host
   this review.
   
   For details on the status of HTML as an SGML Open technical report,
   contact Yuri Rubinsky, <yuri@sq.com>.
   
   There will be a BOF at the July IETF meeting to discuss the formation
   of an HTML WG in the IETF. (See HTML BOF is Tuesday from TimBL)
   
   The document will be publicly available throughout the review process.

    Trouble Downloading This Stuff?
    
   
   
   To download the postscript and/or tar file with Mosaic:
    1. Choose "Load To Local Disk" from the Options Menu
    2. Select the desired anchor
    3. Mosaic transfers the bits, prompts for a filename
    4. Enter a filename to save the data
    5. Don't forget to turn of "Load To Local Disk"
       
   
   
   If you still can't get it to work, or if you don't have HTTP access to
   www.hal.com, check the www-html archive, as several volunteers from
   that list provide email and ftp access to this spec.
   
Background and Related Materials

   
   
    The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in
   July of 1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in the
   usage of HTML, and certain new features have emerged. Widespread
   commercial support for HTML is on the horizion, and while there is a
   relatively stable set of features in current practice, there is no
   document that specifies them.
   
   These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability among
   developing HTML implementations, and to investigate interactions with
   implementations that support more or fewer features than the current
   practice.

It's possible that the DNS info for the host hasn't made it
to your local network. I suppose a number of things could
cause this.

Anyway, there is such a host. I verified the link just before I send
that mail out, and here I verify the DNS info:

Well, let me try to explain the reasoning behind this claim, which I
realize is a very strong claim that might appear overblown. 

The goal of Safe-Tcl is to provide a language for mail-enabled
applications (including but not restricted to the kinds of agents you
describe), in a way that is fully compatible with the OPEN standards of
today's Internet email.  In some places, these standards are quite clear
and well-understood -- SMTP, 822, MIME, etc.  In other places, however,
things are still evolving.  One of the most unclear areas is email
authentication.  Between PEM and PGP there is a fair amount of murky
ground, as I'm sure you will readily admit. 

Now, clearly an authentication infrastructure is very important to
mail-enabled applications; no one would debate that.  The question is
whether such an authentication infrastructure should be a part of the
language model, as in Telescript, or whether it should be orthogonal
thereto.  Safe-Tcl comes down squarely on the "orthogonal" side.  Our
position is that there should be an authentication standard for Internet
mail, and it should be used by Safe-Tcl or any other mail-enabling
language. 

However, the problem is that we're trying to build a language (Safe-Tcl)
in ADVANCE of the standardization of the authentication infrastructure. 
(The only alternatives are to either wait for the authentication wars to
end, or to have the enabled mail system NOT be orthogonal to the general
authentication infrastructure.)  So how do we do it?  Conceptually, very
simply.  We say that the information about authentication is provided
out-of-band to Safe-Tcl, by whatever mechanism (also outside of the
specification) invoked Safe-Tcl in the first place.  Inside Safe-Tcl,
this information is made available with the SafeTcl_Services variable in
the *trusted* interpreter, where it is not modifiable by untrusted code.
 

Thus, for example, if you want to experiment with authenticated enabled
mail, using (for example) PGP with Safe-Tcl, you would configure your
MIME viewer in such a way that after PGP-decrypting a MIME entity of
type application/Safe-tcl (or a multipart message containing such an
entity), you would make the authentication information available to the
Safe-Tcl interpreter. 

This is all completely doable today, using the public interpreter
(swish) and pgp.  Your pgp-decryption process just needs to feed the
authentication information to swish, which can be made to stick the pgp
signature information in the SafeTcl_Services variable using the
-initeval mechanism on the command line.  Then, your personal or site
extensions, which execute in the trusted interpreter, can take
differential action based on this authentication information.  

No kidding, this all works today, with today's version of the Safe-Tcl
interpreter.   -- Nathaniel

Subject: E-Mail form binary
content-length: 475

I've seen dozens of e-mail forms implemented across the Web, though on
attempt to actually write one myself, I failed miserably.  I've tried using
Tom Boutell's email.c and util.c to create a viable binary, but have had
ZERO luck.

Does anyone have an e-mail app that works easily with a basic subject,
name, text filed form?  In particular, does anyone have a *fat binary* for
a Sun Sparcstation running Solaris 4.0.1?

Any help would be mucho appreciated.

Best,

Here's one I wrote; it uses the libCGI library, available in
ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/wsk/sunos/libcgi

Kevin Hughes made an enhanced version of this, in the hypermail
distribution (also on our ftp server).

At the risk of sounding too much like an alarmist and a security
zealot, passwords in the clear are no longer an acceptable risk.  At
the very least, a challenge-response system is necessary.

One useful scheme is S/Key: it's free, easily avaiable and fits into
the existing paradigms.

Much stronger schemes are also available, e.g. Kerberos, public key
systems, etc.  However, you're asking for a lightweight security
scheme, and that's not unreasonable, but passwords in the clear are
simply not adequate for any purpose whatsoever unless the path between
the user and server is confidential.  In the Internet, this is no
longer the case and will not be for the forseeable future.

This point has been identified as a critical issue in the security of
the Internet and highlighted in a recent Internet Architecture Board
workshop.

I fully expected this response and appreciate your input.  "In the clear"
is somewhat vague, though.  For example, what if they were simply Base64
(or uuencode, or rot13, or...) encoded ?  Then they're not in the clear,
but the "encryption" is keyless and therefore somewhat trivial.

These are overkill for many applications, hence my request.  I'm looking
more for the "window latch protection" - it won't keep a determined
burgler out of your house, but it will keep the honest person honest.

>This point has been identified as a critical issue in the security of

I appreciate your input and will hopefully not perpetuate passwords in the
clear (such as TELNET, FTP, etc).  How does IETF propose to enhance these
existing protocols ?  Surely they won't jump from "clear" to DES and
digital signatures ?  Perhaps there is some common ground here ?

No, these types of transformations provide no protection.  The current
state of hacker technology includes widespread use of sniffers.
Passwords appearing in transit are now regularly recorded and
exploited.  Extraction of these passwords from the stream of other
material requires enough sophistication to find the right fields,
determine if the packet contains the password, extract it if it
exists, and forward, perhaps via a circuitous and/or encrypted path,
back to the bad guy.  Given this level of sophistication on the part
of the hacker, the longest part of adding uudecode or rot13 to the
sequence is the time it would take him to sneer.

For protection like S/Key, protocols do not have to changed.  Only the
end server end of a connection need be changed.  The server simply has
to present the challenge, which it can usually do as part of the
prompt to the user.  Instead of sending the same password each time a
connection is established, the password changes each time.

Future protocols will evolve to provide smoother support for this
level of authentication, but the capability exists now.

But given that a small percentage of Internet users are at this level of 
sophistication, I think that there are still applications for which 
minimal authorization is totally fine.  These are applications in which 
no real assets are protected, where the passwords are used more for 
identification than for true authentication.  Where the payoff for 
cracking isn't all that great.  

An example of this is posting an article to USENET.  It is certainly
possible to forge posts, yet this doesn't hinder its effectiveness all
that much.  It takes about 10 minutes to teach someone how to forge a 
post; 1 minute if they have practice forging email.  People who are 
concerned with making sure their identities can't be forged give their
posts digital signatures, of course.

Now, if Microsoft were to come out with "Forging for Windows" or
"MacForge", then I'd be more concerned about this.  I don't think I'm
coming out on a limb when I say sniffing won't be something that'll ever
be trivially easy. 

But I should also qualify this with the comment that most password 
applications today should have stronger encryption.

 >>the very least, a challenge-response system is necessary.

I too appreciate the fact that Steve is listening in.

What triggered this message is the question:

	Do we have any security requirements that require extremely
	long lived keys?

What I'm thinking is whether we need authenticators or signatures or
whatever that last for ten, twenty, fifty... years

I'm concerned about the needs of archivists, research folk, lawyers,
etc.  who will sometime in the distant future need to dig through all
this stuff that is going to be published.

Are these real risks or am I being a raving alarmist?

Brian, et al.,

The essence of your argument is that nothing serious will happen if
the password is stolen.  If so, then it's basically unimportant to
have a password in the first place; just use names without any
protection at all.

Once you go to the trouble of having state information specific to the
user maintained on the server, i.e. a secret shared between the user
and the server, you've already decided there's something worth
protecting.  In that case, protecitng the password in transit seems
obligatory.

You're arguing otherwise.  I don't know of applications where it makes
sense to have passwords but doesn't matter if the passwords are
disclosed to unauthorized people as they're sent over the network.  I
suppose there might be such applications, but I don't know of any.

The issue isn't whether the ordinary *user* is competent to mount a
sniffing attack; the question is what the ordinary *hacker* will do.

Karl,

I hadn't seen the reference to long lived keys before.  That changes
things considerably.  In addition to strong authentication mechanisms,
there has to be quite a lot of other infrastructure to support the
kind of airtight archival that you're suggesting.

I think this is well beyond the scope of the discussion most of this
list is interested in.  The web is the Internet's version of instant
gratification, a 90s kind of thing.  Long lived?  Future?  Lawyers?
Naw.

Steve

Because you want some form of vetting on the names, or a mechanism to
detect when things are compromised, or any number of things.

Which gets back to the real essence of the argument - that if it costs
more to break the protection you have than you lose if it's broken,
There is no point in going to a more expensive protection mechanism.

> The issue isn't whether the ordinary *user* is competent to mount a

The issue isn't about who's going to mount the attack, it's about the
cost of the attack vs. the value of what's being protected. This is,
ultimately, a decision that can only be made by the person who's going
to lose if the protection is broken. Hopefully, they have a good
understanding of the cost of breaking the protection when they make
that decisions.

I can think of such applications. I've even seen things on the web
that look like they would benefit from such an application. It may
even be possible to make money on such an application.

This is often known as 'Yellow Ribbon Security'. You know how
sometimes around a scene of an investigation, they'll put up a yellow
plastic ribbon around the scene, that says "police line, do not
cross". The yellow ribbon provides no physical protection at all.

In the case of electronic communication, yellow-ribbon security is
useful in those cases where there is an auxiliary channel for vetting
the information, and the possible loss from having the password
compromised is minimal.

For example, in a typical "you can order stuff over the internet"
scheme, there is an external mechanism for establishing an account
(e.g., you supply address, phone number, credit card info over the
telephone, and this information is verified independently). You then
get a account and password. You can use this account and password to
order things (up to a reasonably small maximum order), but the orders
can only be shipped to the billing address of the credit card.

All network transactions are logged; if a fraudulent transaction is
entered (e.g., someone orders something in your name to be delivered
at your address, but you didn't order it), the vendor is willing to
accept the return, and initiates an investigation into the source of
the fraudulent transaction.

In this application, the possible gain from the misuse of the password
is small (e.g., it mainly just gives anyone who has obtained your
password in a fraudulent manner the opportunity to harass you, but not
any particular financial gain.)

Similarly, services that sell 'information' over the network may well
be able to use passwords that are transmitted in the clear. If you get
a bill for searching a newspaper database that is above and beyond
your normal bill, it is relatively simple for the vendor to reverse
the charges and initiate an investigation into the cause of the
fraudulent use.

Flat-rate online services that only allow one connection at a time
from a given user might well use unencrypted passwords; again, the
possible potential gain to the unauthorized user is minimal, the risk
to the purchaser and the vendor is small.

I believe that it is necessary to deploy the technology that actually
allows secure transactions over the Internet, and that the net will be
more functional when it is available, but it is mainly because there
are enough situations where lower security is adequate and also more
convenient that has hampered that deployment.

The issue is not so black and white to me.  There is a continuous
range of secured-ness of the various solutions from none to (theoretically)
unbreakable.  If I am willing to take some risk, and I do not otherwise
jeopardize existing network security (such as using login passwords),
then it would seem I should be free to implement whatever suits my
needs.  I am only jeopardizing my own secrets, so it should be my own
business how I handle it.

On the otherhand, if I want to rely on login passwords (ie someone else's
secrets), then that is another matter and one is expected to conform to
some minimal level of standards.  From your previous email, I assume this
minimal level is S/Key.

Steve, is this a reasonable tact ?  Can the problem be divided into these
two sets ?

Well - the key for over-the-wire-access and the key for access from
archival storage could conceivably be different, n'est ce pas?

A sort of archive client-server within the server...

Nope - this is a real problem.  Most of the people dealing with these
problems (guessing) work for large corporations or three-letter
government organizations.

I'll give an example we're doing now.  We're putting up a set of web pages
describing HCI programs at universities around the world.  Read access will
be open.  Write access, using forms, will be controlled by a simple
password (per institution, sent in a field in the update form) so that
people can update the entries for their own institutions.  Since the update
is on a per-entry basis (the form you get back when you click the "edit"
button is for the page on which you found it) it isn't convenient to do
this by simply having a separate (unadvertised) space of URLs for updating.


This amount of security means that a random student logging on to look
around the set of pages won't be able to change a page just out of
curiosity to see what happens.  Anybody who is going to bother with putting
a sniffer on the net is going to have better things to do than to put
graffiti on course descriptions, and if they do the worse that happens is
somebody looks foolish until they discover it and correct it.

It's easy to agree with Steve that passwords-in-the-clear are
unacceptable, and still believe that there are cases where
shared-secret authentication is all you need (presumably because you
don't want to pay either the license fees, complexity or computer time
for some public key based authentication scheme).

There are many problem with password schemes, but the worst ones are, I think:
        1. Both parties will be tempted to send the password over the net
	   in the clear.
        2. Both parties will be tempted to store the password in the clear.
        3. Its a pain to set-up the password between the parties the first
	   time.
        4. Its a pain to remember the password (manage all one's passwords).
        5. Its tempting to use bad (guessable) passwords.

These problems interact somewhat (the better the passwords you use, the
more likely you need to store them on paper). And since passwords
authenticate the message channel, rather than the messages themselves,
password authentication is weak in a fundamental sense. Someday, we'll
all be using public key based schemes -- after 2000 for sure :-).

On the other hand, passwords are familiar, simple and better than
nothing (modulo a "false security" problem). Most of the problems
enumerated above are tough, but on today's Internet, problem #1 is
special, and it can be addressed pretty easily.

The next revision of the Secure HTTP specification provides a
shared-secret authentication scheme which:
        1. Never sends passwords over the net in the clear.
        2. Prevents splicing attacks (guarantees message integrity).
        3. Doesn't use patented techniques (as best I can determine).
        4. Doesn't use cryptography (freely exportable).
        5. Provides protection against replay attacks.
        6. Is reasonably simple.

The message being authenticated is preceeded by a message digest header
as follows:
        MAC-Info: <hash-alg>,<key-id>,<timecode>,<hash-value>
where:
        timecode      is seconds since the epoch (unsigned 32-bit in hex)
        key-id        can be considered the "account name"
        hash-alg      e.g., "RSA-MD5", "NIST-SHS"
        hash-value    is hash(shared-key || timecode || message) in hex

Use of the timecode by the communicating parties to deter replay
attacks is at their discretion.

Peter L. Rosencrans and Joanne Eglash (they span the globe) for their
quick and informative replies to my plea for help.  First, they corrected

I'm encountering an unusal behaviour of NCSA Windows Mosaic v2.0a4 to a6
which do not display two images side by side with the following tag in a
html doc:

<img src="pic-1.gif" alt="[LOGO]"><img src="pic-2.gif" alt="[SYMBOL]"><br>

It works fine when I use X Mosaic 2.4. What's wrong? Could it be a
bug?

(P.S. The images are very small of sizes 4000 and 3000 bytes. I'm using
      lviewp16 as viewer.)

This is a very bad assumption... the phrase "weakest link in the chain"
comes to mind.

Having had to clean up after them on occasion I feel safe in saying that
crackers will try to get into any account, however pointless, for one of
three reasons:

    1) Just for the hell of it.
    2) Vandalism.
    3) Using the account as a stepping stone to crack the rest of the
       system.

I'm not going to deny the utility of yellow-ribbon security in some
limited situations but you have to be *very* careful... What often
happens is that once a "security" mechanism has been installed for one
purpose, it's get used for another, and another.... and somehow the the
assumptions made by the original implementors are never examined quite
as closely as they should be...

Oh well, time to get off the horse :-)

	Something Reed said made me start thinking (again) about 
metadata/metainfo,  information about an object (document) that 
might not be, or might not should be,  or might not be able to be 
embedded in the file itself.   Things like timestamps,  size,  etc. 
Even ownership and sometimes authorship. 
 
	It was expiration and cycle time.   Yeah ... that was it. 
Two of the meta-values,  which are kinda distinct,  are an expiration 
date and a cycle time or cache time-out.   Once an expiration date 
is reached,  you can the object.   But a cycle time is different: 
you try to get a new copy.   If it doesn't exist,  then you can your 
local copy.   Otherwise you simply refresh it.   A proxy server will 
typically have just a global cycle time,  unless it's smart enough 
to acquire and understand a per-object cycle time. 
 
	These are the kinds of values that we can put into HTML, 
but not into other markups/languages,  plain text,  PostScript,  etc.

The document
	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html
claims that to redirect a document, you return a
	URI: Url String CrLf
line with a 301 or 302 response code.  In practise, all the library
code and server code that I've seen sends back
	Location: Url
lines, and doesn't even *look* for URI:.

Is URI deprecated, wishful thinking, backward compatible, a crock, or
what?

This is a bit out of line for this group, I realize, but I'm running  
into a fill-out-forms problem again and again that just stumps me.

I have a form (http://etext.virginia.edu/ME-test.html) that takes a  
query, sends it to a database, and returns a list of keyword in context  
(KWIC) entries to the user.  So far, no problem.

Each of these KWIC views is an HTML anchor to a larger view (1500  
characters of context balanced around the beginning of the searched  
word).  However, I would like to make it possible for the user to choose  
different views from the KWIC entry -- a view of the specific page, 3000  
characters of context, 1500 characters of context, a bibliographic  
entry, the entire work.

To see what this would look like, try the following:

http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/me-test?type=Single+word+or+phrase&query=lo 
ndes+go

Now this obviously doesn't work.  I've tried a number of things,  
including making each result a radio button selection.  What I don't  
like about that is that you then have to choose a result and then make  
your way back up to the top to press the [submit] button, a real pain in  
the butt when you've got 100 items.

I wonder if there's any way to offer someone a set of options (the view  
options in this case) that get registered as an environment variable  
without submitting the form, so that after this one can choose an item  
and have it be affected by the choice made earlier.

Sorry this is so muddle-headed.  It's hard to describe without being  
able to point to the screen.

Windows httpd sends back Location: followed by URI: I wondered the same thing, but

My business partner Lotus Notes specialist, and was preparing a response 
to a "WWW is pathetic compared to Notes" that was full of misinformation.

One thing I couldn't adequately back him up on was the WWW equivalent of 
replication.  I just don't see (maybe I'm not looking in the right 
places) very much discussion of server-server transactions on the web.

Things I have seen are:
-cache managers
-URNs
-HTTP version numbers (in the spec)
-a post (Dan Connolly, I think) about using netnews for "broadcast" docs

Martijn Koster has one of the first, I think, in distributing ALIWEB, but 
even he recommends ftp-mirroring of the data!

There seem to be facilities in the specs, and I'm sure people are 
working on it, but I don't have anything to argue with for a distributed 
read/write, replicated, versioning system.

Thanks for any enlightenment.

Location: was the originally proposed header and then was switched to URI:
later on.  Use of Location: is deprecated but is still "the standard"
until everyone switches to URI: (which also sports other neat features
like vary=...).

I also noticed that if a CGI script under NCSA httpd outputs a
Location: header, the server intercepts this and turns it into a 30x
error, but if you output a URL: header it reaches the client
unchanged...

CGI parsers are supposed to interpret "Location:" headers to check to see
if it's a local file. This should only happen for scripts which don't return 
a Status header - if a Status header is returned, the Location should be passed
through untouched.

Nope - this is close to impossible - the current specs only allow one
submit button per form, and you can't save state from one transmission
to the next (unless you want to start managing session IDs) - so all
variables must be submitted each time.  But you can embed the variable
in the URLs:
   How about this (URLs omitted for clarity)
	(Note the use of Path_INFO to provide the variable you mentioned)
<LI>
 <A http://url/100?querystring>word</A> (<A http://url/500?querystring>500</A>)
                             words  or  (<A http://url/all?querystring>all</A>)

Which renders as:
 * _word_  (_500_ words or _all_)

Of course you can add more in there - note that the query string after 
the ? is independent of the pathinfo, which makes this easy to extend.

	I,m behind most of the people on this list, and could use some 
help here and there. Anyone with the willingness and ability to help 
answer some Q.'s? The answers are beyond me.
	One problem:
	I run internet through the Unix system. I want to do 2 things:
	1. 'Download' files I've received through e-mail to a disk in 
such a way to be able to read them on Ami-Pro or windows 'Write' program. 
Is this possible, and how do I do it?
	2. Save the files I accumulate from e-mail to a disk in such a 
way as to read them on those 2 programs. I need this step by step.
	3. Are other word processors better for this? 
	What I'm really asking is what do you people do with your e-mail 
files and files sent to you over Internet, and how can I do that?
	For any and all help I receive, Thank You Much!! My files are a 
mess, and the system manager is ready to evict me.

You could use hidden fields in the form to store status
eg
<input type="hidden"  name="status" value="put status info here ">

I've made this work quite well in a search screen. If you need lots 
of status you can of course add more hidden fields - status1, status2 
etc.

(BTW why can we only have 1 submit button per form - allowing more 
would improve the quality of forms interfaces no end, and doesn't 
seem technically difficult?)

Or if you have a whole mess of stuff you need to store, a sneakier
way to do it would be to store everything in /tmp under a unique
filename (perhaps named for the first PID the user is assigned) and
then just pass the PID (or filename) from form to form.

  It is trivial to send the 'name' of a submit field, which I believe was
decided on as a 'Good Thing' on this list several months ago.  The emacs-w3
browser did this for a while, and it is very handy.  But lots of
poorly-written forms interfaces didn't like the extra field in the
submitted xxx=yyy&zzz=1111 type thing.

  Another thing that is very useful (which of course the emacs browser does
:) is the use of alternate ACTION attributes on submit buttons.

This is really a slick feature which I wasn't aware of so far. Is this
an undocumented feature ? This is not mentioned in the FORMs overview document
(http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html)
Is there any other document out there with these kind of features?

Is the INPUT tag with TYPE= "hidden" respected by the Mosaic clients other
than Xmosaic?

Thanks for the info!

It is documented, but not in the introductory documents - I had some 
problems tracking down the details myself. It is documented at:
http://www.hal.com/users/connolly/html-spec/Elements/INPUT.html

(There is a thorough listing of forms features starting at:
http://www.hal.com/users/connolly/html-spec/Forms.html)

I don't know of any other documents using hidden fields - but I 
haven't been looking for them!

Good question - it should be, but I heard that some WWW clients were 
displaying hidden fields! No doubt the more it gets used, the more 
clients will treat it properly.

For an example of hidden fields in use view
http://indigo.stile.le.ac.uk/~sgj/STILE/index.html
click on the Search link, then view the source of the resulting 
document. (It's an experimental search engine that allows exploration 
of our part of the web by finding commonly linked documents.)

This is quite a bit out of date -- see  
http://www.hal.com/users/connolly/html-spec/ for the latest draft  
version.

Once the HTML 2.0 spec is finalized I'm sure the information will be  
widely distributed.

It does?  Excellent!  That means it's "existing practice"
and maybe it's not too late to get this into the official 
HTML specification.

Personally I'd like to see FORMs redone entirely, but 
that seems unlikely.

    Emacs-w3 supports this.  WINMosaic (and hence AIRMosaic) supports the 
hidden
type.  Not sure about MacMosaic.  Haven't bothered to check WinWeb, since it 
has
some severe bugs in the formatting which make it basically unusable for me at
work or at home.

I'd personally like an optional ACTION attribute to any type of button
in a FORM.  If it was not specifed, the submit-button would work as
normal.  Sometimes the standard method would be perferred, but one
also would have the option of using "real" buttons too.

It seems worthwhile to have a Finger URL, comments please.

-Reed Wade



Finger URL


finger://<hostport>/[<type>/]<user>

examples:

        finger://cs.utk.edu/text%2fhtml/info
        finger://cs.utk.edu/wade


hostport
	what you think it means

type
	If the type field is present it refers to a MIME content type.
	The result of the finger lookup should return data of this type.
	Note that /'s must be escaped.

	If type is ommited it defaults to text/plain but with one
	difference: <UR?:xxx>'s found in the text stream should be
	made selectable by WWW browsers. If this feature is not desired,
	text/plain should be indicated explicitly.

user
	The data for the finger lookup. Encoded NEWLINES are not permitted.

SNMP URL

snmp://<hostport>/1/<community>/<command>/<OID>[/<value>]

examples:

	snmp://blah.tuna.com/1/public/Get/0.1.3.768

	snmp://squid.cs.utk.edu/1/public/GetNext/0


hostport
	what you think it means
	
1
	Indicates SNMP URL version 1--the URL, not the version
	of SNMP. This is a hook to allow changes to the URL
	such as incorporation of security information. [If we
	can describe a comprehesive URL now then maybe this can 
	go away.]

community
	SNMP community string

command
	One of: get, set, getnext, gettable, getall. This value
	is not case sensitive.

	Get performs a normal SNMP Get request.

	Set performs a normal SNMP Set request using the contents
	of the value field.

	GetNext performs a normal SNMP GetNext request.

	GetTable gets the entire contents of the table refered to by
	the OID field.

	GetAll walks the entire database (using SNMP GetNext requests)
	beginning after OID. (OID is used for the first GetNext
	request.)

OID
	This is the numeric dotted decimal object identifier in common use.
	There is no provision for named objects. [Maybe we could provide
	for the common ones tho.]

value
	If the command is "set" the value portion of the URL is
	used. If value is ommited, it is assumed to be NULL.

Subject: Virtual Circuit protocols => universal access
Date: Sun, 21 Aug 1994 13:40:45 -0500
From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 3481


I take back many of the nasty things I said about using virtual-
circuit based protocols (e.g. HTTP over TCP/IP) for wWW. I had an
experience the other day that changed my mind.

I downloaded the complete binary distribution for SRC Modula-3,
release 3.3, a 15MB file, from someplace in Canada to my PC at home
in about 3 hours, while I entertained myself reading news etc.

How's this for a virtual circuit:

* On my PC running linux, I log in over a 14.4KBPS dialup connection
to ausblazer, HaL's modem bank terminal server, and rlogin to
austin2. There I start rterm on that end, exit my terminal emulator
(without hanging up), and start term on my end.

Term is an application that essentially implements the features of
SLIP or PPP in a user process -- except that it works at the TCP
level (virtual circuit), not at the IP level (datagram). rterm is
term compiled for SOCKS, i.e. -Dconnect=Rconnect etc.

* Back on my linux PC, I invoke:
 % tncftp ftp://ftp.vlsi.polymtl.ca/pub/m3/linux/src-m3-3.3l1.tar.gz

ncftp is an ftp client with added some features, e.g. understadning
URI's.  tncftp is ncftp with the socket API calls replaced by term API
calls.

* ncnftp opens a unix domain socket to the term server process on my
Pc, and initiates a TCP connection to ftp.vlsi.polymtl.ca.

* term and rterm establish a channel (the 14.4 connection is
multiplexed!), and rterm initiates a connection to ftp.vlsi.polymtl.ca
via a T1 connection to HaL's SOCKS server in california.

* the connection is established, and the tncftp client on my box
begins conversing over this perverse virtual circuit with the FTP
server on ftp.vlsi.polymtl.ca. To review, it's

tncftp@linux --TERM/unix socket--> term@linux --TERM/RS232-->
	rlogin@ausblazer --TCP/IP/ethernet--> rterm@austin2
	--TCP/IP/T1--> socks@hal.com --TCP/IP/??-->ftp@ftp.vlsi.polymtl.ca

* Meanwhile, I have another term connection between my box and
austin2, over which I read my mail and news, and surf the Modula3
documentation at DEC with Mosiac+term.

So the point, I guess, is that virtual circuits are well-understood,
and can be optimized for various network topologies and technologies,
and they're the only consumer technology networking available today.

[Another point, of course, is that linux is cool! Widely tested
binaries of all your favorite apps available on FTP servers, if
not on CD rom for <$50. And, of course, the source for everything
is available if you're so inclined. Support and documentation are
a bit raw, but they're coming -- the economies of scale are kicking
in! See the Linux Documentation project welcome page:
	http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html
for complete info]

So while request-response protocols like ARDP and TTCP may be optimal
for distibuted hypermedia applications, the success of WWW is rooted
in its widespread accessability, not it's high-tech features. Mosaic
and lynx are easy to use, and HTML and URL's are easy to understand;
hence WWW has become nearly consumer technology. It has clearly
advanced beyond research/engineering/hacker technology into the
business communications arena. And it's only a matter of time before
high bandwidth connection to the home becomes ubiquitous.

In a few years, we'll want to upgrade to more optimal protocols, so
we need to research them now, but virual circuits are not passe. Not
as long as the modem-connected user base outnumbers the
digital-connected userbase (be it ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, ATM, etc.)
by, say, 1000 to 1.

	Hmmm...   I think I'd prefer for the server to munge things 
like this.   I started work just last week on an HTML "finger" agent. 
The package has two sides:  text/plain  and  text/html.   The URL should 
allow the client to request either.

Until all of the services on the net are moderately secure, this WILL happen
if we support something like a finger URL.  Of course, gopher: already
allows you to do this, if you are clever.

This is even a bigger problem than it might be, given the terrifically bad 
idea of running caching servers.  (IMHO)

It took me sometime to acknowledge that we should be careful what we 
allow the abberant user.  I used to think that we as technologists should 
not have to be placed in the position of having to arbitrate "acceptable 
use" of the tools we write, by limiting their effectiveness.

Some days I still think this way.  You caught me on the other day.

Well, think about the possibilities with a Web server where people are posting their 
personal home pages. Or somebody with a web server running on their Mac or PC.

What's the difference? Why quash a good idea?

Actually, John Kilburg (john@mayall.CS.UNLV.EDU) has convinced me that
the server end  ought to decide what the content type is. Instead of 
putting it in the URL as I originally suggested it ought to be in the 
first line of the returned data (like an http response). If this 
information doesn't appear then treat it like text/plain.

I think if we try to make it any cleverer than this, it'd make more
sense to just go ahead and use an http server.

Uh... I don't know if I see the relation between your good experiences
downloading to your PC and the VC/DG discussion. The issue is not a
matter of bandwidth, or even that of ease of programming (both VC's and
datagrams are media independent, and as long as you have something
like libwww, why should one care?)

I agree with your notion that supporting modem access is going to be
something of an ongoing concern. However, the most popular current scheme
is to setup SLIP/PPP and use everything as normal. The only big advantage
of this over a dedicated transfer protocol (like Kermit) is that SLIP
presumably takes care of multiplexing multiple connections.  In practice,
once you start a single BIG transfer, since no-one takes care to implement
load-throttling, you might as well be directly connected through one
session, because everything else comes to a halt.

I have seen some incredibly cool asynchronous protocols implemented over 
serial lines that allow you to continue working while a transfer is
in progress. SoftArc's First Class and certain versions of Blast immediately 
come to mind. And through gateways, you can basically perform what you
would over SLIP. 

The issue is not VC versus DG's. TCP is just one implementation of
VC's over a datagram layer. Those who don't like TCP's default overhead
for certain media and applications argue for doing a simpler DG-based
protocol. I personally think it's all irrelevant since the debate is
not about functionality but about performance. And since there
are a lot more areas where you can squeeze performance, the VC/DG
issue is something of an academic exercise best left to the readers (;-)

I say we go ahead and dispense with the VC<->DG debate. I prefer the RPC
vs. Messaging one. Should libwww just switch to RPC and do away with
this HTTP protocol business. Anyone? >;-)

Cheers,
R.

I like the idea of a finger URL.  I also made a simple implementation
and found it useful "In Real Life".  In general, the syntax seems OK,
but it raises a more global issue:

Should temporal or site-specific information be encoded in a URL syntax ?
I am refering to the "type" and think in general that this is trouble.

1. Similar syntax is not generally used for other protocols.  Skipping
the new Gopher, the only other is FTP.  However its type is critical
to obtaining uncorrupted data, and can be specified by the author.

2. It opens the door for other temporal- and site-specific items such
as "If-Modified-Since", and other "Accept" items like quality, etc.
which I think are beyond the scope of URL's and also cannot be known
by the author.

3. The author cannot know how to publish such a URL.  Thus, it must always
be published without such information and hence its value is questionable.

4. The data stream conversion will have to be done by the client or the
proxy.  If the former, then the URL syntax doesn't help as the client
can do this (better) without it being in the URL.  If the latter, then we
are propogating the need for (yet another) filter in proxies.  How will
this be controlled ?  What if there's a URL with "text/html" but I
don't want it converted ?


It seems that URL's are trying to grow beyond a global object reference
and are expanding into the realm of wanting to define a virtual access
protocol.

There is clearly a need for information such as "Content-Type" at some level
in the access process, but perhaps not in the URL syntax which must be
useful to authors.

I would propose:

A. finger return MIME type "application/x-finger"

B. Content-Type in general not be made part of URL's

C. we think harder about how to specify filtering/conversion during the
access process in more general terms (including the conversion of
"application/x-finger" into "text/html" with hyperlinks, etc.).  Some
ideas....
        1. assume you always have a proxy and use HTTP protocol syntax,
                where "Accept: text/html" really works and will convert
                the fingerd output to what you want; and
                "Accept: application/x-finger" gives you the raw output.
        2. define a virtual access protocol that contains HTTP-like
                items (with maybe even an API) that can be translated
                into a best fit on the protocol specified in the URL.
                This could actually be HTTP, just filtered/translated
                mapped in the protocol module.

        Mike

p.s. Reed - Sorry about using your finger proposal for this point, but
seemed like the right opportunity.

Indeed.  When it was discussed before, it was acknowledged that
prohibiting newlines (by newline do you mean a CR, an LF, a CRLF, or
what?) did seem to address the currently known risks.  I don't know
that anyone has done a thorough analysis of all of the hundreds of
Internet protocols in use to determine whether any of them have
potential security concerns from entries not containing newlines.

With finger, it's easier to deal with.  Unlike gopher or http, nobody
runs finger daemons on ports other than 79.  Just restrict
specification of other ports.

Eventually, reluctanty the idea of prohibiting newlines was
acknowledged even though it had the risk of becoming a permanent,
rather than an quick-and-dirty, solution.  Some browsers don't even
implement that solution and still allow mail-forging.

At any rate, the specification needs to be a bit more explicit.  How
does one specify indirect finger queries per section 2.4 of RFC 1288?
How about verbose queries via the /W token?

As the ALIWEB databse is a single file, the overhead of FTP over HTTP
isn't that bad. The reason I recommend FTP over HTTP is that no client
I know of rejects (or even acknowledges) truncated transfers, which
are likely to happen when a server enforces timeouts on long transfers
over slow links.

[Putting his publisher hat on]

Because anyone running a caching server runs the dual risk of presenting 
out-of-date information to their users and can be in direct violation of 
international copyright law.

The first point is by far the most important in my mind.  As more and 
more professional publishers come online, you will see this becoming 
much more of an issue.  

The publisher holds complete responsibility over their product, in
content, presentation, timeliness and distribution.  By running a caching
server on my content, you are robbing me of any control I might have over
the timeliness and distribution. 

You can provide no guarantee that the versions that you present to your
users are accurate or timely.  Further, I have no idea of the number of
consumers who view my content through your cache or what they view, how
and when. 

Even assuming that you are acting in good faith, there are many kinds of 
information which have value because of their timeliness.  Daily news and 
stock quotes are two which immediately come to mind.

Of course, I can mark my information as being uncacheable, but will you
honor that request?  Your interest is to provide content to your users
with as little impact on your communications resources as possible.  I
believe that your goals and mine are not compatible. 

The copyright issue is the more difficult one.   In light of the previous 
argument, you are archiving an original work.  This is called "copying" 
in copyright law and if it is done without permission, is against the law.

(I'm ignoring any arguments that copyright law must be redesigned in light
of digital distribution.  I don't think anyone would disagree with this. 
However, I doubt that copyright is going away and in fact, I expect the
body of law will be strengthened not diluted.)

I expect that most professional publishers will not serve content to any 
site which caches unless they can enter into a business relationship with 
that site.  Unfortunately, this presents a very interesting N by N 
problem, as publishers and caching servers proliferate.

Of course, I could be wrong.  I have only been peripherally associated 
with publishers.  Anyone from O'Reilly wish to comment?

My argument was that virtual circuit technology is more widely
deployed, presumably because it's easier to "tunnel" VC's inside each
other than to encapsulate datagrams. I think the conclusion that VC's
are more widely deployed holds (I believe the Merit statistics report
that FTP, HTTP, and Gopher constitute over 50% of all packets on the
internet), but I don't know if I have correctly identified the cause.

This was not my experience. term does some sort of priorities or
something.  In any case, I noticed only a small change in the
responsiveness of my mail/news/Mosaic sessions that were concurrent
with my FTP download.

Are we using different terminology for the same thing, or am I really
confused about these terms? To my mind, HTTP _is_ an RPC protocol:
the client sends a request, and the server answers. That's why I think
it's overkill to use TCP.

Or by RPC do you mean Sun RCP with their stubgen and all that? Or
would DCE RPC, or ILU RPC do the trick?

Could you elaborate on the distinction between RPC and messaging?

Sure.  Note that I don't know much about the mechanics
of caching servers, so if I'm off base in some way,
please let me know.

Our issue with caching servers has to do with accounting
of use in GNN (Global Network Navigator).  To make GNN
freely available, we sell advertising.  In order for an
advertiser to feel that they are making a worthwhile
investment, they want to know how many people are reading
their content.  We can determine the number of `hits' on
a given part of GNN, but only if we have access to usage
logs.  If someone's accessing GNN through a caching 
server, we only know about one hit, plus additional hits
each time the cache entry expires.

In Neil Smith's paper `What can Archives offer the World 
Wide Web,' there's a table (fig. 7) that lists `the most 
popular remote sites accessed via the UNIX HENSA cache.'  
Our main GNN site, nearnet.gnn.com, is up there at the 
top, with approximately 4000 accesses.  I haven't gone
through our logs to check specifically for accesses 
from the HENSA caching server, but I would guess that
the number is substantially less than 4000.  (From the
paper, the HENSA server will expire GNN non-GIF files
after two days, and GIF files after two weeks.  Here's
a real-life ramification of caching: for those using 
the HENSA server, our daily Dilbert comic strip is 
available only once every two weeks.)

One solution would be for caching servers to generate
a summary of hits on URLs `belonging' to particular 
servers, and to email that summary to a standard 
email address at those servers.  So even though we 
at GNN may not receive the level of detail that we 
get from our own logs (timestamp, hostnames, URLs), 
we could at least receive from the caching servers 
an approximation which we could integrate into our 
reports back to our advertisers.

Comments?

  [Putting his publisher hat on]

Let's see how this goes if we substitute "book store" for "caching server"
  
  Because anyone running a caching server runs the dual risk of presenting 
  out-of-date information to their users and can be in direct violation of 
  international copyright law.

Yes, a book store could sell the old edition or let its customers Xerox books 
and never pay the publisher.  Bookstores even get to return unsold books for 
credit.  For paperbacks, at least, they don't even have to return the whole 
book, only the cover.  They can (and some do) sell the rest (this is 
physically possible, not legal).
  
  The publisher holds complete responsibility over their product, in
  content, presentation, timeliness and distribution.  By running a caching
  server on my content, you are robbing me of any control I might have over
  the timeliness and distribution. 

Yes, as does the bookstore.
  
  You can provide no guarantee that the versions that you present to your
  users are accurate or timely.  Further, I have no idea of the number of
  consumers who view my content through your cache or what they view, how

Yes
  
  Even assuming that you are acting in good faith, there are many kinds of 
  information which have value because of their timeliness.  Daily news and

Yes, the bookstore should pull yesterday's newspapers and put out todays.

  honor that request?  Your interest is to provide content to your users
  with as little impact on your communications resources as possible.  I

Well, my bookstore would be a lot more profitable if I could get the New York 
Times shipped by one week ground.
  
  The copyright issue is the more difficult one.   In light of the previous 
  argument, you are archiving an original work.  This is called "copying" 
  in copyright law and if it is done without permission, is against the law.

If I have the book on my shelf without having gotten it through a legitimate 
chain of transactions leading back to the publisher, I have also broken some 
laws.

  I expect that most professional publishers will not serve content to any 
  site which caches unless they can enter into a business relationship with 
  that site.  Unfortunately, this presents a very interesting N by N

Yes, this is an issue for bookstores too, and all other forms of retail 
commerce, actually.  That's why wholesalers and distributors, the infamous 
"middlemen" of common parlance, exist. 
  
My flipness aside, there are issues here, but they are issues which are 
amenable to technical solutions.  There are lots of authentication mechanisms 
for insuring that a publisher only "sells" to a "distributor" (cache) that she 
trusts, and to sign time critical material to that it identifiable as reliably 
as a newspaper is by the date on the top.  If anything, our problem is 
choosing among the alternatives, which is a problem largely because the 
choosing may decide a lot of things about who get rich from this new 
technology.

	I can't express this strongly enough without using wording 
that would alienate some people: 
 
		hidden fields are awkward at best 
 
		"overloaded paths" in the URL are bad 
 
	Recommend putting  state information  and other optional 
parameters after a (yet to be implemented on some servers) 
semi-colon ";" and before the question mark "?". 
 
	Here's a real-life example: 
 
		http://vm.rice.edu/local/problem,read?number=20186 
 
	(substitute semi-colon for the comma) 
 
	The token "read" is bit of state information passed from 
one page to the next.   The page that gives me this URL is a "list". 
We also have a "post" operation.   There's no reason why these 
parameters can't be of the form  statevar=somevalue.   As long as they 
fall  *before*  that blessed question mark,  your clients will cope. 
Using semi-colon or even comma sure beats the confusion of another slash. 
 
	I tried implementing this will hidden fields and everyone puked.

Yes, these are risks. This is why I believe it is necessary to have
	(1) a formal model of computation to decide, in the abstract
		what the "correct" answer to a user's query is, and
	(2) widely deployed fault detection and tolerance mechanisms
		to increase reliability of actual computations, to detect
		errors, and to generally promote confidence in digital
		communications.

(see http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/drafts/formalism.html for
an attempt at such a formalism)

>You can provide no guarantee that the versions that you present to your

This is extremely misleading, if not just plain incorrect. While there
are no guarantees (and no fault detection mechanisms...) the HTTP
protocol (as specified, and as implemented by NCSA HTTP and CERN HTTP,
as far as I know) ensures that caching proxy servers do not compromise
the protocol by serving up out-of-date information. When a client does
a GET, the caching proxy is bound by the Expires: information
associated with its cached representation of an object. If there is
none, it must do a round trip to the server of origin. This round trip
is often optimized with the If-Modified-Since mechanism.

Do you have a right to know this? There was a lot of talk at the WWW
conference in Geneva about a "Bill of Rights" for the information age.
This is an interesting issue to add to the list.

>Of course, I can mark my information as being uncacheable, but will you

I suspect these issues can generally be addressed by the conventional
whining to the administrators to get these policies enforced. If your
data is so valuable that this level of reliability is unacceptable,
you will have to employ more complex protocols, presumably employing
cryptographic techniques to provide authenticity, accountability,
etc. Any information that has a more restrictive copyright than, for
example, the MIT X11 copyright has no business travelling over
conventional HTTP.

This is true. Most folks that put info on the web are either academics
or marketing types. Both of these camps gain, rather than lose, when
their info is redistributed without their knowledge. Folks that have
something to lose by the redistribution of their information typically
use physically secure networks, today.

But this will change with the emergence of cryptographic security
techniques...

Well, it certainly sounds like the protocol needs a time-to-live, now 
doesn't it? Or at least a digest of the file to be compared against short

There are very few places where it makes sense to replace a 
connection-oriented reliable transport protocol with an unreliable 
connectionless protocol. These cases tend to be those where:

1) The typical transaction consists of a single outgoing datagram for
   the request, followed by a single datagram containing the response.

2) The typical transaction profile consists of many queries issued to 
   separate hosts.

3) Operations are idempotent.

4) The loss of a certain amount of data is acceptable.

If a service doesn't fit with this set of criteria then there is very little
point in moving to a connectionless protocol. 

Example: DNS

	DNS sends a single packet for a query, and recieves a single packet 
	in return. Typical DNS queries span multiple hosts. Thus the cost of 
	connection establishment is too high for this type of service.

	HTTP generates two datagrams for each query (or at least X-mosaic does),
	and recieves a large number of datagrams back in response. The typical
	transaction profile consists of many queries to a single host. HTTP 
	POST operations are not idempotent. The loss of data is not considered
	acceptable. Therefore HTTP is not well suited to a connectionless 
	paradigm.

	Saying  "it's overkill to use TCP"  really really scares me. 
Maybe it's just because I'm familiar with TCP and not with RPC. 
More likely it's because I see the elegance of a different paradigm: 
streams,  not functions.   Functions are great,  but when you try to 
"portablize" them,  they're not as great.

	Messaging is cool.   How do you feel about messaging kernels? 
I think they're great.   But in a kernel (for example) you have a 
much more reliable "transport".   One could still lose "packets", 
but it's not quite the given for a kernel that it is for IP. 
 
	If you want messaging to be "reliable" in/on IP,  you have to 
build  something_like  TCP on top of it.   Maybe (probably!) what you 
build will be more efficient (for the web) than TCP,  but it completely 
destroys the stream model.   Not that you can't fashion some new and 
more wonderful stream model,  but I'll have to create or use completely 
new tools.   That's expensive.

What about a reliable, connectionless protocol, like ARDP? (Well, it's
not really any more or less connectionless than TCP, but there is no
connection establishment overhead in ARDP).

>	HTTP generates two datagrams for each query (or at least X-mosaic does)

The fact that Mosaic's request are more than one datagram is a big,
fat, BUG. It sends:

	GET <url> HTTP/1.0
	User-Agent: Mosaic xxx...
	Accept: text/html
	Accept: text/plain
	Accept: image/gif
		... (ad nauseum) ...
	Accept: */*

Note that the last Accept: */* obviates the need for all the others, since
cost/quality qualifiers aren't specified. Except for some form submission
requests, requests should nearly always fit in one datagram. Any client
that implements a "save to disk" feature should just send
	Accept: */*
unless it supports a feature where the user can specify preferences of
one format over another. Any client that does _not_ implement a "save
to disk" feature (like lynx in -anonymous mode) should explicitly list
the supported content types.

Yes, but those queries are not conducted over the same connection, nor
should they be, except in the case of inlined images. Short connections
is one of the major wins of gopher/HTTP typical usage over FTP typical usage.
No server resources are consumed while the client user browses.

HTTP POST is certainly an exception. But to really meet the requirements
of POST, you need real distributed transactions, with two-phase-commit or
something like that.

Simple: the HENSA server is broken.

You wrote:

I took the "You" in that sentence to mean you, the caching server
administrator. It is simply not true that the HENSA server
administrator _can not_ provide a reasonable guarantee that his
readers get timely information. This is why I spoke up: so that
www-talk readers don't come away thinking what you said is the only
way it can be.

It's a simple matter of server configuration.  As I recall, the CERN
http daemon's default configuration is "correct" as per the protocol,
i.e. it doesn't do any heuristic caching -- it only caches HTTP
requests with an explicit Expires: header in the response. They do
document the configuration options for heuristics like "cache FTP
stuff for 2 days."

I think it's even possible to say "cache GIFs for two weeks, except
for the dilbert comics from ora.com," if you're so inclined.

The point is: please don't generalize certain broken installations and
implementations into a condemnation of the WWW architecture as a
whole. I agree that WWW has a long way to go before it is consumer
technology, but perception has a lot to do with it's deployment. Let's
not give the wrong impression at this critical stage.

So, it's not just caching servers per se but any form of shared, persistent
caching that you object to.  Yes?

It depends how the cache is implemented. If it checks currency with the
original (e.g. via a HEAD or a conditional GET) it can indeed make such a
guarantee, and the original server still has an accurate record of how
often pages are being viewed.  Of course, such a system makes the cache
less of a win because only bandwidth time, rather than round-trip-times,
is heavily saved.  Any reasonable cache would behave in this way given
an appropriate expiration time.

A bookstore cannot provide my content -- for no cost -- to thousands

I'm sorry, but I strongly disagree with you.  The problems are not 
amenable to technical solutions -- in the absence of the publisher.

The real problem with the Web and Mosaic and all the rest is that these 
are publishing "solutions" designed by technologists.

Go and tell a publisher that everything they have known about control and 
intellectual property is now wrong.

This is an old horse with me, as some of you will attest, but until the 
publisher can be brought into this loop, we will be developing a 
publishing architecture no one will use.

It's a lovely thought to imagine that what we build here will overtake 
the real world with brushfire swiftness and that everyone must bow to the 
egalitarian model of information distribution or be consumed.

Dream on.

Could you give some evidence? I thought hidden fields were a pretty
good idea? What are the pitfalls? Are they real technical issues,
or a result of *@#$#@$ broken implementations? What's wrong with
"overloaded paths"? (what are "overloaded paths"?)

I am completely lost. Why does it matter whether the ';' goes before
or after the '?' ? Is this a CGI-BIN interface issue? A broken client
issue? A broken server issue?

Just wondering -- do you specify a Expired header for that file,
indicating it expires daily? If so any cache that doesn't honour it is
broken.  If you don't, then what do you expect?

I know it isn't easy to do in most current server, but the facility
exists to circumvent that particular problem with caching.

Is that a statement of current (traditional, non-digital) practice or a wish?

In the 'real world' publishers would probably like to have this sort of absolute 
control, but they do not. Their distributors 'cache' stocks (bt arrangement with 
the publishers). The retailers cache stocks. They may carry old editions until 
they are sold. The second hand market does not give the publishers any control 
whatsoever over content (annotations, pages missing) presentation (brown paper 
covers, sellotape, stains, etc) timeliness (all edition back to the first) or 
distribution.

Not necessarily. Individual users saving useful pages to local disk gives a far 
worse problem, becuase then there is no mechanism whatever for updates. Proxy 
caching gives you expiry dates, last modify dates and so on. This is clearly an 
improvement on ad-hoc saving bu individual users.

> You can provide no guarantee that the versions that you present to your
> users are accurate or timely

Sigh. This comes up again and again.

Accurate: you could put an MD5 checksum on it, and/or a digital signature or 
SOAP. Again, in the absence of this you have no guarantee that individual users 
haven't modified files either, which could be shown to colleagues and so on.
By making local response times quicker, caches actively reduce the risk of such 
tampering.

Timely: use expires. Have the proxy do a conditional GET on your server (I 
though this was always done, but it seems some proxies only do this if the 
cached document has expired).

> Further, I have no idea of the number of
> consumers who view my content through your cache [...]

I accept that this _is_ a problem.

Particularly for sites which must for various reasons keep track of access, such 
as to justify funding, give evidence of an outreach programme, etc.

Once server to server communications become worked out, it would be nice if 
servers could indicate that the document they are serving is one on which access 
statistics are desired. True clients throw this information away. Proxy caches 
note requests for this file in an access log, and periodically (perhaps at a 
time interval suggested by the original server) forward the relevant extract of 
the access log back to the original server. Possibly by a means other than http; 
possibly through PUT. Either way, into an incoming area for later merging with 
data from the servers access log to produce whatever usage reports are required.

> Even assuming that you are acting in good faith [...]

Lastly, I think you need to distinguish between caching proxies such as the CERN 
one, implementing published algorithms, and a rogue mischeivous cache that 
someone could in principle write to mess up your files. Yes, in theory someone 
could write a proxy that ignores pragma: nocache, that never expires anything, 
and changes all occurences of raisch@internet.com to lilley@mcc.ac.uk. In 
principle, similarly, someone could write a browser that did similar devious 
manipulations, or write  network router box software that faked packets coming 
from your server...

> The copyright issue is the more difficult one.   In light of the previous

Perhaps you could examine how this issue is already handled in store and forward 
systems such as email, news, and all uucp-type networking. Intermediate stores 
are used there. Plus how many network buffers, bridge router boxes, repeaters, 
internal buffers in the browser software hold a complete or partial copy of this 
original work. As you say,

Certainly not me. Hope these thoughts are of some use.

AAAAAAAH! See what you've done, Mr. Raisch?? Another specification
issue that was wrestled to the ground long ago, all muddled up again.
You should know better.

The protocol HAS a time-to-live!

Everyone: right now: before you post another message to www-talk,

They're all online, reachable from:

If you don't like them, get them fixed!

<rant>

It's no wonder the WWW specs are so poorly maintained. You not only
have to design, write, and edit the dang thing, but because folks
don't actually read the specs (partly because they're out of date
because nobody wants to edit them...), you have to watch the
discussion to be sure that implmentors don't get the wrong idea and
implement something else, because we all know that the specs don't
really matter... the existing implementations are what really
matter...

AAAARGH! Do we really expect to build a large, complex, distributed
hypermedia system with such lack of diligence?!?!?

I don't care what technological muscle we throw at this problem.
It won't provide a solution.  The problem is not the design of the 
protocol or the servers.  It is the human component.

Dan accurately pointed out the the HENSA server is misconfigured.  But who
is responsible for providing the proper configuration?  And how can it be
tracked?  Looks like the only reason that O'Reilly found out that HENSA
was misconfigured was from a table in a limited distribution published
work. 

I suggest that the only reason that caching servers exist is to improve
network resource usage, and by doing so, improve the responsiveness of
retrievals.  This is for the benefit of the caching server's network usage
and against the best interests of the publisher. There is no incentive on
the cache manager's part to acceed to the wishes of the publisher.  How
many publisher's will state "All of our information is timely, so
don't cache any of it" simply as an expedient? 

Caching servers treat the symptom, not the illness.

Two things:

Is the finger URL really even needed, except for ease of use?  It
seems to me a 10 line perl CGI script would take care of it with a
calling of .  <a href = "http:/cgi-bin/finger?[name@university.edu]">

Copyrights and Caches
------------------------------


I would hold off getting all steamed up about the problem of
copyrights and caches simply becasue legally it untested water. I
would bet that any file that is so time sensitive, that it will print
a disclaimer absolving the creator from any problmes it might cause
and the time of creation.  It would then be up to the user, either to
start a new WWW browsing session or hit the "reload" button if using
Mosaic if they felt the data might be "old".

As I recall, Mosaic allows one to turn off caching (or set the buffer so
small that it is "off").

Until more sophiscated schemes of user and document authentication,
etc etc etc come out. I don't really think it is an issue.

With regard to the first point:

     -- With the pragma no-cache, the user's client software can force
	the cache to fetch the latest version.

     --	a client tool can look at the Date: line
	of the document to see when it was taken from the original server.  It turns
	out that cache servers don't modify that date.  (I wish that fortuitous
	circumstance were hardened into the http specification.)
	Anyway, with this ability, the user can determine whether a cached
	document is sufficiently recent.


With regard to the second point:

     -- There has been discussion of the copyright issue on the www-buyinfo
	list.

     -- It will be necessary to build trust into caches.  Publishers should
	publish onto to those caches which they trust.

     -- There is no good technical way to prevent copying once it reaches
	the hands of the consumer in unwrapped form.

     -- I've got some ideas (which you can find on the www-buyinfo archives)
	which I'm going to present to a gathering of intellectual property
	lawyers here in California to get their reactions.

  Do you have a right to know this? There was a lot of talk at the WWW
  conference in Geneva about a "Bill of Rights" for the information age.
  This is an interesting issue to add to the list.
  
In the sense that he has a right to be paid for each one, yes, he has a right

I just looked through the NCSA httpd source code and found
no way to specify an Expires: header for a file.  If this
was a CGI script, I know I could add one myself, but how
do I tell the server to send an Expires: header for an
ordinary HTML or GIF file?

I realize this is getting off track, but it'd be nice to
be able to specify HTTP headers for random files.  For the
Unix environment, perhaps file `foo.html' could have an
associated `foo.html.hdr' file that the HTTP server knows
to look for, and adds any headers found there (like Expires).  
This would also be a solution to the problem of moved files 
-- if I rename `foo.html' to `bar.html', then `foo.html.hdr' 
could contain `Location: bar.html' (is that right?), without
having to modify httpd's config file.

No.  A book store can only provide your content at to thousands of consumers

  I'm sorry, but I strongly disagree with you.  The problems are not 
  amenable to technical solutions -- in the absence of the publisher.
  
  The real problem with the Web and Mosaic and all the rest is that these 
  are publishing "solutions" designed by technologists.
  
  Go and tell a publisher that everything they have known about control and 
  intellectual property is now wrong.
  
I'm not talking about doing anything in the absence of publishers, nor am I 
talking about telling publishers that what they are doing is wrong.  On the 
contrary, what I'm saying is that electronic distribution requires middle men 
just as much as paper distribution does, and that we're creating problems 
where none exist because we call the middle men distributors for paper and 
caches for bits.

John Labovitz <johnl@ora.com> suggested that what he needs is an accounting of 
what the cache/distributor has done.  Providing that is technically quite 
feasible.  If you're charging for the materials than sending a bill is too, as 
is refusing to send materials to anyone you can't identify.  Yes, you can't 
guarantee that someone pretending to be an individual won't won't 
redisstribute your material, but a paper publisher can't guarantee that 
someone ordering a single copy of a book isn't a copy shop either.

In case it's not clear, I'm not claiming that all of this is in place with 
existing protocol definitions, only that they are problems we know, in 
principle, how to solve.  My concerns are that we not fall into the trap of 
not doing anything because our solutions aren't any better than what's already 
there, and because an electronic system without middle men won't work any 
better than a system where every book reader has to deal directly with the 
publisher would.

A possible usefull extension (yet another one)
is to have the page, and/or url contain another url to return
to the user in case some url fails (now we are forced to live
with message like .... bla bla server refused ...)

It would be nice if a document writer could replace the error message
with a page of his own design like

it could be placed inside the head
<error = http:.....>
or perhaps even differently for each link:
<http://normal.url/ err="http://alternative/to.be.used.when.first.failed">

simple elegant and very usefull.

  Analogies are like paper mache - you can make anything out of them.  I 
  don't think contrary arguments to Rob's post are served by comparing 
  caching servers to book stores. 

I didn't intend this as an analogy, but to suggest that, when Rob Raisch was 
being critical of caching servers because they _intrinsically_ are incapable 
of solving certain problems, he is asking them solve problems that paper 
publishing can't solve either.

  Book stores are still limited by stock
  on hand, and they always provide accountability for the number of items
  sold (discounting fraud). 

My claim was that a technical solution (caches identify themselves as such,  
provide an accounting of _their_ clients if asked, and respect expiration 
times) addresses the problem Rob raised.  I thought his concerns were about 
preventing fraud, and my point was that we shouldn't insist that electronic 
mechanisms be any _better_ at preventing fraud than paper publishing.

  Caching servers, on the other hand, provide no 
  such accountability on their own.  In fact, from the provider's 
  perspective accesses from caching servers are almost indistinguishable 
  from regular accesses (ignoring the fact that I can find them through the
  USER_AGENT CGI variable).  

I agree that the current protocol does not.  I beleive, though, the sorts of 
changes required are straightforward.  Rob believes (I think) that they are 
fundamentally impossible.
  
  We're not on the charge-for-access model either, and until secure 
  transaction protocols become standard we won't even think about it.
  Thus, given the choice between 
  
  1) a user not getting the page, or
  2) a user getting the page without our knowledge
  
  I'd choose the latter. 

I (being a reader rather than a publisher) would agree.  I also believe that 
refusing to use caches is equivalent to (1) because an electronic market with 
only point to point distribution will collapse under its own weight, just as a 
physical market would; some sort of hierarchical distribution mechanism is a 
necessity.

I'd choose the latter.  

Now, as to the problem of keeping info up-to-date: I disagree that it's 
in the user's or cache manager's interest to ignore Expires: headers, or
to purposefully provide out-of-date information.  If I was going through 
a cache and was relying upon up to date stock quotes or weather 
information for my job, any cache manager who that to me would probably 
see themselves out of a job pretty quick.  

Now, this doesn't mean I'm happy with the way caches work.  And like GNN and
Rob, I am definitely interested in how many people are looking at our pages. 
I've mentioned a couple of times in various forums that I'd be happy if the
caching server sent as a minimum a HEAD request for the object being
obtained, If its Last-Modified date were more recent that when the cache
grabbed it, it'd fetch the whole file (preferably doing this in one HTTP
connection), other wise it'd just serve the cached version.  I can count the
HEADs (removing the subsequest GETs for the same object from the same server)
as full accesses, thus satisfying my interest as a provider in how popular my
pages are, and I'm guaranteed that they are getting the most recent version
of whatever I put up.  If our server is overloaded or the link is ddown and
the HEAD request doesn't get through, then the cache should serve up its
local copy - this fulfills my wish that the user sees the page even without
my knowlege if the alternative is that it's unviewable. 

I'm really not interested in playing cat and mouse with people who
unwittingly put our stuff up for copying.  It's the people who wittingly do
it - running "Wired Areas" on BBS's, mirroring our site on a
public-access-unix system, etc - that we are willing to spend our time on
(both of which have happened).  The next logical step for online 
publishers, who see their site getting overloaded and whose distant 
customers experience a huge amount of lag, is to set up mirror sites 
as GNN has (we're looking into that, too).

This suggestion is not viable as a general solution, due to the  
limitations of HTML/SGML.  URLs are effectively limited to 1024  
characters by the HTML 2.0 DTD.  This just doesn't leave enough room  
for the state of many interesting applications.  Of course, field  
values are also limited in this way.  But you can have as many hidden  
fields as you like.

Hidden fields awkward?  I disagree.  It is very convenient to have  
all the state of the server program transported in exactly the same  
way, whether or not it happens to be directly manipulable by the user  
at that point in the interaction.  It's a flexible, general  
mechanism.

Well, great minds think alike! (Or as my mum would say, weak ones seldom

My suggestion would give you precisely the same level of detail, ie common log 
format entries, just lagged a little in the updates.

I refuse to use the HENSA cache for precisely that reason.Well, that and the 
need to edit URLS to meet their syntax. CERN proxy cacheing on the other hand, 
is a different matter - as well as being transparent to the user.

I agree that this is pathetic. But it is a consequence of using the HENSA cache 
(or indeed the Lagoon Cache) rather than caching in general.

There is nothing stopping you putting an expires date on each Dilbert gif so it 
lasts 24 hours. Proxy caches could (should) query your server, if reachable, to 
see if current.gif or whatever has changed since the cache copy.

Actually, I just tried this, using our nearest GNN server at Ireland Online. 
Doing a head on /gnn/arcade/comix/dilbert.html told me that the enclosing html 
file last changed on Saturday 09-Jul-94 - fair enough, its just trimmings, 
warning notices and icons that don't change. Doing a conditional GET on 
/gnn/arcade/comix/graphics/Dilbert.gif with the current date and time gave me a 
304 Not modified with a Last-Modified of Sunday, 21-Aug-94 03:59:00 GMT (but no 
Expires: header)

So all/most of the mechanisms are in place for a proxy cache to negotiate to 
serve the current Dilbert while keeping the GNN server lightly loaded.

Incidentally, how do ORA handle cach coherency among their various servers? What 
is the latency in propogating new files - ie, when the main server gets an 
updated file, how liong (in minutes, hours etc) before the sewrvers in Russia 
and Japan are serving the same information from the same relative path?

Thinking about what I just said (it happens sometimes ;-) ) _cache_coherency_. 
Of course. There is a whole existing literature on cache coherency from the 
whizzy computer world. (And me sitting just yards from a KSR64, which is 
essentially 64 processors with coherent caches pretending to be one global 
address space). So using that model, we have a multi-cache, multi-processor 
setup. Our caches are fully associative - no sets or lines to worry about. And 
in that set up, to guarantee that processor B sees the correct things from a 
particular memory location, it does not go round asking all the other processors 
if they are working there and have a more up to date value in their caches or in 
the registers. No, it is up to the originating processor to send out cache 
invalidation signals to the others.

Chew on this. Suppose proxy caches identify themselves to servers (there has to 
be a better way than user agent fields). When the originating server updates a 
document it sends out invalidating signals to the proxy caches that grabbed that 
document during its non-expired time. (Erm ... so if the document has an expiry 
of one week, the server need not tell a proxy that grabbed the document with 
that name two years ago).

The proxy caches invalidate the cache entry, and either procatively get the new 
version or more likely wait for the next hit to come in, depending how they are 
set up, whether they are clever enough to have analysed their own usage 
patterns, and so on.

Cascaded caches send out invalidation signals to the caches that accessed them, 
and so on.

Comments?

Well the original reason was to allow access to people behind firewalls, but 
that just showed the advantages of cacheing. So yes, it improves network usage 
and reduces long distance traffic, which is to the benefit of all of us. 
Publishers included.

> This is for the benefit of the caching server's network usage

Sure, among other things.

> and against the best interests of the publisher. 

Stating this often does not make it so. 

Assuming your hypothetical publisher actually want people to access some of 
their data - which is becoming unclear from your statements - then yes, there is 
theoretically the potential for out of date or even modified versions to be 
produced. This is nothing new. There is the potential for a bookstore to scan 
your books through a Xerox Docutech, mask out your logo and copyright details, 
print 'em by the boxload, and sell off cheap pirate copies to the third world.

Or, indeed, OCR your books and post them in installments to rec.slack via the 
anonymous mailer in Finland.

In general, however, this does not happen often enoug that existing methods of 
book distribution and sale are called into question.

Assuming then that some data is to be distributed, then making it accessible not 
just to academic sites but also to commercial sites (the ones with the money, 
and also the ones using proxies to get across their firewalls) is clearly in the 
publishers interests. 

Similarly, having a chain of proxy caches distribute your information to several 
million readers without several million readers all doing slow intercontinental 
accesses and giving your server the response time of an anaesthetised 
hippopotamus is in the publishers interests.

> There is no incentive on
> the cache manager's part to acceed to the wishes of the publisher. 

Could you advance some support of this notion, apart that is from what you have 
assumed? 

Setting up some sort of dichotomy between honest, quality assured publishers and 
nasty, rapacious networking folk who are only out to maliciously rip off and 
subvert your data is not, I feel, a good way forward.

> How
> many publisher's will state "All of our information is timely, so
> don't cache any of it" simply as an expedient? 

Unless they only have your postings to go on ;-) I suspect that the answer is 
'not many'. 

It is always difficult on these discussion lists to know in what order people 
have read messages and how often they check their mail; however I have seen 
several recent messages pointing out that caches can readily provide information 
of guaranteed timeliness. It may be that you have not read these yet. But if you 
have, please stop repeating that caches necessarily serve outdated information, 
as that statement is false.

> Caching servers treat the symptom, not the illness.

I remember someone saying that a paradox is a problem incorrectly stated. I 
suspect that the illness you are attempting to invoke, supposedly impervious to 
any form of technical solution, supposedly at the mercy of solutions arrived at 
without any input from publishers, falls under the same category.

I think you will agree that HTTP requires a reliable transport (ie dropped
packet recovery) and, whenever the requested object is more than modest size,
flow control.

Pushing these functions up into the network application layer (ie libwww)
seems inappropriate and asking for trouble.  Afterall, its all that TCP
really does.

Maybe the connection overhead concerns can be solved another way such
as with MGET, lookahead, smarter caching etc. ?

On the otherhand, it might be reasonable to implement HEAD with a datagram

You have to remember who the relevant parties in the communication are.
If I'm reading my mail, and somebody says

	"For more info about our product, finger info@widget.com"

and all I have is a WWW client, I can't exactly log in to widget.com,
start up an HTTP daemon, and install a CGI-bin script.

I can, however, do an "Open URL" or a goto, or whatever and say:

	gopher://widget.com:79/1info

I think some folks might like to be able to use something a little more
straighforward, e.g.:

	finger://widget.com/info

But it seems to me that if there were sufficient need for this, somebody
would have implemented it by now.

I believe in descriptive, not prescriptive specifications. Design by
committee is BAD.

  I suggest that the only reason that caching servers exist is to improve
  network resource usage, and by doing so, improve the responsiveness of
  retrievals.  This is for the benefit of the caching server's network usage

Well, no, actually.  The primary beneficiaries are the publishers service 
machine the network between the publisher and the cache, both of whom see an 
n-fold reduction in the workload they have to process.  Users of the cache see 
improved response only in the indirect sense that the publisher wouldn't be

would either be overloaded or unnecessarily expensive. 
 
  and against the best interests of the publisher. There is no incentive on
  the cache manager's part to acceed to the wishes of the publisher.

There are several possibilities I can think of:

1) honesty,
2) they would be breaking the law if they didn't,
3) publishers would refuse to let them cache their publications, upsetting the 
caches customers and possibly costing them money.

*Many* times I've gone looking for specs related to HTTP/HTML issues,
scouring CERN, NCSA, using any and all robots, only to come up short - a lot
of what's there is poorly maintained, out of date, irrelevant, or pipe dreams
that never saw their way to implementation.  Saying "it's in the hypermail
archive" isn't a help either, since short of reading a large chunk of the 
messages I don't have a way of finding the information I need.  Finally, 
hardly any of these docs contain a last-modifed date, so I have no idea 
how current they are.  This is one thing I'm hoping W3O will make a 
priority of fixing.

I think that this is a good idea.  It would be nice to see the error 
message as well, so that it would be possible to differentiate a server 
not found from a server timed out, for example.  Perhaps a composite of 
the error message and a document pointed to by the error url.

Yes. One of the things I have strived for in the HTML 2.0 effort is to
make it clear what's really out there and standard, and what's just
a proposal or an idea.

Now there's an opportunity where somebody could do a GREAT service to
the community: edit an archive of the www-* mailing lists: provide
fulltext searching, collect stuff by threads, generally organize it
for easy access. The existing archives are good, but the data has
exceeded heir navigation techniques (pick from a great big list) .

Aha! This is not the fault of the CERN folk. It's your fault, or the
fault of the developer of the client you use. My client tells me the
modification date of
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html,
along with other semi-handy info:

	Maybe it's just emotional and nobody likes them. 
My experience was more technical in that I found an unacceptable 
number of clients didn't (don't) support them.   I do,  though, 
have problems with the idea. 
 
	Look ... I'm all for giving any and all options to the 
user/publisher,  so I wouldn't dare suggest to do away with hidden 
fields.   Further,  hidden fields allow the contents to flow along 
the same path as the non-hidden fields regardless of the implementation. 
 
	But ... if what you want to do is pass along some (call it) 
"state information" (and there are other things too,  which aren't 
exactly state,  that fit  (see my example in previous note)), 
using hidden fields to do it is a hack.

	"overloaded paths" -- my term.   Loose definition follows. 
 
	My understanding was that  *all* (HTTP) servers parsed 
what follows the "?" as  "search arguments"  or other data, 
like form response.   Presuming this is correct,  then 
 
	    http://serverhost/my/script;somevar=foo?othervar=fum 
 
	binds  somevar=foo  to the script without it being 
part of the  "path".   So  somevar=foo  and  othervar=fum  get 
get sent to different parts of anyone's server.   I don't have to 
code something like 
 
	    pass /my/script/* /server/my/script 
 
	in the config file to pin all like-looking requests to 
the same script.   That's an implementation strain I don't want to 
put up with.   It's fine if someone has the tools to code such a feature 
into their server,  but it's not part of the spec and I don't think it 
should be presumed to be some feature of URL syntax. 
 
	Overloaded paths are where the slash is the only delimiter 
used in the "path" part  (the part (if any) before the question mark 
(if any)).   Allow another delimiter and you don't  HAVE TO have 
overloaded paths.   You CAN,  but you're not forced into it. 
I think people will usually prefer to NOT overload paths.

But, isn't that what (HTTP) Expires: is for?
If the information may change over time, then it should be marked so.

There are some documents that the provider know *WILL* be superceded,
although he doesn't know exactly when. It would seem that a reasonable
procedure would be to set Expires: to now + 1 unit, and that the client 
or caching server should use "If-Modified-Since:" to check if it 
has *actually* expired. ( Or does having no explicit Expires: imply 
this ?  Whichever, there should probably be a usage note somewhere to
document the proper procedure. )

I think both ends should have a compatible goal: to follow a common
protocol. Is the problem here: 
 (1) That a new feature/header-field needs to be added to the protocol. 
     ( i.e. is Expires: being forced to carry too much of a "semantic load"?)
 (2) That a usage clarification about how to properly USE the protocol
     needs to be added. ( Semantics of Expires: needs to be defined. )
 (3) That there are just some broken or misconfigured servers out there.  
? I have listed those in what I think are increasing probability, but
I would consider any of them more reasonable conclusions than that 
caching servers should be considered harmful.

 The data is likely to get "copied" numerous times in transit from the 
provider to the client. ( And probably cached on the client - and what 
if my client provides cross-session global caching ? ) 
 The only technological fix is for the copyrighted data to be encrypted
and viewable only by the authorized client/customer. ( i.e. cached and
encrypted data is useless for another client with a different key.
This could be an argument for (#1) above. Trying to overload too many
functions onto Expires may make erroneous results ambiguous. )

I would take this, and the implication of legal culpability on the part
of the server for copyright violation, as an argument for specifying
"reasonable behaviour" or semantics more strongly: to distinguish that
the server (and it's maintainer) can't be responsible for things that 
the client doesn't tell it! True - RFC's carry no legal weight in any
courts I know of, but specification in an internet standard, plus a 
couple of expert witnesses to testify on what the "community" considers
to be prudent behaviour might just make the difference in a court 
deciding on what exactly constitutes negligent behaviour.

I don't think the WWW is "ready for prime time" commercial use yet - 
better authentication, security, encryption, etc. needs to be 
standardized, implemented and deployed ( i.e. in *common* use )
first. But I think you are wrong in picking caching servers as the
scapegoat that would prevent it. I think, rather, that they are going
to be a useful and (practically) necessary piece of technology to 
bring the Web to the (commercial) masses.

[Sorry for the wide distribution, but the html-wg@oclc.org mailing
list has never really been announced -- this is supposed to be a
public review, so I don't want anybody to feel left out.]

OK... the stuff is available via FTP, in HTML, Frame, and Postscript.

Enclosed you will find:

	"August 22, 1994 Release Notes"
	$Id: README.html,v 1.1 1994/08/22 20:07:34 connolly Exp $
	ftp://halsoft.com/halsoft/olias/html-19940822/README.html

Here are the action items, as I recall:

	* Decide what format to keep "the truth" in.
		(if somebody can produce HTML and plaintext from Frame,
		I suggest frame. Otherwise, I suggest HTML. What a pain!)

		I spent way too much time on this. I never found anything
		I was happy with.

		Locally, the "truth" is a strange Frame/SGML mix.
		Everything but the tables are in SGML that gets converted
		back and forth to Frame for editing. The tables never get
		converted to SGML -- they're external editities. I had
		hoped to convert the "truth" to a more suitable DTD like
		the QWERTZ/LaTeX DTD or the Snafu DTD, but...

	* Document production: figure out how to make plain text,
		HTML, and postscript, suitable for submission as an RFC
		Volunteers: <lee@sq.com>, <timbl@info.cern.ch>

	* Frontmatter: about this document/status/etc.
		Voluteers: Larry Masinter <masinter@parc.xerox.com>

	* Character set sections:
		Volunteers: Murray Maloney <murray@sco.com>

	* Forms sections:
		Volunteers: Paul Burchard <burchard@horizon.gw.umn.edu>
			alanb@ncsa.uiuc.edu (Alan Braverman)

	* HTML/HTTP interaction section:
		Volunteers: Eric Sink <esink@spyglass.com>

	* Troll through the archives and find any other unresolved issues

	* General editorial review
		Voluteers: Peter Flynn -- HTML educator <pflynn@curia.ucc.ie>
			"Roy T. Fielding" <fielding@simplon.ICS.UCI.EDU>


I suggest we proceed with these action items roughly in order. First,
we have to figure out some of the document production issues so that
folks know what format to do their edits in.

Then, the editors proceed in series, thusly:

	* download the release
	* edit it to taste
	* produce postscript and HTML (and eventually text) for review
	* send mail to html-wg@oclc.org, announcing the anonymous FTP location
		of the new version
	* The WG reviews it, and either:
		* your edits are approved and the next editor starts
		* your edits are deemed incomplete and you get another try, or
		* your edits are rejected and the next editor starts from the
			previous version

I listed the volunteers as I remember them. I don't have good notes.
Do NOT assume the above listed volunteer has made a commitment based
on this notice alone. (i.e. don't assume that because I put a name
by an action item that we don't need anybody else's help)

I am soliciting new, public commitments of the following form:

	"I am Fred from WidgetCo. I can commit to an edit of the
	forms section, starting on or after Aug 30, to be released one
	week later. I require the frontmatter and document production issues
	to be resolved before I begin."

That is:
	* who are you?
	* what will you do?
	* when can you start?
	* when can you finish?
	* what do you need before you start?

DON'T send them to me. Send them to the WG at large. This is a public
document, a public working group, and a public commitment.

p.s. I aplogize for taking so long to release the document. I had hoped
to resolve the document production issues before releasing it, but that
turned out to be a bad idea. Had I known I was going to punt those issues,
I could have released it two weeks ago.


p.p.s. HELP! I can use all the help I can get on this, especially with
brining folks up to speed, as this group changes from a closed review
committee to an open working group, and lots more folks start getting
in on the game.

I get a lot of "can we add X to HTML?" mail, and as I have warned
folks that HTML 2.0 comments may be redistributed, I am just going to
forward such questions to the working group, with the understanding
that someone in the group will provide a much more patient and
thorough explanation than I would.


p.p.p.s. This group needs an acting chair for a month or two. TimBL is
busy. REALLY busy.  And I'd like to get some stuff wrapped up quickly,
but I'm in the middle of a product release here at HaL, and I can't
commit to drive this train to the station. Anyone? Please?

<p> At the July, 1994 Toronto IETF meeting, I presented a draft of the
HTML 2.0 specification in hopes that it would be considered for
submission as an internet RFC. The working group decided that the
document was not ready for publication -- that it needed significant
editorial, as well as minor technical, polishing.

<p> In spite of the fact that my resources for this project had been
exhausted, I agreed to coordinate the revisions. This was a
mistake. My resources for this project have <em>really</em> been
exhausted.

<p> I am releasing the HTML 2.0 materials, such as they are:

<ul>

<li> <a href="html-19940822-ps.gz">The postscript document,
     gzipped</a>. We're not quite sure this exactly matches the Frame
     version or the HTML version. The process of producing the PS and
     HTML is somewhat buggy and tedious.

<li> <a href="html-19940822-html.tar.gz">A gzip'd tar file of the
     document in HTML format</a>. Ironically, the HTML used here is
     not conforming to the document itself. It's generated by some
     tools that I didn't write. This is the same as <a
     href="http://www.hal.com/products/sw/olias/Build-html/CGQL0ZBEfmg24aK.html">
     the tree on the HaL HTTP server</a>.

<li> <a href="html-19940822-frame.tar.gz">The document as a FrameMaker
     book</a>. This is an intermediate product between an SGML editing
     system and the postscript output. It may, however, be the mose
     useful format for many purposes.

<li> <a href="html-19940822-sgml.tar.gz">The SGML representable portions
     of the specification</a>; that is, the DTD. This part is well tested.

</ul>

<h2>What's Left To Do?</h2>

<p> My notes on all this are very much scattered, but here's what comes
    to mind:

<ul>

<li> Rearrange the info/about/TOC/status sections

<li> Fix up the character set discussions

<li> Fix up the forms sections

<li> Remove references to NCSA image tutorials

<li> Add a section on HTML and HTTP interactions (inline images, forms, etc.)

<li> Fix the ISOlat1 declaration in the DTD

<li> Revise the terms/references section

</ul>


<h2>Background</h2>

It is incorrect! For those of you new to caching, if you haven't already
done so, please go and read the online information first, before making
more comments. Two relevant pages cover the Pragma: no-cache header
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proxies/ProtocolAdds.html> and
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html>. The
basic idea is to "force" the proxy or server on the other side to always
return the latest version of an item when the user does a reload. First
though, you should probably read the entire Proxy paper
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proxies/> and maybe reread the HTTP
protocol and CERN server documentation as well. If you've got technical
questions, Ari or myself should be able to answer them. Luckily this stuff
isn't too difficult and a lot of other folks on this list already
understand the technology and issues so they're also good resources.

Based on current usage, which is empirical not conclusive, most cache
administrators (it is the default setting if nothing else) at least check
for modified web documents via the If-modified-since header which is
relatively lightweight in terms of bandwidth, while still giving content
providers the benefit of seeing a document request. For content providers,
if you aren't running a server that supports If-modified-since then you're
wasting both your bandwidth and machine resources.

Servers that don't support even sending a Last-modified field to facilitate
efficient caching for their documents are just asking for abuse. I'll pick
on <http://www.wired.com/> since they appear to think it is important to
make all files available via server side includes just so a last modified
time shows up at the bottom of the document. Problem is this hoses the
caching algorithm. Some sites that I've checked with just configured their
NCSA servers incorrectly, and to be fair to WiReD they might just have a
configuration problem. I can outline what to look for and how to fix it if
you're having a configuration problem. To test for the problem, simply
telnet to the web server in question to get its home page or some other
typical document, if it doesn't return a Last-modified field that server
will most likely screw up your well intentioned caching for that site.

Caching is over 25 years old (unfortunately I don't have references handy
to the standard computer science books), the cat is out of the bag folks.
Web caching is not going to go away for the Web, in fact it is already in
most of the web browsers today on a per session sense, disk based
persistant caching like the CERN server does will most likely show up in
the next six months for the best Web clients.

Proper caching does not mean that content provider won't see hits. In the
case of corporations or other folks behind firewalls, it does mean that
only one or a few proxy servers will be making requests from the content
servers. It is always possible that some sites or even individual users
will decide to change their caching strategies in order to reduce bandwidth
loads (bandwidth isn't free you know) possibly by only fetching certain
items once a week. The important point is that it is up to them. If they
want to read the Sunday paper and only the Sundy paper all week, then
that's their business.

Content providers should be aware that users will use their content with
different frequency, possibly sharing (even without caching) and then build
that into their cost models. Their are valid points to discuss regarding
copyright and perhaps caching has just brought those issues to the
foreground sooner than expected. The content copyright - redundant copies,
etc. discussion should happen on some other list, not here!

Better might be to add a method that passes on statistics.  Eg,

CACHERECORD /ads/citycorp/index.html 52

meaning that 52 requests for /ads/citycorp/index.html were served from
the cache.

The biggest problem for me as a server administrator is that caches
hide accesses and popularity, and that's something that I *need* to
have, to justify the cost of the server.  I'd like to see that change.

i can't agree with this assertion. the benefits of caching are distributed
among users, sites, backbones, and the content server themselves.
the "publisher" of the ncsa home page would probably prefer that
large sites (read 10,000+ users) cached their page so that every user
loading up mosaic didn't have to hammer their server, their link,
their neighbors' link, etc. the publisher has the ability to limit the
duration this information can be cached, and should.  i assert that
caching servers which don't respect the ttl are broken.

a http-based stock ticker service probably doesn't want to be
cached while the market is open, but when it's closed, why not?
the ncsa home page could probably stand to be cached for
a reasonably long period, as could many of the information
"leaves" in organizations' webs.

there seems to be a number of issues here that people are trying
to collapse into one:

1. copyrights
2. timeliness of documents/cache consistancy
3. network resource utilization

the copyright issue will only be solved when authentication
protocols are offered, and even then, cannot be contained.
information piracy happens independent of the distribution
channel for almost all information digital or print. this is an
issue that's been present in the internet forever w/ ftp mirror
sites. authentication will discourage the legality of caching
in some scenerios, it will be important that the notion of
anonymous or guest be permitted to allow caching to
continue on public, cachable information like homepages

different web sites, and documents within the sites are going
to have different timeliness qualities. it's important for
caching servers to respect these, and i think that work can
be done to help educate administrators, and make it easier
for them to control policy. ultimately, the end users will fix
any problem that this incurs. if my site admin caches for 5
days for all information, and i'm trying to use the stock
service, i will let my admin know that their caching server
is not acceptable and the matter will be corrected by
the admin, the servers' author, or the user (by bringing
their business to another provider)

caching is a good thing for resource utilization, it lessens
the burden on your provider, on the internet itself, and
on the resource you're trying to connect to. overall, it's
win-win when the content is fair-to-be-cached. sounds like
the big issue that's been raised here is the definition of
what is fair-to-be-cached.

proposals on cleaning up this definition and the
mechanism driving cachability of documents, or are
people satisfied in the conventions to date?

ARDP v5 ([1], pp 36-41) is not suitable for use as a transport protocol for 
an http like protocol for several reasons.

	1. No window control. ARDP does not support receiver window management.
	   The receiver has no way to prevent buffer over-runs.

	2. No congestion control. ASRP does not use congestion control 
	   mechanisms such as Van Jacobson slow start. This is a real 
	   show-stopper; if a network becomes congested, and reliable
	   transport protocols without slow-start are used, the network
	   will experience congestion collapse.	[2]

	3. Vulnerable to packet duplication. ARDP does not provide any
	   support for detecting earlier incarnations of a connection using
	   a given connection id. This leads to a whole host of problems-
	   many of these are outlined in [3]. 

	4. ARDP does not support path MTU discovery. ARDP instead uses a 
	   fixed maximum size for datagram- for bulk transfer this either
	   leads to datagram fragmentation or an excess number of packets.

	5. ARDP does not estimate re-transmission delays. This leads to 
	   large throughput loss in the event of a dropped packet.


ARDP was not designed for use as a data transfer protocol - it was developed 
for use in a distributed directory service; in this application class, the 
expected transaction profile consists of a single packet request, followed by
a single packet response.

This is incorrect. See [4] and [3] for information. A TCP connection continues
to use resources for around four minutes after the connection has been closed.

The typical transaction pattern observed on a sample of one million
sunsite transactions shows that around two thirds of all user sessions
involve access to more than one non-gif object, where a session is
defined as a sequence of HTTP accesses from a single host with an
inter-query gap of not more than 4 minutes.

we try to keep stats on ftp.microsoft.com, but know that there are at
least 12 unofficial mirrors that deny this, or refuse to give us these
stats by matter of convention. technically, you can't enforce something
like this into the protocol, since it can be easily circumvented and
undetected. i assert it will be if such a mechanism is offered.

that's not to say that i disagree with the proposal, but that your "need"
will only be satisfied by disallowing the caching of documents and
forcing authentication for access. that's the closest you'll get to a
real count, but you'll never be able to find those that pirate your info.
sure, a caching server can ignore your request not-to-cache, but it
will hose the stock ticker service in the process, and likely will be
controlled by the users eventually.

Yep.  See <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/MOMspider/WWW94/meta.html>
for a discussion of these issues.  The servers do not support it yet,
but you could always hack a server to make it work.  Eventually,
someone will implement visible metainformation.

Been there, done that... you just described the If-Modified-Since
(a.k.a. Conditional GET) proposal that is already implemented on all
"good" servers, except that GET is used intead of HEAD.

It is already in the protocol spec (HTTP2) and the Proxy stuff that 
Kevin mentioned.  A full description (with history) is also provided at

    <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/caching.html>

which should have been referenced in Kevin and Ari's paper (hint hint).

The expiry mechanism can be relatively easily circumvented, but
nonetheless most of the time it isn't.  If the cache *by default*
passes back statistics to servers, then most of the time it will be
left to behave in that way.  You can't enforce *anything* with the
protocol :) but you if you make it possible, you take a step forward
from the current situation.

	Is this issue resolved in the law?  Is possession of an
	encrypted copy less of a violation of copyright law than 
	possession of unencrypted copy?  Would these servers even want
	to have a large amount of encrypted data that would be used
	by a relatively small number of users?  I think I have not
	been following this list long enough, as it seemed to me that
	the general www goal was to make the maximum amount of information
	available to the maximum number of people.  If that is the case
	is use of the system to distribute materials meant to have a 
	limited circulation even wise?  There will never be just ONE
	information network, in any event.

	It might; on the other hand, what difference does it make
	if the illegal copy was made on a computer instead of a xerox

If you want to see something really sad, tell a book designer that he 
can't specify the typefaces...

That said, In 99% of all academic publishing, a publisher adds no extra
value to a publication whatsoever. The extra value above and beyond the 
contents of work comes from the editorial board. Tell an editorial board that
they'll be able to distribute their work for free, and they don't need to pay
millions to the journal publishers, then see how unhappy they are (answer:
not much).

Not quite. The CERN server indeed implements a heuristic approach,
but a reasonable and configurable one. If a document comes along
without an Expires header but with a Last-Modified date, the cache
calculates an artifical expiry time. This is done by estimating the
document's age and adding 10%. For example, if a document has an
age of one month, it will expire after approx. three days. If it is
just one hour old, it will expire after six minutes. Thus, the more
frequently a document changes, the more frequently the cache will
check for a new version. You can also set an absolute upper limit
after which the server checks for a new version regardless of
expiry, you can modify the default of said 10% to some other
factor, and much more.

Dan already advised you to check the documentation. To put it
short: RTFM, folks! (That is, read the FINE manual!)

I couldn't persuade MacMosaic2A6 to do it - but it _is_ alpha :-) - and
it could have been my fault. I resorted to encoding the variables in the
PATH_INFO variable or making them selected radio buttons with only one
name/value pair.

I think this used to be the case. Lynx 2.3 seems to support type hidden fine
now. I know that this was not the case with earlier versions.

Subject: Security Re: Caching Servers Considered Harmful
content-length: 2221


On the caching servers question:

1) A vendor may serve information that has limited validity
2) A contract with a vendor may prohibit caching.

These issues have been considered in Shen :
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html

Issue (1) is a non issue. A vendor can and should put an expiry date on any
time limited information. Often however data is not time limited. This is
more true of commercially published information than non-commercial data. A
new edition of WiReD implies a new URL.

Issue (2) is harder. There is of course nothing that can be done to stop a
`bad guy' from copying data delivered to an arbitrary, uncertificated browser.
The vendor cannot know what lies at the other end of the line. Thus at root
we have an honour system backed up by enforcement proceedures (police action).

The Shen proposal includes a tag Prohibit: Which may be used to forbit the
caching, copying  or whatever of a document. This is orthogonal to any other
protection provided (eg encryption). As well as the cache problem there is
also the printing/saving problem. Why bother to complain about the cache
if a user can always save the page? Disabling of such facilities and of 
Windows cut'n paste should be mandated by a Prohibit: Copy tag. Printing
may be considered orthogonal, I may allow a user to print a single copy of
a document but not wish it to be saved on disk.

Outside the sales environment there are occasions where other security
concerns may require the distribution of a document to be traced. Where
classified information is dealt with there should be a security trail
to make identification of all persons with access to a document possible.


Security does not come from technology. It comes from robust systems of trust
which must encompass human factors. Any security system is only as strong as its 
weakest link.

On the issue of keeping the specs in sync with the code. We have an idea of how
to fix it. We have a tool that generates code from a specification. Retargetting
it at the HTTP specs should enable us to produce documentation that is in 
lockstep with the code. This is taking me a little time though...

I thought that was important enough to say twice, with a different subject, as

Hi

The CERN software (Server, Proxy and Line Mode Browser) alreay have
differentiated, hierarchical error messages. Code is also provided in
the Library of Common Code to have a link to a (multi-linguistic) page
where the error can be explained, but support in the server is not yet
implemented. It is expected to be done pretty soon.

Not sure about that. If I buy a book or a paper, am I allowed to let other 
people read bits? yes. Lend the whole of it to others? yes. Do these other 
people have to pay the publisher? No. Do I have to inform the publisher that on 
such and such a date joe borrowed my book for two hours and read chapters 2, 4 
and 7? No. Indeed, were I required to do so this would be a significant 
infringement of my personal freedom.

I do not see why merely publishing information digitally changes this 
established practice.

#ifdef UK_site
There was an interesting article in the Guardian on Monday pointing out that, in 
contrast to the US and most of Europe, in the UK we do not have a specific 
constitution or codified rights. Rather than specify what we may do, we have 
(supposedly) the freedom to do anything that is not specifically illegal. The 
present government is of course attempting to change this with the Criminal 
Injustice Bill. But I digress.

If a "Bill of Rights" for the information age were to be published, is there any 
existing mechanism whereby it could be made law, as we do not have specific 
written rights that could be added to?

In my experience (which includes maintaining copy-protection code back in 
the "floppy-disk days" of PCs), once data in is "user space" you have 
already lost the battle.  You can make it arbitrarily hard for people to 
copy the data; but if they can read the data in some fashion, it can be 
decoded to plain text.  The hardest cryptographic/coding technology to crack 
is the one-time pad, which raises the barrier considerably by using a 
different code for each message.  It is also such an awful pain to create 
and maintain one-time pads that they are only used for absolute top-level 
classified information (the "burn before reading" stuff).

To make a long story short (too late! :)), the only security that can really 
work is security in the OS, where it is assisted by the hardware.  If you 
can't read the data, it makes it very hard to decrypt/decode it...

	I am not an attorney, but lending it to someone
	for the purpose of making himself a copy is surely not
	permissible.  Putting things out so that people can
	copy it without its being know would seem also not to
	be permissible.

	I believe it is surely true that you cannot give your
	friend a COPY of the document you yourself legally own
	nor permit him to copy your original.

	It can change it if it makes abuse much easier, just as
	the existence of xerox machines did.

	Are you speaking of some international law, or specifically of UK?

	It would certainly be useful to have what rights we have as
	to information we want and information about us.  In US we
	have attempts through US law; is anyone promulgating an 
	international law that would go along with the international
	copyright/patent laws?  (I THINK there are international laws
	related to respect for copyrights and patents.)

	The problem is that these are basically legal questions.
	But if copyrighted information is to move through the
	system one either has to announce to the world that if people
	put copyrighted information out on the system they do so at
	their own risk, or, if one encourages it, one has to afford
	protection, and affording protection means in depth understanding
	of what a copy is, which may not be totally clear.  Again, I
	am not an attorney, but it would seem to me that one could
	argue that an encrypted copy is still a copy as it can be
	read as soon as one through a separate effort acquires the
	key.  If someone starts to distribute an encoded copy of,
	say, Sarah Paretsky's latest book, is that any more okay
	than if they started distributing xerox copies?  

	My suspicion is that it is simpler, at least at the beginning,
	that the first approach be given.  You might think of that
	as the 'shareware' approach.  

	Well, I have no idea how far off I am getting from the
	topics for discussion in this news list so let me stop here.

	It is, however, an extremely interesting topic.

	Is there a newsgroup which specfically talks about network
	design for the information age?

Timeliness can be managed via including information on when the information
expires and pointers to routes for obtaining asynchronous notification of
changes. The latter is something that can be handled separately from HTTP,
e.g. you could use email or a reliable multicast protocol.

The scaling issue will mean that publishers do indeed lose control of
where their information is being held in the net. The real problem is
ensuring that only people who have paid or are otherwise entitled can
actually read the information, no matter where it is held. This is a
challenge to the security folks and I can see a number of ways to handle this.

In the longer run we need to sort out a model for what kinds of meta info
are needed to describe objects, e.g.

    o   Can the object be held in a distributed cache with automatic
        replication (airline booking can't be done this way).

    o   Info describing how URN requests bind to objects, e.g. rules
        for binding depending on geopolitical cues, such as which
        country or organization the client belongs to. Binding may
        also depend on time, such as the latest issue of a magazine.

    o   Expected lifetime of the resource.

    o   How to hook/unhook into automated notification of changes
        and whether this is a requirement for holding copies.

    o   How to get authorization to view the object. This includes
        consideration of payment schemes.

    o   Publishing info such as author, date and organization

    o   Info for supporting searches for information, e.g. lists
        of keywords from a controlled vocabulary.

Given this kind of info, we can then get URNs and distributed caching
to work, something that will become increasingly important for
dependability as the Web continues to grow exponentially.

1.2  The page numbers in parentheses following citations of ISO 8879 
pertain to the annotated standard in Goldfarb's "The SGML Handbook".

1.3  Since it is assumed that NAMECASE GENERAL is YES on the SGML Declaration 
for the "htmlplus" DTD, case does not matter for element names, i.e., 
"htmlplus" and "HTMLPLUS" are the same element name.


2.   SPECIFIC

2.1  The statement:

     This DTD is parsed without errors by "sgmls -s -p htmlplus.dtd".

occurs in the SGML comment following the DOCTYPE declaration. When the 
"htmlplus" DTD was parsed with the "sgmls -s -p htmlplus.dtd" command
(using version 1.1 of the SGMLS parser), the error return

     sgmls: SGML error at htmlplus.dtd, line 483 in declaration parameter 4:
	    Content model is ambiguous

was provided. It is an error for an element of the DTD to have an ambiguous 
content model. See comment 2.3 below.

     It is highly recommended that the "htmlplus" DTD be parsed with 
the SGMLS command "sgmls htmlplus.dtd -egprsu -f err-log". The "-e" 
and "-g" options provide useful information with regard to the subjects 
of error returns/warnings.  Strictly speaking, specifying the "-p" option 
(parse the DTD only) implies the "-s" option (suppress output except 
for error returns/warnings). The "-r" option options warns of defaulted 
entity references. The "-u" option warns of elements used in the DTD 
but not declared. See Ref(2).

     When the "htmlplus" DTD was parsed with the SGMLS command
"sgmls htmlplus.dtd -egprsu -f err-log" (using version 1.1 of the SGMLS 
parser) the following error returns/warnings:

     sgmls: SGML error at htmlplus.dtd, line 483 in declaration 
	    parameter 4: Content model is ambiguous
     sgmls: Warning at htmlplus.dtd, line 574 at record end:
	    Element "RCDATA" used in DTD but not defined
     sgmls: Warning at htmlplus.dtd, line 574 at record end:
	    Element "EM" used in DTD but not defined
     sgmls: Warning at htmlplus.dtd, line 574 at record end:
	    Element "EMPTY" used in DTD but not defined
     sgmls: Warning at htmlplus.dtd, line 574 at record end:
	    Element "QUOTE" used in DTD but not defined
     sgmls: Warning at htmlplus.dtd, line 574 at record end:
	    Element "PCDATA" used in DTD but not defined

were provided in the "err-log" file. These error returns/warnings are 
discussed at length in the following comments.

2.2  The following classification of "SGML text types":

     Various classes of SGML text types:

       #CDATA   text which doesn't include markup or entity references

       #RCDATA  text with entity references but no markup

       #PCDATA  text occurring in a context in which markup and
		entity references may occur.

occurs in an SGML comment in the "htmlplus" DTD. While the three descriptions 
are correct, two of the three "classes" are incorrect.

       "CDATA" (character data) and "RCDATA" (replaceable character data)
are declared content, and neither the reserved name indicator "#" nor 
parentheses are used in conjunction with them. Accordingly, "#CDATA" 
and "#RCDATA" above are not syntactically correct. See clause 11.2.3 
"Declared Content" (page 409). On the other hand "#PCDATA" is a content 
token for parsed character data in content models. See clause 11.2.4 
"Content Model" (pages 409 to 413). Both declared content and parsed 
character data are used to define elements (though not in the same content 
model). See [116] in clause 11.2 "Element Declaration" (page 405).

       The following should be noted in passing. If the reserved name 
indicator "#" is omitted from the "#PCDATA" content token, "PCDATA" 
will be considered an element name. See the first NOTE in clause 11.2.4 
"Content Model" (page 411). Also if declared content of CDATA, RCDATA, 
or EMPTY is enclosed in parentheses in an element definition, it will 
be considered to be an element name. See lines 32 to 34 (page 412).

2.3  The "text" ENTITY declaration

     <!ENTITY % text "#PCDATA | A | ICON  | EMPH | EMBED | SP | BR">

and the "fig" ELEMENT declaration 

     <!ELEMENT FIG - - (EMBED?, FIGA*, (%text;)*)>

will result in a "fig" content model

     (EMBED?, FIGA*, (#PCDATA | A | ICON  | EMPH | EMBED | SP | BR)*)

which is ambiguous with regard to "embed" content. This means that a 
parser can not determine without looking ahead in the "fig" content 
(and perhaps not even then) whether "embed" content corresponds to the 
"embed?" token or to the "embed" option of "(%text;)*". Ambiguous content 
models are not allowed. See clause 11.2.4.3 "Ambiguous Content Model" 
(page 414 to 415).

     It is not clear how the "fig" element should be redefined to eliminate 
this problem.

2.4  The "em" element used to define the "title" element

     <!ELEMENT TITLE - - (#PCDATA | EM)+>

and the "h1" through "h6" elements

     <!ENTITY % heading  "H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6">

     <!ELEMENT (%heading;) - - (#PCDATA | EM)+>

has not been defined in an ELEMENT declaration. This is not a syntax 
error in and of itself (and in fact there may be a good reason for doing 
so at times). See lines 32 to 34 (page 412) and the following NOTE 
(page 413) in clause 11.2.4 "Content Model". However, in this case it 
would appear that a suitable definition of the "em" element is required.

2.5  The "quote" element used to define the "dd" element

     <!ELEMENT DD - O (P|QUOTE|UL|OL|%text;)+ -- definition text -- >

has not been defined in an ELEMENT declaration. As before, it would 
appear that a suitable definition of the "quote" element is required.

2.6  The definition of the "a" element

     <!ELEMENT A - - (PCDATA | ICON | EMPH | EMBED)*>

contains an undefined element "pcdata". In all likelihood, the reserved 
name indicator "#" was omitted from the content token "#PCDATA" for 
parsed character data.

2.7  The definition of the "embed" element

     <!ELEMENT EMBED - - (RCDATA)>

contains an undefined element "rcdata". In all likelihood, declared 
content of RCDATA is intended here. The parentheses around "RCDATA" 
must be removed.

2.8  The definitions of the "tb", "figa", "isindex", and "nextid" elements 

     <!ELEMENT TB - O (EMPTY) -- vertical break of 1/2 line spacing -->

     <!ELEMENT FIGA - O (EMPTY)>

     <!ELEMENT ISINDEX - O (EMPTY)>

     <!ELEMENT NEXTID - O (EMPTY)>

contain an undefined element "empty". In all likelihood, declared content 
of EMPTY is intended here. The parentheses around "EMPTY" must be removed.

2.10  There is a problem with mixed content arising from the use of the
"text" parameter entity.

      <!ENTITY % text "#PCDATA | A | ICON  | EMPH | EMBED | SP | BR">

Carriage returns and white space in the content of elements whose content 
models consist of certain combinations of subelements may be regarded 
as "data" instead of being ignored with the result that the element's
content will not parse against the element's content model. See the 
discussion of mixed content in the second NOTE in clause 11.2.4 "Content 
Model" (pages 411 to 412) and clause 7.6.1 "Record Boundaries" (pages 321
to 324). For a simple example of the problems arising from mixed content, 
consider the following content

      <item>  
      <emph b="b">DON'T DO THIS!</emph>
      </item>

of the "item" element

      <!ELEMENT ITEM - O (%text;)>

whose resolved content model is

      (#PCDATA | A | ICON  | EMPH | EMBED | SP | BR)

The carriage return following the "item" start-tag is not ignored; it 
is considered to be "data", i.e., parsed character data. The parser 
associates this data with the "#PCDATA" content token. The following 
"emph" content is rejected since the choice of parsed character data, 
"a" content, an "icon" tag, "emph" content, "embed" content, an"sp" 
tag, or a "br" tag may not be repeated. If the above choice could be 
repeated, i.e., if the above content model has an occurrence indicator 
of "*" or "+", there would be no problem.

      The "input" element

      <!ELEMENT INPUT - - (%text;)>

has the same mixed content problem. The following elements

      <!ELEMENT HTMLPLUS O O ((HEAD, BODY) | ((%setup;), (%main;)*))>

      <!ELEMENT TH - O ((%text;)+, TD*) -- a row of headers -->

      <!ELEMENT TR - O ((%text;)+, TD*) -- a row of data -->

      <!ELEMENT SELECT - - ((%text;)*, ITEM*)>

      <!ELEMENT FIG - - (EMBED?, FIGA*, (%text;)*)>

have similar but somewhat different mixed content problems.

      Unlike the "item" and "input" elements, it is not clear how these 
latter elements should be redefined to eliminate these problems.

I tweaked NCSA HTTPD 1.3 to support an "ErrorDocument" configuration
directive that maps error codes to virtual paths, e.g.

  ErrorDocument 404 /help/404.html

means that the document returned with a "Not Found" server response is
determined by "/help/404.html".  The HTTP response line is not affected.

Patches are attached for those interested.

Subject: Proposed SUBDOC support in HTML
Date: Tue, 23 Aug 94 14:56:58 CDT
From: Earl Hood <ehood@imagine.convex.com>
content-length: 1622


(I'm unsure what is the appropriate list for this message; any follow-ups
 to the appropriate mailling list).

Since there exist the a push for HTML to be SGML compliant, It might
nice if HTML supported the SUBDOC feature of SGML.  I believe SUBDOC
support will make it easier to maintain larger HTML documents with
muliple contributers.  Now I'm not sure about the implementation
impacts on servers and clients if SUBDOC was officially supported by
HTML.  I'm willing to here from others who are more experienced in such
matters.

On a related note, if SUBDOC support is too messy, or undesired, how
about allowing the HTML element to contain other HTML elements.  I.e.
An HTML document may contain multiple HTML documents (an ugly sentence,
but you get my point).  DocBook has such a declaration in its DTD.  It
might seem strange, but it does have its uses.

Or to be less drastic, the content rule for the HTML element could be
changed to the following:

	(((head,body)+),plaintext?)

This allows only a single HTML element, but one can have multiple
HEAD/BODY pairs in the document.

I believe this proposed content rule change would have little effect on
current WWW clients (and probably no effects on servers).  Because of
the current lack of enforcing structure by clients, one can already do
the above with clients (like Mosaic and Lynx).  The only problem is
that the clients cannot handle mulitple HEAD elements in the markup.
Currently, the clients will use only recognize the last HEAD element
defined.

Comments?  Or is what I'm proposing so !@#$*& idiotic, that it should
not be mentioned again.

I'd like to think some more about this matter, which is related
to the question of allowing a document type declaration; but for
the record,

> DocBook has such a declaration in its DTD.  It
might seem strange, but it does have its uses.

We did have a recursive DOCBOOK element in earlier versions, but
it is gone from version 2.1.  We realized that it didn't fit with
the Set/Book/Chapter model of the rest of the DTD.  It *did* have
its uses, though, and it may be appropriate for the HTML element
to be recursive; we just don't have it in Docbook any more.

Also, what are your expectations for browser behavior when a
compound document is accessed?  Must all the pieces be retrieved
and assembled before any is rendered?

Regards,

[Follow-ups redirected to www-html@info.cern.ch, the general HTML 
discussion list. We should also include the comp.text.sgml group
in this discussion somehow, as they're currently mulling over practical
applications of HyTime, ways to improve SGML, and ways to clean
up the design and enhance the features of HTML.]

I'm not sure what you mean by this. It's awkward, if not meaningless
to say "HTML supports X." You might say "it would be nice if HTML
browser supported SUBDOC by...".

It is, however, meaningfull to say "The HTML DTD and accompanying
SGML Declaration should allow SUBDOC," which they currently don't.

I agree. I'd like to arrange the "nodes" of my document in separate
document entities, serve them up separately as today, and parse
them all at once for printing etc. using SUBDOC.

I'd rather see other elements besides the HTML element allowed as the
document element, or "root" of an HTML document, e.g.:

	<DOCTYPE paper PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//3.0" [
	<!ENTITY ch1 SYSTEM "ch1.html">
	<!ENTITY ch2 SYSTEM "ch2.html">
	]>
	<paper>
	<title>Big Paper</title>

	<abstract>....</abstract>	
	
	<chapter content=ch1>
	<chapter content=ch2>
	</paper>

then in ch1.html
	
	<DOCTYPE chapter PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//3.0">
	<chapter>
	<title>Chapter 1</title>
	...
	</chapter>

and similarly for ch2.html


I'd like to see HTML 3.0 support the full range of LaTeX document
types -- paper, article, book, etc. plus perhaps RFC.	

Using a set of architectural forms to build the DTD would simplify
the design of browsers so that they wouldn't need explicit knowledge
of all the "semantic" tags like <abstract>, <author>, and stuff
like that.

But let's do capture the common communications idioms that are current
practice (outside of HTML...), and let's think about the distributed
computing aspects of shipping bits and pieces of documents over the
wire at different times as we design new DTDs.

I think we should look seriously at systems like QWERTZ and gf

	(see file://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/text/sgml/misc for gf source)

that capture LaTeXish idioms in SGML.

I guess I better go get the latest version.

That's a tough question, and I do not have the experience in 
server/browser development to give the best answer, but here is
a suggestion anyway:

    The client can retrieve each SUBDOC in a similiar manner
    as it does with inline-images.  If HTTP connection is
    terminated before all pieces are retrieved, then the client
    can render what it did get, and leave markers where the
    missing parts are located.

    In order for the client to properly retrieve the SUBDOC parts,
    the SUBDOC entity declarations will contain the URL to retrieve
    the SUBDOC.  For example:

	<!ENTITY part1 SYSTEM "http://www.org/part1.html" SUBDOC>

    I.e.  The SYSTEM identifier is the URL of the subdocument.  Of
    course, the URL can be relative to the base just as with anchors
    and images.  For example:

	<!ENTITY part1 SYSTEM "part1.html" SUBDOC>


    Unless I'm mistaken, this approach will require no extra work on
    the server's part.

Optimizations can be performed by requiring that subdocument entity
identifiers use the same base URL as the main document (this is next to
impossible to enforce), and the HTTP protocal can be modified to keep
an HTTP connection open for retrieving subdocuments instead of
opening/closing a connection for each subdocument.

I'm jumping the gun by replying to this today, but I can't think of a
better lead-in to the news that I was close to announcing... or a better
place to pre-announce it.

Your wish is mine, also, and now I'm in a place with the best tools in the
world to accomplish this.  As regular readers know, I've prototyped a
hypermail-like archive, with full-text search, at
<URL:http://asearch.mccmedia.com/>, which includes most if not all of the
www-* lists and other stuff.  No reflection on the author of MacHTTP, but I
didn't want to have the entire Web development community hitting my Quadra
605-based server over 28.8 phone lines, so I didn't publicize it very much.
 And it was a prototype, created with HyperCard, so it wasn't all that fast
on the back end.  And I was constantly playing with it, so it's had a
steady stream of new minor bugs.

As of last Monday, I've joined Verity Inc. to manage its World-Wide Web
products.  Verity is the world leader in information search and retrieval,
organization and distribution.  Last week I arranged for an upgrade of
Verity's net connection to a T-1.  In about three weeks, I estimate, we'll
be making available a server with the www-* lists, the Usenet
comp.infosystems hierarchy, as well as other information sources of
interest to Web developers.  There will be two overlapping subject
hierarchies; one that's publishing-oriented, a second that is
library-oriented.  The information will be presented much as it was on my
prototype -- hierarchical browsers, hypertext, indexes and of course,
full-text search and retrieval.

We also plan to support searches of "virtual libraries" of Web-related
documents that may reside anywhere on the Web, by creating a common index. 
You'll search here, but retrieve the documents from their home locations. 
Eventually I think we'll also offer abstracts of the indexed documents.

We're working on many other features, too.  And although I'm not ready to
talk about our specific products yet, I'll add that Verity is involved in
servers, spiders, navigational systems and browsers.

Verity is in the software tools business, not information content, so it's
our intention that this site will remain free to the Web community.  We are
already talking to publishers about taking over editorial responsibility
for our "virtual forums," as I call them, but we have a strong interest in
making sure that they remain free and highly useful.  As you've no doubt
figured out, we're using the upcoming site as a way to show off our
technology.

More information will follow as we firm up our rollout schedule.  If you've
tried out my prototype or used Hypermail or similar tools, please feel free
to e-mail me feedback on features that you'd like to see added.

I believe the entity declarations should be:

 	<!ENTITY ch1 SYSTEM "ch1.html" SUBDOC>
 	<!ENTITY ch2 SYSTEM "ch2.html" SUBDOC>

The SUBDOC keyword is important, because it tells the SGML validator (or
in this example, the Web client), that the entity defines a reference
to a complete document (i.e. contains its own DOCTYPE declaration).  This
distinction is important because the SUBDOC feature insures protection
from name spacing conflicts between the main document and the subdocument.

Testify, Brother Brian.  I'm writing a chapter on HTTP for a book on
the web, and I've had to resort to scruffling through code and
pretending to be clients and servers in order to find out what
*really* happens.

Case in point: the fact that redirection is done through the Location:
header line, not the URI: header line.  The `documentation' is little
more than a wishlist.

I don't think this is what I wanted. and it isn't as usefull eighter;
(I didn't look very good at your code, but I think that the server
 return help/404.html instead of the standard error message.

So this is all taken care of by the server and it is *not* described
by the document. I really want the brwoser to support it, and it seems
the only way, because the server may time out on a link, may not
be reachable, or whatever, and cannot handle the request at all.

Note that I don't want semi fixed html pages replacing the standard errors
I want flexible replacements as in
<a href="trythis.url" err="if.it.fails.use.this.url">
where the error url could be some friendly document I created, or could
be an alternative site , or whatever I like.

This way I can create context sensitive errormsg's in case something goes wrong

To be fair, I think the implementors were at fault here.  I recall
that URI: was in the documentation but Location: was used by accident.
Once that got into Mosaic and NCSA HTTPD, there was no stopping it.

From: Reed Wade <wade@cs.utk.edu>

After looking over the finger rfc again and assimilating 
comments I've made some changes to my original finger URL
proposal.


Reed Wade
---------
wade@cs.utk.edu -- http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/ReedWade.html



Finger URL



finger://hostname/[W/][username][hostlist]

hostlist ::= @hostname | @hostname{hostlist}


	finger://cs.utk.edu/@garlic
	finger://cs.utk.edu/W/wade@honk@garlic
	finger://cs.utk.edu/W/                   <-- these are different,
	finger://cs.utk.edu/W                    <-- here W is the username
	finger://cs.utk.edu/wade

Encoded CR's and LF's are not permitted in any part of the URL.

If the "W/" element is present then the finger request is preceded
by the /W (or /W<sp> as required) per rfc1128.



Returned Data Interpretation:

Existing finger servers return user information in unpredictable
ways. There are cases where it is not possible to get information
on only a single user. Interpreting returned data as plain text
is the only reasonable thing to do. Instead of attempting to wedge
more utility into finger, whois++ or http should be used.

On the lighter side:

22-Aug-94's Wall Street Journal reported that a Santa Cruz (CA, USA)
Pizza Hut is now taking pizza orders via the web.  One must have a
internet connection and have Mosaic according to the article.  I would
imagine that any browser supporting Forms and inlined graphics would
work.  Sorry no URL!

Just thought you'd find that interesting with all the talk about
caches and fingers and commericial applications.  Sorry to clog
your mailbox.

p.s.  If any one is really interested I could put up the whole article
(2-3 paragraphs).

Is it _really_ needed? No, but for a different reason. I wanted
this for end users who want to have pointers to finger servers.
Setting up more servers (finger gateways) is anti-scalable and
doubles the load on the net. I'd much prefer the gopher hack to 
that.

But yes, ease of use is the only actual reason for it.

I'm not opposed to gateways (especially as transitional tools). 
I worry about depending on them. Load doubling is a worst case
situation.

yes, that's an interesting typo

I very nearly posted it to the uri list originally but thought it ought 
to be hashed around here first. I'll post it there in the next day or
so if nobody has serious problems with it as it is now.

Of course, I'd like to think that finger gateways like ours actually

The proposed spec looks OK by me; I'd just have two comments...

- I think you mean RFC 1288, not 1128.
- This probably should go through the URI WG (not to start any religious
  wars, but it would be best of the two different incarnations of URLs
  did not drift any further apart.)

Reed, don't be so modest.....

The same argument could be applied to any non-http URL - why not a CGI for
everything; and then, necessarily, an httpd gateway in every pot ?

There are, and will always be, many people that don't have httpd's, gopherd's,
etc just waiting to be customized for their needs.  Thus, while the
server-side solution is elegant, it is not always even an option.

This thinking will either force all clients to embody a proxying httpd, or
for there to be proliferated, fully-functional, public httpd's; neither
of which seems likely, or even desirable.

Marc and I did nothing but follow the spec when we used Location:
instead of URI. We were using this HTTP "specification" which was
dated as expiring on 14 Jan 1994, and was released on 14 July
1993. This specification had not expired at the time.

This specification clearly states:

...

The response contains one of more header lines of the form

Location: <url> String CrLf

Which specify alternative addresses for the object in question. 

...

No mention is made of URI *at all*.

However, when the specification dated 5 November 1993 came out *after
we had implemented the previous one*, Location had been completely
removed, and it had been replaced by URI. Despite numerous attempts to
get someone from CERN to put Location back in at least as a
depreciated form of URI, the specification still has no mention of
Location.

And so we see that no good deed goes unpunished.

Being an author of a mail -> HTML archiver (mail2html), I'm interested
on what is specifically met by "collect stuff by threads".  Thread
detection is not perfect, and relies heavily upon people's mailers to
include the message ids of replied-to mail.  I'd like to get your (or
others) ideas on how one would organize mail exclusively by threads.
Technically, there can be threads that are impossible to detect due to
the lack of mailers inserting replied-to mail message ids (using
"Re:..." subjects for mail thread detection has major drawbacks and
problems).

Currently, it is easy to combine your own search capabilites (like
WAIS) with my program (you can automatically add a form into the index
page that interfaces to a search engine).  It does thread detection,
but does not generate a special list just for mail threads.  Threads
are shown via follow-up/reference links in the individual mail
messages.  I find it troublesome to come up with a listing format for
mail threads that works well.

I believe if one combines a decent search index for the HTML mail
archive(s), and individual messages always contains links to
follow-up/referenced messages, then having a special "mail thread"
master list is unnecessary.  Once you find a message of interest, you
can easily follow the thread through the follow-up/referenced messages
links.

Not true. A CGI gateway on one host does not give all clients access
to all finger servers in a scalable fashion. (Not to mention
firewalls, etc.)

The gopher: hack does. The gopher protocol is a complete superset
of the finger protocol. (well... I haven't researched it carefully,
but the common "finger foo@bar" is expressible as a gopher URL).

It's not the case that you can "tunnel" other protocols like this.

     You don't even need inlined graphics, though without them you won't see
pictures of the pizzas.  This was announced & first demonstrated Monday at SCO
Forum (taking place this week at UC Santa Cruz).  Came home from Forum to find
Pizza Hut boxes lying about, housemates having already tried it :)

I was *not* suggesting that CGI and proliferated httpd's was a reasonable
solution.  In fact, just the contrary.  It was a tongue-in-cheek proposal.

I couldn't tell from your response whether you're in favor of a finger
scheme or not.  So, if we're in raging agreement, sorry, but lest there
are still non-believers.....

It is possible to extend gopher functionality to support other protocols,
just like it was for CSO.  You can make gopher send just about any command
stream to any port (as long as you don't want/need ftp-like negotiation).

There are two problems with this (including existing CSO support in my
opinion):

1. How to support other command features of the protocol that gopher's
simple command output can't handle ?

2. How to add intelligent support for the returned "document" type ?  An
unmodified gopher client can (at best) interpret the reply data stream as
"text/plain".  Whereas an intelligent multi-protocol-browser would intuit
(from the scheme in this case) the data stream content and be able to
intelligently format (perhaps to HTML, or not) for display.

In my mind, the purpose of a new scheme is to both A) provide a potentially
rich command set for that protocol (ie not just live with gopher capability),
and/or B) provide an intelligent means for interpreting the results.  Either
need/purpose is sufficient cause for a new scheme.

In today's, multi-protocol-capable browsers, it is not *necessary* to
extend gopher to new protocols.  The fact that it was done in the past,
and the fact it *could* be done in some limited way again does not
seem to justify exclusion of a new scheme.

Long live finger.

I think it's time to thing about bringing HTTP some cocoa and putting it to 
bed. I've argued before that HTTP has severe enough problems in its basic
design model to make it unsuitable as a basis for serious future development-
it might be better to just document the protocol as it's actually implemented
(using the usual criteria of two independent implementations) and documenting
that much simpler protocol as the real HTTP. 

>And so we see that no good deed goes unpunished.

Yeah, but at least you got rewarded for all the bad ones :-)

It would have been faster if they'd used FedEx.  }:-)

BTW, I actually heard CBS radio news try to spell out the URL.  They forgot
to say the second slash after the "http:".  The SF Examiner had the same
error online on their WWW server but they corrected it when I pointed it out
to them.  BTW, I first heard about it from CNN.

It really looks like the media went hog wild over this one.  I've never heard
or seen a URL on mass media before!

If this is a good idea, to extend the syntax associated with HREF, that is.
Then the most generic approach would be to let the HREF-attribute be the
first choice and then let HREF2, HREF3 and so on be the subsequent choices if
the first failed. Wouldn't it?

A possible approach to select further alternatives if the value of HREF is
unreachable is to let any attribute of the form /HREF[0-9]+/ be used later.
Preferably in numerical sorted order.

An important question is when these alternatives should be used. After a 
timeout? After a timeout and certain status-codes? If the accessed data is
unusable in some sense?

Furthermore, is it at all allowed in SGML to have "generic" attributes like
this?

Nothing but questions but maybe some of them is good for the discussion.

One of the characteristics I like about the Internet is that it acts as a 
marketplace of information -- good/useful information gets promulgated, 
bad/useless information dies off.  Someone who persists in maintaining 
caching policies on their WWW server that ensures that out-of-date 
information is the only information on that server :) will be ostracized by 
the Internet community, shunned by their house pets, etc.

There exists a balance between having the most up-to-date information and 
spending the least amount of money for that information.  The balance cannot 
be tilted too far one way or the other without people reacting to it -- the 
creation of caching servers in the case of spending the least money, and the 
general ostracizing/ignoring/shunning etc. of Internet resources that are 
woefully out of date.

<soapbox>
Markets (including markets of ideas/information) are not perfect, but 
because of the sheer number of equations required to analyze a market, they 
work better than any centralized scheme (Weinberg's "Law of Medium 
Numbers").

Another interesting point - style guides for newspapers (and possibly other 
media as well) are fairly dated when it comes to computer technology, 
acronyms, etc.  I saw the article via an electronic newsfeed so I cut and 
paste the URL into Mosaic.  The problem was they had used double quotes to 
set off the URL from the surrounding text:

    "http:/www.pizzahut.com."

Aside from the one slash error you mention above, the usual style 
guidelines require them to put the trailing period inside the quotes - 
because those guidelines think it's a "quote" rather than literal text.

I've argued with editors for years over such things to no avail...

Subject: Bug in <BASE ..> or in relative URL's? RFC for CGI-specification
content-length: 2560

Hi (developers),

I've written a CGI-script which responds to a request showing the client
where to find files at it's local side, (because you need a server for
executing local scripts...).

Suppose you invoke a client with a local file in your current working 
directory eg. (/home/my/current/dir $ Mosaic form.html &)
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
               snapshot of my shell

The <HEAD>-information (in script's output) should be like 
  <BASE HREF="file://localhost/./"> 
which SHOULD work as expected: ie. saying "The prefix of all following 
relative URL's is at your local side in your current 
directory (independantly from where you are), so all following (relative) 
URL's correspond to subdirs of your current dir!"

But when the client gets the answer of its request the current directory
HAS TO BE EXPANDED (in the <HEAD>-statement) to something like 
  <BASE HREF="file://localhost/here/must/be/your/ABSOLUTE/path/">
or regarding to the above:
  <BASE HREF="file://localhost/home/my/current/dir/">
to work as it should be: The client can find the file
  <IMG SRC="PicDir/Picturegif">
physically under (/home/my/current/dir/PicDir/Picture.gif), but of course
the short "./PicDir.gif" could be enough information to find it.

The problem (BUG?) is that the server can't know the absolute (prefix) path
at client's side and time of sending, because this can be mounted at 
different places, on different drives or file systems. 

I think that should be no problem because the CGI-script is only able to
answer very special requests and ASSUMES that THERE EXISTS a subdir at client's
side which matches the posted RELATIVE URL.

There seems to be no CGI-environment-variable (wrong terminology, I know!?) 
like
  CLIENTS_CURRENT_WORKING_DIR = /home/my/current/dir/PicDir/
which could be evaluated at server side so my only possible solution 
(emulation!) is to create an extra input field in the form, in which the 
user has to specify it's current working directory ABSOLUTELY (VERY
UGLY and maybe unknown: Does EVERYBODY really know it's (maybe transparent)
"mount-point" when always using synonyms like "~fmajewsk/....."?)

Why is it not possible to check for "file://localhost/./" and supposing
NOT to start at root (with the absolute path) but at your current dir? (This
is only relevant using "file://"-(pseudo)protocol so this is not a 
security question: if you use "http://" all is done by the 
server, isn't it?)

Is it dangerous when a server knows where a client actually "is"?

Any comments?

The human beings are not on vacation any more.  They do have a large
queue for personal service, though, so obviously it helps to use
the listserv for anything you can.  The main problem is being
able to subsubscribe from a different address than the one
you were subscribed from.  Arthur is putting together a way of
doing that automatically.

As far as I know, the listserv distribution, basic subscription
control and document distribution is working.  If you find it is
"broken" in some way, then it helps to forward what it was you asked for and
what you get back.

We'll get more staff on this when funding comes through!

Well, not every OS works "current directory" like UNIX does.  MS-Windows, 
for example, has a current directory for *each* mounted file system, and 
this is shared amongst all the processes. If one process changes the 
"current directory" on drive C, all processes see that change.

So... which current directory should file://localhost/./ reference there?

Remember, HTTP is not just UNIX.  -- Darren

Since I live in Santa Cruz, this is relevant to my daily routine
(although I tend to order my pizza from another place)...

Feedback from a potential user was that their forms (actually, the
programs that digest the results of the forms) are a bit finicky about
things like commas in addresses.  Also, you need to be in their
address database (his street apparently was not.)

However, news is that at least someone ordered sucessfully but delivery
was to the wrong address.

(One of the local newspapers, the San Jose Mercury News announced that
it is coming onto the web in a few months.)

Well, I think the base of MS-Windows IS MSDOS and the MSDOS-file system 
recognizes the '.' as your actual (current working) directory. So sorry,
but I don't understand what the problem is. 
I wrote that Mosaic has been invoked from some current directory with
a LOCAL file, which is surely placed on a "mounted file system". And
I think, the client could easily get the information where it has been
invoked (by analyzing an (internal?) environment variable) and storing this
in a temporarily internal variable.
 
> So... which current directory should file://localhost/./ reference there?
Just where you started, see above.

            ^ Of course, but I wrote too that this all is only related to 
  "file://"-(pseudo)-protocol, which has nothing to do with HTTP.

  Am I wrong?

(This kind of stuff tends to be discussed on the www-speed list.)

That might help a little bit, but it means putting timers and
retransmit logic in the client.

But my observations indicate that transfer delay and rate are governed
quite a bit more by TCP connection time and the progression through
its slow start algorithms.

FYI...

Just a data point -- two DEC Alpha boxes (i.e. relatively fast
engines), one with a the NCSA server and the other with mosaic.  They
each have short, direct 155Mbit paths to a dedicated ATM switch.

In other words, this setup has significant CPU and bandwith resources.

And the time to fetch documents wasn't significantly faster than on an
Ethernet.

Hi.

We need some sort of "Compliance Test".  Every client produced should be
able to be "certified" compliant with a particular level of HTTP and HTML
support.  Either that or a big list of un-compliant clients should be
regularly posted to try to shake the authors up a bit.  The Compliance level
should be sent from the client along with the standard User-Agent field. 

 "Hi, I'm XYZZYBrowser version 2.2, I can handle forms as long as they are
 not Posted to authenticated areas and I use the file extension instead of
 the mime type for working out inline images apart from that I'm compliant
 with HTTP X.Y and HTML Z.X"

Why?  Well I can't seem to find many browsers that actually do
everything correctly!

With all the talk recently on this list about "Expires:" HTTP headers its
interesting to see if any of the clients actually make use of this
information...

 I've got a page which is constantly updated with a "refresh page" link,
 to stop the page getting cached it outputs an Expires header correctly.
 The majority of clients that visit me are- [1]

	lynx 2.3 beta (and below) ignored expires header
	WinMosaic 2.0 (alpha 2-6) ignored expires header
	AirMosaic 2.5 Beta C Demo ignored expires header
	Cello (0.9,1.0)           ignored expires header
	WinWeb a2                 ignored expires header
	XMosaic 2.2,2.4           doesn't cache documents anyway

So much for the expires header!  (Temporary solution: put a random query
string onto the link URL each time its run)

Take POSTing a form into an Authenticated area - which can handle it and
which cant? [2]

	lynx 2.3 beta             yes!
	XMosaic 2.4               yes!
	MacMosaic 2.0.0 a2 	  yes!
	WinMosaic 2.0 (alpha 6)   crashes (blank line in mime header)
	AirMosaic 2.5 Beta C Demo just been fixed (not on release version)
	Cello (1.0)               no authentication support
	WinWeb a2                 no authentication support

My application relies on the ability to post in an authenticated area,
how does my server know if the client they are using can or can't handle
it?  Maybe they could look at "User-Agent".....

You might think that clients would at least get "User-Agent" right, 
its amazing how many dont...

	According to the specification 

 	The first white space delimited  
	word must be the software product name

        <field>   =   User-Agent: <product>+
        <product> =   <word> [/<version>]
        <version> =   <word>

	FAIL - NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System/2.4 [=white space]
	FAIL - MacMosaicB6  libwww2.09 [=version in product name]
	FAIL - MacMosaic 2.0.0 a2 [=white space, no /]
	FAIL - OmniWeb/OmniWeb 0.7.4.1  libwww/unknown [=white space]
	FAIL - MacWeb/libwww/2.13  libwww/unknown [=too many /]
	FAIL - WinMosaic/Version 2.0 (ALPHA 3)  [=white space]
	FAIL - Lynx/2.3 BETA  libwww/2.14 [=Beta not part of version]
	PASS - AIR_Mosaic(16bit)/v3.00.02.02 
	PASS - EI*Net/0.1  libwww/0.1
	PASS - LII-Cello/0.9

You could argue that the User-Agent field isn't very important.  But
so many clients are not fully-compliant with the standards - it's
useful to be able to tell a user of an interactive service if their
client will work at all.   How?  The only way is for me to have
a huge table of clients with reasons for them not being able to 
handle the service

How about returning a GIF on STDOUT from a CGI script - all the clients
work apart from WinMosaic and AirMosaic which don't bother with the
mime-type for determining what to do with a file - they still use the
file extension!

---

1.  I know some of the clients I mention below are in Alpha or Beta
test.  A large proportion of clients visiting my site are
labelled as "alphas" and "betas", people will continue to use them
for some time. 

2.  Some of the problems are due to bugs in the clients and 
I'm not blaming either the protocol writers or the browser
authors; we need a way of the server knowing!

	Good point.   But I like Jay's idea.   Let me suggest that 
the server providing "help" files be available for clients that don't 
have as much savvy.   I agree that the help files should be local, 
not only for the  server-failure  case you cite,  but also because 
I don't personally want to have to supply a plethora of languages 
from my server.   Let the client handle 9-out-of-10 cases. 
 
	Servers,  though,  might still serve out help files. 
I was going to suggest  /htlib  instead of  /help.   Not sure where 
everyone is putting their GIFs.   Some,  I'm sure,  are just hoping 
that the client is Mosaic with it's built-ins.   So ... /htlib would 
be a repository of,  not only help files and error messages,  but also 
icons for in-lines for HTML that the server generates on-the-fly.

The problem is that there is no one current working directory. There's a 
current working directory for A:, one for B:, one for C:, and so on.

Also, these "current directories" change as the user manipulates other 
programs. There isn't one "current directory" per process. There's just 
one per disk.


> > So... which current directory should file://localhost/./ reference there?
> Just where you started, see above.

Ah. Then you mean that file://localhost/./ should refer to the directory 
that the HTML client (Mosaic in your example) came from.

Let's say my current directories are A:\one and C:\two and Mosaic is in 
C:\bin and C:\bin is in my path. My current drive is A: when I invoke 
Mosaic with file://localhost/./    What should it look for? 

That is the problem I'm referring to.

Well, HTTP runs on more than UNIX, as does Mosaic and other HTML-based 
clients, is what I meant. file://... does indeed have something to do 
with HTTP, since you want your server returning that over HTTP to a 
client, yes?  Wasn't that your whole point?

Let's take this offline if we continue. It's getting kind of silly, and I 
think the point is made.

Absolutely. But until there is a rigid standard it is difficult to
comply with it. When the standards arrive I'm sure companies will
start quoting compliance, which one can test.

That's a complete waste of bytes, IMHO. One can use the User-agent
string to index a list describing compliance; there is no point
sending it with every request. Besides, there is no way to add
to the User-agent once it's fielded, so how usful would it be
when new bugs are found?

You want to build knowledge of every protocol bug in a client
into the server? I certainly don't... 

3. We need a way for users to know which client to choose to
depending on independent conformance testing.

This is true - the client authors are not going know what bugs their

This table I have to have in all my CGI programs is going to
get huge.   I suppose I could have a "I don't know your client,
please click here if you were able to do the following..." but
its getting silly.  I've been trying to explain to other staff
in my department that although our application runs on any
platform which has a WWW browser, actually you can't run it
with the browser you just downloaded cause it has a bug - and
not that one as it doesn't authenticate.  How are non-WWW
experts to know the difference between browsers?

the table they will be motivated to improve!

Which does imply that we have standards that everyone adheres too - the
Location/URI http header stuff is all to common.   Is this a function
of the new W3O?   Sounds like an ideal organisation to test
compliancy and make sure all the standards are fixed.   After all, a
browser that says "Tested complient to HTML4, HTTP3 by W3O" is going
to have a market advantage over ones that don't.

Eventually, perhaps yes.

But I personally prefer the Linux development model: a motivated
individual senses a need, and takes the initiative. If thier specialty
is technical, they write the code. If they're effective communicators,
the write doc. If they're good organizers, they coordinate the effort.

The WWW is much the same. Folks that see a need march forward and fill
it.

Your choice is to wait until commercial entities fill the void. If you
wait for that, you deserve what you get. :-{

Building this information infrastructure is a huge project. I suspect
W3O will have its hands full just coordinating things. Progress and
functionality enhancements will remain the responsibility of the community
at large for some time to come.

A quick peek at a HEAD request to the PizzaNet server tells us:

They are running NCSA HTTPd 1.1 - no wonder responses are slow: it parses

yes, the gopher hack is functionally equivalent to plain
finger. (The end of line char(s) might be different but there's
no missing functionality.)

I shouldn't bring this up because I think it's a lousy idea but
you could always have a generic tcp url that encoded all the 
interactions required for an arbitrary protocol.  It'd probably get 
kinda long tho...

[ ...excellent summary deleted... ] - Thanks! 

Someone else who has thought about distributed agents from a different
language perspective is Luca Cardelli at Digital SRC, who has developed
a object-oriented language for distributed applications: Oblique. 
<http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/Obliq/Obliq.html>

[quoting from his paper at that site:] 

| The guiding principle that separates Obliq from other distributed
| procedural languages is the adherence to lexical scoping in a
| distributed higher-order context.  This principle is conceptually
| simple and has a number of interesting consequences: it supports a
| natural and consistent semantics of distributed computation, and it
| enables elegant techniques for distributed programming.

 [ ... ]

| Lexical scoping has many interesting implications in a distributed
| context. One is that, together with strong run-time typing and
| interpreted execution, it can provide network security guarantees.
| Consider the situation of a server executing incoming foreign agents.
| Because of lexical scoping, these agents have access only to the data
| and resources that they can reference via free variables or that they
| explicitly receive in the form of procedure parameters. In particular,
| foreign agents cannot access data or resources at the server site that
| are not explicitly given to them.  For example, operations on files in
| Obliq require file system handles that are available as global
| lexically bound identifiers at each site. A foreign agent can operate
| on the file system handle of its originating site, simply by referring
| to it as a free identifier. But the file system handle at the server
| site is outside its lexical scope, and hence unobtainable except with
| the cooperation of the server. Degrees of file protection can be
| represented by file system handles with special access rights. 


 Nathaniel Borenstein has also thought about this from the perspective 
of emabled mail applications and safe-tcl:

[ from the tcl-faq: ]

| 63. The following are a series of references to papers 
| relating to the Safe TCL package.
| ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/nsb/st/safe-tcl.ps
| ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/nsb/st/safe-tcl.txt
| ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/nsb/st/em-model.txt

  However, I'm not convinced that the safe-tcl method would work well
for other, more general types of agents. ( I haven't studied it in 
depth, but there does seem to be too much dependence on pop up 
warning dialogs, etc., but maybe that's not as essential to the core 
facility as it looks. ) 

  Even if safe-tcl were a completely acceptable general solution, there
is still reason to consider ways to add safe distributed agent
capability to other languages: This topic came up on the python mailing
list, not primarily as an effort to duplicate the functionality of 
safe-tcl, but to allow distributed and cooperative programming and 
eliminate the need for central management of a program/module library. 

  Perhaps COBRA/OMG/DSOM/IDL is the way to provide these capabilities
in a language neutral manner. I don't know - I haven't had time to 
read up on the protocols in detail. I don't get the impression that
they SOLVE any of these problems, but perhaps they provide another
framework. 

  I have also seen this topic come up on www-talk, and other WWW 
related lists: there is interest in allowing servers to send code
to be executed on the client side, as well as providing more general
programmable agents on the server side. The WWW protocols also seem 
to be headed towards trying to provide the same sort of functionality 
as OpenDoc promises. 

  From the cross posting in the newsgroups line, you can probably guess
I'm trolling for more examples & citations. ( Maybe we need a new group
to discuss programming systems for safe distributed agents ? ) 

 Of course, what is particularly unique in the Telescript seems to be that
negotiation of the cost of resources is built in at a low level. The
typical direction of agents is for clients to be sending agents to
various servers. ( Is there any facility to go the other way? )

It's particularly amazing considering they're only delivering in the

The problem being that there are many things that can't be done
unilaterally - I can't introduce a new HTTP element and have everyone
enjoy its benefits, I can't create a new HTML entity and have the browsers
out there understand it, etc.  This is of course false if I have control
over both the most popular server and the most popular browser, as one
group of developers enjoyed at one point, but we have since learned that
this is not the development model we want to pursue.  (haven't we?) We are
limited to the "building a better mousetrap" model of development right
now - which isn't all that bad, as there is still a LOT of work left to do
there.

    It does.  Except that only the Santa Cruz Mission St. PH is participating
yet.  The web server is in Wichita, Kansas.  It uses a database (possibly one
of those address-to-zip+4 databases) to determine what the nearest PH to you
is, and relays the order to them over a data line.  PH was in a good position
to do this because they already use SCO systems for their operation.  They
installed SCO's Global Access product to get httpd etc., and then set up the
web page with help from SCO engineers.  They have a SCO system in every PH,
which receives the order and (presumably) prints it out.
    Santa Cruz was a pretty good place to start this off, with SCO here, and
net access easy to come by.  UC Santa Cruz (http://www.ucsc.edu), with c. 10K
students/faculty all with net access, is in their delivery range.  There are
open-access sites like this one (http://www.armory.com) that give free dialup
accounts to anyone, and there are lots of commercial options starting at $5/mo.
(http://www.cruzio.com).  Houses on the net (also like this one) are
proliferating (http://klinzhai.iuma.com/~falcon/geeks/geekhouse.html), with
Santa Cruz Community Internet (http://www.scruz.net) offering cheap
SLIP/PPP/ISDN links.
    Here's the press release.

            SCO AND PIZZA HUT ANNOUNCE PILOT PROGRAM
               FOR PIZZA DELIVERY ON THE INTERNET


           "PizzaNet'' Program Enables Computer Users
               to Electronically Order Deliveries



WICHITA, KS AND SANTA CRUZ, CA, SCO FORUM94  (August 22, 1994) --

(NASDAQ:SCOC) In  a revolutionary  spin on  business use  of  the

Information Superhighway,  The Santa  Cruz Operation,  Inc. (SCO)

and Pizza  Hut, Inc.  today announced "PizzaNet," a pilot program

that  enables   computer  users,   for   the   first   time,   to

electronically order  pizza delivery  from their  local Pizza Hut

restaurant via the worldwide Internet.


Pizza Hut  will launch  the PizzaNet pilot in the Santa Cruz area

on August 22 and use it to study the feasibility of expanding the

program to  other cities  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world.

Technology for  the pilot  program includes the SCO Global Access

product, an integrated Internet business server solution. The SCO

Global Access  incorporates advanced  NCSA  Mosaic  software  for

browsing the  Internet, and  the  custom  "PizzaNet"  application

software developed by SCO's Professional Services organization.



SCO Open Server System Provides Access


"The worldwide  Internet, along  with SCO Global Access software,

present us with exciting new opportunities to offer home delivery

services to  our  customers,"  said  Jon  Payne,  Pizza  Hut  MIS

Director of  POS Development.  "The PizzaNet  pilot will  help us

study the  technical feasibility  and gauge  customer response to

these  new  services,  while  taking  an  important  step  toward

integrating our restaurants with the Information Highway."


To participate in the PizzaNet Pilot, customers in the Santa Cruz

area need  computers with  Internet access  and  any  version  of

Mosaic,  such  as  Windows,  Mac,  or  UNIX.  Customers  use  the

Internet's World  Wide Web  to access  the  centralized  PizzaNet

server at  Pizza Hut  Headquarters in  Wichita, Kansas.  This 486

system runs SCO Open Server and SCO Global Access software, using

the Mosaic  and Hypertext  Transfer Protocol to present customers

with a customized menu page for ordering pizza deliveries. Mosaic

is widely used at many technology companies, government agencies,

and universities.  It is  rapidly being  adopted by many business

and home  users in response to the continuing availability of new

and innovative business and information services.


The customer  uses the  menu pages  to enter  name, address,  and

phone information, along with orders for pizza and beverages. The

order is  then transmitted  via the Internet back to Wichita, and

then relayed  via modem  and conventional  phone lines to the SCO

Open  Server   system  at   the  customer's   nearest  Pizza  Hut

restaurant. The  local restaurant  can then  telephone first-time

users to  verify orders.  All money  changes hand at the point of

delivery.


"Pizza Hut  already runs  home delivery  applications on SCO Open

Server at  over 1,000  restaurants, and  that makes it relatively

easy to  integrate this new application into their operations for

the pilot," said Doug Michels, Executive Vice President and Chief

Technical  Officer.  "The  primary  challenge  was  to  create  a

graphical menu  page  that  makes  it  easy  and  convenient  for

customers to  order pizza. The Mosaic component of the SCO Global

Access product  provided the  ideal set of graphical tools needed

for this application."


About SCO Global Access


The SCO  Global Access product family provides the foundation for

businesses to  develop integrated  Internet server solutions. The

Global Access family consists of a supplement for SCO Open Server

systems as  well as an integrated desktop product for testing the

waters of the Internet.


Santa  Cruz  Internet  users  can  access  PizzaNet  by  entering

http://www.pizzahut.com. To  obtain more  information on  SCO via

the Internet, enter http://www.sco.com.


Pizza Hut, a subsidiary of PepsiCo., is the world's largest pizza

distribution  company,  with  more  than  8,200  restaurants  and

delivery units  in the  U.S. and  more than  2,500  units  in  87

countries.  Voted   "Best  Pizza   Quality"  in  a  Restaurant  &

Institutions consumer poll, Pizza Hut is the recognized leader of

the $17 billion dollar pizza category.


SCO is  the world  leader for  UNIX servers  (Source: IDC  1994).

Businesses and  governments use  SCO Open Systems Software to run

their critical  operations, accessing  information across  local,

national, and  international boundaries  and networks.  SCO sells

and supports  its products  in more  than 80  countries through a

worldwide   network    of   distributors,    resellers,   systems

integrators, and OEMs.

Hi,

This is really a CGI/NCSA httpd question - if this is the wrong list
then please ignore it.

I am trying to use server side Includes to make the output of a script 
appear in every directory when a user is browsing the directory tree. 

The 'normal' case works: a program in a '.shtml' file is interpreted - but 
I would like the program to appear in the README.html file so that it works 
in every directory. I have tried creating a README.shtml but that doesn't
work - the program simply does not get interpreted.

I am using NCSA httpd 1.3

Any ideas?

(BTW: Before anyone balks at the idea - it is for a special purpose
application - it is _not_ for a normal Web server.)

Thanks,

John

Hi Darren,
I think we have to discuss it more clear:
 (and this is hopefully the last talk to the whole talklist, because I think
  that the RELATIVE URL-scheme has this short bug (SEE LATER) or lack).

Ok.

Yes, sorry if that wasn't clear...

> Let's say my current directories are A:\one and C:\two and Mosaic is in 
> C:\bin and C:\bin is in my path. My current drive is A: when I invoke 
  ^ Doesn't matter where your Mosaic is.
> Mosaic with file://localhost/./    What should it look for? 
No, no, no. I DON'T invoke Mosaic with "file://localhost/./"!
I will try it again using your example:
  Let's say you invoke Mosaic with a local file named form.htm (supposing
  using DOS and saying 'A:\ONE>Mosaic form.html'). Your document URL at the 
  top of Mosaic now (should) say
  "file:://localhost/A:\one\form.htm", ok?
  In form.htm is a FORM with "ACTION=http://the.server.url/cgi-bin/dotheform".
  This little program assumes that there exists a subdir under your local dir
  from which you started your browser, ie. A:\one\Picdir\Picture.gif.
  The server says (via the output of 'dotheform' for eg. 
    <IMG SRC="PicDir/Picture.gif">
  ), AND THE MOST IMPORTANT: in the HEAD-information is an entry like
  <HEAD><BASE HREF="file://localhost/./"></HEAD>
  because if you don't say something like that Mosaic trys to look for
  the answer <IMG SRC="PicDir/Picture.gif"> at SERVER's side: 
    <IMG SRC="http://the.server.url/cgi-bin/PicDir/Picture.gif"> and this
  will never find this file...
  So what I want is the following:
  1. the browser remembers the full prefix of loading a local file:
     file://localhost/A:\one\form.htm (automatically completed at invokation 
     time)
  2. The browser gets the <BASE>-information and if the returned BASE is 
     "file://localhost/./" (for example! Any other suggestions are welcome!) 
     the server tries to say that 
     the client now has to search at it's local side (in invokation dir), 
     the returned RELATIVE URL belongs to the previous invokation 
     directory, ie. composing 
     "file://localhost/./A:\one\PicDir\Picture.gif"
     will be the right URL.

This seems to be a normal behaviour to me because if you browse local files,
you CAN USE RELATIVE URL's like <IMG SRC="PicDir/Pic1.gif"> or 
<A HREF="Text/HTML/Another/File.HTM"></A> or something like that, even if 
another process changes the current dir (think about side-effects if it 
would be if so!). 
The browser has to complete the 
abbreviation of <IMG SRC="PicDir/...."> to (internally) full: 
  <IMG SRC="file://localhost/A:\one\PicDir\...."> (independantly from the
change of other processes [referring to some more or less multitasking OS]
and this will be the right BASE for ALL following RELATIVE URL's, do you 
understand?

The only (nerving) problem is that a server NOW has to reply the FULL URL in
the <HEAD>-info (ie <BASE HREF="file://localhost/A:\one\">) as a 'prefix'
                                                 ^^^^^^^
                                                 This is something the server 
can't know! Otherwise you have a non-consistent URL scheme: 
  <IMG SRC="http://the.server.url/cgi-bin/PicDir/Picture.gif">

BTW: What about a special environment variable CLIENTS_CURRENT_DIR (or
     something like that)? This would easily solve this problem and that's
     why I ask the talklist (referring to CGI-spec's)

You have to distinguish strictly what happens. Sure, the only way talking
between client and server is using HTTP. But at this time there is no way
to say (at server side) via HTTP: "Keep on looking at your side after 
now!" (to the client) (which will not take care of HTTP in this case; 
otherwise you couldn't browse on any non-connected computer anyway! 
See the source of treating "file://"...it's just an normal "open")

W3O could be the "somewhere prominent" where browser authors, and server
authors, could post their "specs". 
Perhaps using WIT users could send in their remarks regarding effective
compliance.
What be usefull, but would require some work by "motivated individuals", 
would be to define (and maintain?) a standard format for the 
"specs/compliance list" to be directly usable by browsers and servers.

Not to pick nits, but there's actually NO dependence on such things at
all.  One of the innovations of Safe-Tcl was parameterizing the user
interface capability of the language into packages known as "interface
styles".  You can have a graphical interface style (the one you
mention), a terminal-oriented style, or (for non-interactive settings)
none at all.  The interface styles may be queried at run time, so that a
running program may evaluate the available user interaction facilities

Concerning the use of IDL, "Dish" (Dynamic Invocation Shell for Fresco) 
seems to be an interesting example. Fresco operations are specified in IDL, 
Dish is a shell interfacing Fresco to tcl scripts.

One way would be to have a directory-browsing program that dynamically 
generates the list of available files for a given directory, plus whatever 
else you want to generate on the fly.  Yet another reason to put me on 
cache managers' shit lists.  :)

I did something similar for our gateway to the glimpse searching tool - 
check out http://www.wired.com/cgi-bin/aglimpse, and you'll see at the 
bottom a listing of directories by which you can restrict your search 
further.

This doesn't have to upset caching. The Last-Modified: of any given
"virtual document" is simply the latest Last-Modified: of its inputs,
if those are known. So if you know the modification date of the directory
and the modification date of any other files you use as input (and the
modification date of the script itself, if you intend to change it...),
you can give a Last-Modified: header in the response.

Uh... I confess I was actually being only a little facetious here. I don't 
care much for religious debates, which is what RPC vs. messaging appears 
to be turning into. By RPC I meant the Sun/DCE style RPC where you create 
stubs, then call functions as if they are local and the underlying routines
take care of the rest.

There's a few messaging libraries out in the commercial world, mainly
used to connect to database servers for commercial client-server activity.
PeerLogic's Pipes is a big one there. Here, the model is more of a SEND/
RECEIVE activity. Asynchronous activity is the rule not the exception.
DCE is putting asynchronous calls into RPC, but unless your whole
application is event-driven, following a signal model is (IMHO) kind of a hack.

As for whether HTTP is RPC or not. We're definitely talking apples and oranges
here. HTTP is a an applicaiton protocol with high-level "opcodes" like
GET and PUT. Its implementation is completely unrelated to the protocol.
Most current implementation follow the READ/WRITE model. You can argue that
it would be more convenient to use the RPC CALL/RETURN model, or the
messaging SEND/RECEIVE model. It's really not a protocol issue. What I meant
in my previous posting was to replace the *implementation* of HTTP with 
RPC calls (or messaging).

One advantage of the SEND/RECEIVE model is that the application can not
assume that it is going to immediately get a reply back. This forces
the developer to structure the application in such a way as to allow the
user to continue working while the RECEIVE activity is going on. Yes, this
is more complicated than doing a write and sitting there on a read until
all is done, but so was event-based GUI programming vs. prompt-based 
command-line interfaces. Programmers were dragged kicking and screaming
into event-based programming, but everything seems to be fine now (:-)
What we really need is an event-based networking architecture that
takes care of all the underlying grunt work and just notifies the
program when something is done.

Cheers,
R.

What happened to the free-browser/pay-for-editor model?  After this, what 
incentive will there be to make the free version of NCSA's 
Mosaic software even comparable to "Enhanced Mosaic"?

I'd ask this on comp.infosystems.www.misc, but most of the people whose 
opinions I want to hear don't read those newsgroups anymore, and this 
seems more than slightly relevant.

I feel like Richard Stallman's sold GNU to Sun.

University of Illinois Assigns All Future Commercial
Licensing Rights for NCSA Mosaic to Spyglass, Inc.

IBM, FTP Software, O'Reilly and Associates and Firefox Will Distribute
Enhanced NCSA Mosaic from Spyglass to Their Customers

        SAVOY, Ill., Aug. 24 -- To better meet the strong market demand for
easy-to-use Internet access tools, Spyglass, Inc., and the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign today announced a master-license agreement
assigning to Spyglass all future commercial licensing rights for the
University's NCSA Mosaic=81 graphical Internet browser.  Spyglass develops
and distributes commercially enhanced versions of Mosaic for Windows,
Macintosh and UNIX computers.  Spyglass licenses its Enhanced NCSA Mosaic
to networking software companies, systems vendors and online service
providers for incorporation into their products and services.

        Spyglass today also announced that it has formed relationships with
IBM's Networking Software Division of Research Triangle Park, N.C.; FTP
Software, Inc., of North Andover, Mass.; O'Reilly and Associates, Inc., of
Sebastopol, Calif.; and Firefox, Inc., of San Jose, Calif.   Additional
relationships will be announced within the next 30 days.  Since becoming a
commercial licensee of NCSA Mosaic in May, Spyglass has licensed a total of
more than 5 million copies of its Enhanced NCSA Mosaic to these companies
and others, who are integrating it into their products for distribution to
end-users.

        NCSA Mosaic is the most popular graphical browser for the Internet.
More than two million copies of Mosaic are in use, and an additional
30,000 copies are being downloaded each month from the Internet.  NCSA
Mosaic was developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Mosaic gives
users point-and-click access to the World Wide Web, an information
retrieval system on the Internet with more than 3,000 graphical, multimedia
databases of "hyperlinked" documents.  The Internet is a vast
"supernetwork" of public and private networks connecting thousands of
organizations and an estimated 30 million individual users.  New users are
joining the Internet at the rate of more than one million each month, and
hundreds of new WWW servers are coming online each month.  Because of the
reach of the Internet, it offers an attractive vehicle for electronic
publishing and for conducting business globally.


Expanded Distribution and Enhancements for Mosaic

        The new University of Illinois - Spyglass agreement will create a
broader, more practical distribution channel for commercial versions of
NCSA Mosaic.  NCSA Mosaic traditionally has been available in two ways:
for free with copyright to individual users, who must download it from the
Internet; and through a limited number of commercial licensees.

        "With the overwhelming demand for commercial versions of Mosaic,
our distribution system needs to be dramatically strengthened," said Larry
Smarr, director of NCSA.  "Now, working with Spyglass, we'll be able to get
Mosaic to everyone who wants it much more quickly --  largely by mobilizing
lots of vendors who will integrate, add value to and incorporate Enhanced
NCSA Mosaic with their products for distribution to their customers. We
believe that this arrangement will free up NCSA developers to work on
adding new leading-edge capabilities to NCSA Mosaic."

        "This new agreement solves the problem of getting solid,
commercial-quality copies of Mosaic to the tens of millions of people who
want to tap the rich resources of the World Wide Web and the Internet,"
said Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass.  "It will give vendors stable,
standard and feature-rich versions of Enhanced NCSA Mosaic that they can
incorporate immediately into their products -- with little or no additional
development work, if they so choose.  Our ultimate goal is to have people
automatically receive Enhanced NCSA Mosaic as a standard part of their
computer systems, networking software, and commercial online services.  By
this time next year,  there should be more than 20 million copies of
Enhanced NCSA Mosaic from Spyglass in use on desktops."

         According to Joseph Hardin, associate director of NCSA's software
development group, Spyglass is the right partner for NCSA.  The company
has:

* a proven track record in commercializing NCSA technologies;

* demonstrated the ability to deliver commercially enhanced versions of
Mosaic for multiple platforms: Windows, Macintosh and X Windows/UNIX;

* made a number of impressive improvements to NCSA Mosaic;

* established an open licensing program for Enhanced NCSA Mosaic that
supports NCSA's philosophy of open access to Mosaic;

* established impressive product plans for the future;

* begun development on the next generation of Enhanced NCSA Mosaic;

* made a substantial financial commitment to the University of Illinois and
NCSA, helping enable NCSA to continue leading-edge development of Mosaic;
and

* committed to provide improvements for inclusion in the
public-with-copyright version.

        The University of Illinois will honor all agreements with current
commercial licensees, but will be referring inquiries about all future
commercial licenses to Spyglass and encouraging current licensees to work
with Spyglass.  Because Spyglass has committed to license very high volumes
of Mosaic licenses from the University,  the company can offer Enhanced
NCSA Mosaic to current and future Mosaic licensees at very favorable terms.

        The new University of Illinois - Spyglass agreement is an extension
of a multimillion-dollar joint development and licensing agreement signed
in May.  Under the new agreement, NCSA will now focus on research into
advanced features for the next generations of Mosaic, such as voice
recognition, full-motion video, and intelligent agents for searching on the
Internet.  Spyglass will develop and bring to market commercially enhanced
versions of NCSA Mosaic, focusing on large-volume sales to other vendors.

        NCSA will continue to offer a public-with-copyright version of
Mosaic over the Internet, which individuals can download for free.  As part
of its agreement with NCSA, Spyglass will provide a number of its
improvements to NCSA for incorporation back into the public-with-copyright
version.

        In addition to collaborating on Mosaic, NCSA and Spyglass are
working with the new consortium formed by MIT and CERN to drive new
standards and advancements for the World Wide Web.

Licensing Partners Plan Multiple Uses

        IBM's family of TCP/IP products provides a comprehensive set of

Plenty.  We're not talking about Growing Mosaic and Stagnant Mosaic.  The free
version and the commercial version cater to somewhat different audiences.
Not only will the free version continue to be available, it will
continue to be improved.  Also, some improvements from Spyglass will be
worked back into the free version.

The free version will probably always have some features that are
not in the commercial release.  The commercial offering must be a LOT
easier to use than the free version, and that means removing or reworking
any feature which is confusing.  Things like speech recognition and
other more researchy features will be in the free version first.

There's nothing wrong with the "free-browser/pay-for-editor model".  It
will still work if that's the way *you* want it.  However, there are lots
of people who do NOT want a free browser, they want a commercially supported
browser.  Just because a market exists for a commercial version does not
mean a market no longer exists for the free version.

The free version will continue to be improved for the indefinite future.

Good. Now you're using terms that make sense to me. It's a question of
APIs and programming models, in a way [unless and until we really
start talking about sending different bits over the wire, like the
MDMA folks...].

Hah! I think there's an awful lot of kicking and screaming still going
on. I've met a few people that are good at developing apps based on
the OSF/Motif API, but none who like it! The NeXTstep folks seem pretty
happy though, I guess. But NeXTstep has threads, doesn't it?

It's called threads. Developing distributed applications without
threads is enough to drive anybody batty. I spent a year writing a DCE
client with a Motif UI. I could use threads to do DCE stuff, but only
one thread could put it's fingers in the Xt/Motif data
structures. It's a royal pain in the @#$.

That's why I'm so keen on Modula-3: nice gui libraries, threads and GC
in the runtime, yet still allows systems programming and direct
interfacing to C libraries.

Subject: Webmaster's Starter Kit
content-length: 1688

EIT is pleased to prerelease a freeware over-the-web service
for downloading, installing, and customizing a Web server.  This
WEBMASTER'S STARTER KIT uses forms to get basic configuration
information, and writes your config files for you as you download
the software.  It's been taking people only about ten minutes to start
publishing on the Web using this service.

Once the basic server is running, it serves up virtual documents
that can automatically download and install server extensions.  Current
choices are five EIT freeware packages:

  1. a simple form-based home page generator
  2. the verify_links tool for finding broken links
  3. the libCGI library for virtual document programming
  4. the Hypermail engine for webifying mail archives (plus
     a form interface for defining archives)
  5. the Getstats http log analyzer (plus a form interface)

so you can customize your server software in a few minutes more.  The
process automatically maintains a "Server Administration Home Page",
with links to forms-based tools for maintaining the server.

There are versions for SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3, IRIX 5.2, OSF/1 V2.0,
and AIX 3.2.5 (the AIX version is one rev out of date).  SCO UNIX and HP/UX
will come in a few weeks.

Check out http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/doc/, or just find the link near the
end of EIT's home page, http://www.eit.com/ .  Seems to work fine using
recent Lynx as well as recent Mosaic for X.

Suggestions welcome!

This sounds very interesting.  Is there a BSDI version available?

I think, as someone else said earlier, compliance will come in line with HTML
2.0/3.0 specs as they are finalized.  I, too, think that sending this info
out with the HTTP request is kind of overkill, and adds to an already long
request header.

I certainly agree that browsers SHOULD pay attention to the Expires: field,
but it's really of more importance that cacheing proxy servers pay attention
to it - nothing is likely to stay in my (i.e., me running it) AIR Mosaic
cache longer than 5 minutes or so, because I'm usually actively surfing.
Another thing to chalk up on the to do list...

Umm, well, on close examination (My initial reaction was "WHAT?!? No they
don't..."), it looks like they use the file extension for INLINE IMAGES
only.  (Don't look at me, I didn't write that ****. :^)  I was going to say
"I'll have it fixed up in AIR Mosaic in the next day or two", but I was
disgusted enough to go fix it while this email was still on my screen.
It now uses the Content-Type in the MIME headers, as God intended.  :^)

Okay, that's the balance I was looking for.  The press release seemed
misleading on this, and the vacuum of info from within NCSA didn't 
alleviate it.

Brian, you are too easily satisfied (IMHO :-).

Eric, any chance you can specify which improvements will go into the
free version? What criteria will you use?

Allow me to vote on one... I haven't seen the source code yet for the
mac and windows versions from NCSA but I have been told, by Spyglass,
that you pretty much rewrote everything. I heard the same from
Digital, and the same from others. Will the free version from ncsa be
based on their original base code, or on the much improved code base
that you are now using?

I'm sure everyone will vote on security and authentication.

On a slightly different issue, should a developer look to submit
improvements to ncsa or to spyglass? It would seem there might be some
economic reward to offering improvements to spyglass. What about
funded development projects? Shouldn't we be working with the best, most
feature rich base at all times?

Just to revisit the last debate, I think it might be interesting for 
anyone that hasn't looked at Harvest to go to:
	http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/

"..._Harvest_, a system that provides a set of customizable tools for

It really is pretty interesting.  And far too much to summarize in one post.

Goodness, such optimism!  Or perhaps I don't understand what you mean by
code base?  It's hard for me to imagine that Spry would give away the
source that it has written, though it would certainly be wonderful for
all...  Wouldn't that just assure that the free browsers would be serious
competition for Spry?

I didn't mean to say they should give away the source code. I suggest
the free binary we get from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu should be one built from
the spyglass code, not from the original buggy code. In addition it
would be my wish that developers who are submitting code to improve
mosaic would be able to use the spyglass code, via license of course.

The way one might argue it is that if the government helped fund mosaic
development at ncsa.uiuc and ncsa.uiuc licensed the result to a
commercial firm which improved it, shouldn't follow-on government
funded development benifit from the commercial improvement? Why should
government funded work always start from scratch and play catchup?

In any case, I'm not an optimist. I don't expect anything. But it
doesn't hurt to suggest it...

I've been recording the USER_AGENT variable of every client connecting to=

Wired's home page over the past two weeks.  Out of 20800 connections,=20
here's the stats.  I threw away everything in the string after the first=20

=20
cache it goes through (about 5% were going through caches). =20

Notes:=20

"WinMosaic" is version 2.0, before alpha 7 - "NCSA Mosaic(tm) for=20
Windows" is the new alpha 7.

"MacMosaicB6" is any pre-2.0 version.=20

The blank line are the accesses from clients not sending that info=20
along.  Most of those were from "ix.netcom.com", so I'm presuming it was=20
their NetCruiser browser before they put in those stats.

My favorite entries: "WebBunny", "MMMMozilla", "Texture", "Delphi-HTML",=20

If the latest URL draft is to be believed, the proper form for the URL
that corresponds to a DOS/Windows file:

    A:\one\two\form.htm 

is 

   file://localhost/a/one/two/form.htm


That is, 'file' URLs are *NOT* transparent, but rather should reflect
the actual hierarchical structure of the file system.

It is hard to improve on Eric Sink's comments, which well point out really
fundamental things like:

"Just because a market exists for a commercial version does not mean a
market no longer exists for the free version."
and
"The free version will continue to be improved for the indefinite future."

Both are obviously true.

The latter is simply guaranteed by all the good reasons for it.  This is a
powerful enabling technology for scientific and engineering research and
development, and all levels of education, and has just begun to see its
potential realized.  We have no intention of walking away from such useful,
interesting and fun stuff.  There are loads of research problems and
development challenges in front of us.

As to the former:
The world is a complex place; markets are fragmented and are really
composed of numerous sub-markets, which themselves have niches.  Some
people (users, markets) will be happy to put up with our foibles and our
interest in trying new things out.  Other people (users, markets) will be
much more interested in just having something that does whatever job they
are most interested in, thank you very much.  Different needs, desires,
goals = different markets. The public version of NCSA Mosaic was built as a
tool to enable research and education, and NCSA will build on this base to
further its research and public service mission.  And, not surprisingly,
part of this public service mission is to promote open standards; good for
everyone, I think, no matter which 'market' you are in.  It is there that
people can expect to see the most sharing and exchange among WWW and NCSA
Mosaic developers.

Subject: Re: NCSA's un-free browser

While I'm not very happy about such licensing practices, I don't think
this is all that important because:

1) Mosaic isn't all that great. A large part of it's functionality is
   built on top of the code from cern, which is still free. I hope to
   see more and better browsers appear in the future. (This is an
   honest opinion, not flame bait. )

2) Even if Mosaic moves out of the picture, the laws of social
   dynamics will ensure that *something* will evolve to fill it's
   place, just as it is evolving to fill a marketplace need. In some
   ways, it will be better if Mosaic *is* removed from circulation,
   because for many people, WWW equals Mosaic, which is simply not true.

How many ex-NSCA people are at Spyglass? This might be quite similar
to BSDI, though I suspect the potential for making money is *much*
larger... (and no, this is not a rub against BSDI either).

The older I get the more cynical I become...

Ah, I see.  I'd expect them to do so as a matter of course.  It would be
sort of silly for them to maintain two sets of source code and try to make
the same improvements to both, wouldn't it?

As far as the government funding argument is concerned, it's clear to me
that if NCSA did nothing further, it will have already have paid back the
government investment, many times over.  Mosaic was one of the keys to the
Web's rapid adoption, which is spreading fast beyond the
scientific/academic community into business.  We have customers clamoring
for our search capabilities for their Web servers.  I don't see that NCSA
owes the public anything more -- the benefits have probably wildly exceeded
the dreams of their funders.  And I got a really great job out of it, too!
;-)  Furthermore, we're going to hire a few more people, mostly software
engineers in the short run, but I can see our business alone growing really
large; we'll be one of many to benefit.

I hasten to emphasize that NCSA was only one of a number who contributed,
lest CERN and the many others get lost in the glare of publicity.

Interesting statistics, Brian.  Can you perhaps map them to domain types --

This has probably been mentioned before, but Julian Anderson (who is
working on a form of distributed caching for the Web) pointed out that
Mosaic for X sends lines and lines of Accept: headers, followed by
Accept: */* (as it gives the option to save unknown documents into a
file).

Here is one obvious way to reduce the request header length.

  Browsers should only send the '*/*' header when in 'load-to-disk' mode
(or their equivalent).  Another win would be if the clients would send
a different set of headers for inlined images... not much use sending
text/plain when you can only inline image/gif, image/jpeg, or
image/x-bitmap.

  I'm getting ready to add the 'quality' (q=xxx) flag to my emacs-w3
browser.  Is there a standard way to show this in a mailcap entry (I didn't
see one off the bat, but perhaps we could all standardize on an x-yyy
flag).  Perhaps an x-quality so that a mailcap would look like this:

image/gif; xv -perfect %s; needs-x11; x-quality=0.8
image/jpeg; xv -perfect %s; needs-x11; x-quality=1.0
image/x-bitmap; bitmap %s; needs-x11; x-quality=0.2
..
..
..
etc, etc

  Has anyone else implemented this yet, and are there any servers out there
that support shipping off the correct image based on the quality
measurements?  I remember hearing something about a web server from CMU
that allowed you to do a:

GET /some/image/path HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/jpeg
Accept: image/gif

And it would look for path.jpg, then path.gif.

Does anybody have a pointer to this web server, or the web server author?

Indeed.  Given that a lot of items retrieved via HTTP are relatively
small, I've often wondered what percentage of HTTP bytes are totally
useless Accept: headers.  10% or more would not surprise me at all.

It's never been very clear to me what a server should do if it cannot
present an item in a format the client will accept.  Return an error?
Which one?

This seems reasonable; I was exploring adding this to the mailcap spec
a while back.  Nathan was interested, but I sort of let it die because
I wanted to do something more general with file typing and I didn't
detect much interest (I mean, how many clients even bother to parse
mailcap files as currently defined, let alone new features?)

Not to flame you, Bill, but your use of the quality settings above
looks exactly backward to me.  The purpose of quality is to specify
how losslessly the client's viewer can present that content-type.
Presuambly you can display a bitmap losslessly, so you might specify a
quality setting of 1.0.  A GIF might be slightly lossy, say about
0.95.  A JPEG might be lossier still, since there are more colors to
quant down to a 256 colormap, so it might have a setting of 0.9 or
0.8.  Now, naturally there is also lossiness on the server end (there
would be a lot of loss convering a JPEG to a bitmap) which the server
is supposed to calculate and multiply by the client lossiness.

What I would use low quality settings for are things like the
following:

 image/gif; giftoppm | pnmscale -width 80 | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtoascii;\
   copiousoutput

Now, *that's* lossy.  But it does provide a very crude idea of what an
image looks like even on a VT100.

  The Windows-NT server from EMWAC tries to do this, but has a few problems
when it sees multiple Accept: headers instead of having one huge one.  I
believe it just returns one of the more generic error codes (401 or
something like that).

  I think the mailcap parser you wrote in tcl and the one I write in elisp
for my browser are about the only ones.  Did your mailcap parser ever make
it into tkWWW?

  Ahah - just misunderstood what the quality related to.  I'll just send
whatever is shown in the mailcap - it'll be a while before I get to the
point of automatically modifying the mailcap file through a form, etc. :)

  Hey!  I actually used that once when I did inlined 'images' in text mode
for the emacs-w3 browser.  God was it ugly though. :)

Yes, I do like the basic idea.  Actually, I thought *I* was the one who

A new Internet-Draft has been submitted for public comment which may
eventually have implications on the World-Wide Web.

This draft is a work item of the Uniform Resource Identifiers 
Working Group of the IETF.                                                 

       Title     : Relative Uniform Resource Locators                      
       Author(s) : R. Fielding
       Filename  : draft-ietf-uri-relative-url-00.txt
       Pages     : 11
       Date      : 08/24/1994

Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are a compact representation of the 
location and access method for a resource available via the Internet. When 
embedded within a base document, a URL in its absolute form may contain a 
great deal of information which is already known from the context of that 
base document's retrieval, including the access scheme, network location, 
and parts of the url-path.  In situations where the base URL is 
well-defined and known to the parser (human or machine), it is useful to be
able to embed URL references which inherit that context rather than 
re-specifying it in every instance. This document defines the syntax and 
semantics for such Relative Uniform Resource Locators.

Marty, 

	Welcome back.  We have the opportunity to explore IA/agnet vs
CORBA under NIIIP (since one tool NIIIP will use is a CORBA-compatible
OO system). On the message you forward, I would have some reservation
on using Obliq: this product from Iona is one of the best (I talked to
Iona's president every year in ObjectWorld), but I am not sure what's
the commercial future for a platform-indepedent implementation of
CORBA (I saw companies with similar market position failed - Hyperdesk
for one). Oh, yes, one more problem for Iona is that it's based in
Ireland - they need a very good marketing rep at US to have a shot.
This is a pure business talk.

	At this time, the primary CORBA tool is IBM's SOM/DSOM (and
the second candidate, DEC's COM, or Common Object Model, which has an
interesting feature of interoperating with Microsoft's OLE).  Art
Goldschmidt is very interested in exploring the use of IA in
implementing some part of NIIIP infrastructure. I will pursue this
further with him (in fact, very soon - since he will be visiting me
tomorrow: he is here attending a tutorial workshop at Taligent).

	One thing people appreciated IA for is that it is a "working
code" today (even if we can argue whether it is the best "product"
code at this time - I wish I can push for a better implementation
faster) - examples are the SmartProcurement demo for NIST; Sriram at
Lockeed, NIIIP, and Alan Weber on Sematech's distributed CIM
Application Architecure. I had an even stronger appreciation last week
when I was writing the Proposals and completing the demo. Seeing is
believing, and a working code means that people can start
computational experiments NOW (rather than "simluating" on "paper").
Having IA speaking HTTP is a master stroke!  Further, I pointed out in
our proposals that some extensions of the current IA protocols will
make it even more powerful, including extending it to SHTTP (for
secured communication, and may be access control with digital
signature); MBONE for very efficient multi-party message distribution.
Safe-TCL is possibility if it really become commercially "popular" (I
would hate to spend time to include another "research prototype" - we
learned enough lessons :-).

Let's talk further when you can find time.

Quite understandable, given the lack of clearness on what to do.
Unfortunately, this makes it impossible for the client to respond
appropriately (with something like "This document is only available in
formats I do not understand.  Woud you like to download it anyway?", ideally
enumerating which formats it *is* available in and allowing the user to 
choose one.)

In the meanwhile, let me guess, it responds with those famous words, 
"The information server either is not accessible or is refusing to serve the 
document to you." :-)

Initially, our focus will be on the base functionality layers of
Mosaic, getting our changes back into the NCSA code base as well as
to W30 for their ongoing libwww work.

Submit your improvements to NCSA.  Our communication lines with
them are open, as we meet with them periodically on both strategic
and technical levels.

Plenty.  We're not talking about Growing Mosaic and Stagnant Mosaic.  The free 
version and the commercial version cater to somewhat different audiences.
Not only will the free version continue to be available, it will 
continue to be improved.  Also, some improvements from Spyglass will be 
worked back into the free version.
     
     
     Right. In fact, this will hopefully resolve a complaint many had a 
     while back -- that with so many different commercialized versions of 
     mosaic, each being enhanced in their own way, multiple, incompatible 
     standards would evolve for security issues, extentions (add-in 
     modules) to Mosaic, and perhaps even in interpretation of the HTML and 
     Web specifications that would make developing web pages even more 
     confusing than it already is.
     
     IMHO, having one central clearing house for the commercial version 
     should help solve this.
     
     So, Eric, how will the distribution to the various licencees be 
     handled? Will they each get the base source code for the Enhanced 
     Mosaic from Spyglass, and then be free to tweak it themselves, but 
     still required to adhere to certian standards set by Spyglass, or will 
     they simply be given the Executable, to which they can add value by 
     way of extentions, browsers, and packaging?

The ports should be simple, but I don't have those environments up.
I've been meaning to bring them up, but it's not clear how soon I
can (especially BSDI, which I'll have to purchase).

Or, if someone can loan me an account on such systems, I can do the
ports with telnet.  That's how I did the AIX port, courtesy of

content-length: 2390


The Macvicar School of Education and Technology is a school which is a
part of the Globewide Network Academy.  It specializes in producing
non-credit computer related courses and educational software products.
All products of the Macvicar School are covered under the GNU Public
License.

It has thus far succeeding in producing an online introduction to the
internet course, a course on commodities trading, and a course on C++
which won the 1994 Best of the World Wide Web award.

MSET is also responsible for producing the freely redistributable WWW
editor tkWWW and is producing the Global C++ Library, a set of freely
redistributable library routines.  Both these products have been or
will be covered under the GNU Copyleft, and MSET intends to cooperate
fully with the Free Software Foundation in incorporating these and
other products into the GNU distribution.

The courses taught up to now have not required cash tuition from the
students, but instead have sustained themselves by having the students
of one semester serve as administrators and teachers for the next
semester of students.  We have found that these types of courses run
quite smoothly once the initial hurdle of getting an interested group
of teachers together has been cleared and are anxious to set up other
courses along the lines of our internet and C++ courses.

The texts of some of the courses thus far produced can be found at URL

http://uu-gna.mit.edu:8001/uu-gna/text/index.html

The mailing list for the Macvicar School of Education and Technology
is up and running.  You can subscribe yourself to the list by
e-mailing 

listproc@moose.uvm.edu

with the command

Subscribe mset-talk <Your name>

Topics for discussion on the list:

+ What courses do we organize now? 
  (Perl course? C course? basic UNIX? Web authoring? Programming? 
   Compiler design? Windows?)
+ Policies and procedures for the Macvicar School
+ Long term goals (accreditation? degree programs?)
+ Budget, fundraising, and finance issues 
+ Coordination with other GNA schools, and with the GNA core projects

MSET is in need of volunteers who are willing to help set up
computer-related courses and of people who can help out with
administration and organizational work.  Any interested persons should
get on the mset-talk list and post a brief introduction of themselves
and what types of projects they may be interested in.

Before anyone else gets tempted, why don't you just ask the folks at
EIT and stop CC:ing the damn list, huh?  And while you're at it, try
rereading the Usenet primers where they say to tidy up quoted material
--- it works just as well in e-mail.

It would seem to me that it wouldn't be hard to define an internal API (or 
set of APIs for the different classes of features) to the free browser such 
that public modules and private modules can work together easily.  For 
the ambitious, the private modules could be supplied as pre-compiled link 
objects, so that people wishing to make changes to the public portions of 
the code can do so easily (and stalling off the temptation from the 
companies putting out the browser to change the way everything works).
The definition of these API's is certainly out of my league, though.

Also, as for "multiple, incompatible standards"... I'm not worried about 
that, for it's pretty easy to divorce the protocols from the 
client/server design, and any company that tried to introduce its own 
proprietary standards without working within the developer community 
will, well, have their work cut out for them.

I recently tried to work out an arrangmennt where I would enhance
parts of Moisaic (or Web parts in general ) and donate the work
to the NCSA. They told me I would have to purchase the licsense
from spyglass or get a federal grant to see the source code.
How have others dealt with this? Is it fair for a federally
funded research effort of which I have helped pay for and
could probably help make better for the true masses (IMHO :)
and now can't even touch. Are they now profiteering and 
"selecting" who should profit from this on our behalf??
Don't they have to hold a bid to see who gets to mantain
the (potentially ) lucrative licsense and development buisness?
Can we get specific information regarding there proposed new
Mosaic (or whatever it is). Is this an open approach or are
they trying to keep it to themselves for the good of us?

Am I whinning or do others share my concerns?

Should we skip NCSA Mosaic and thank it for the spotlight
and jumpstart in this technological area and go on to bigger
and better techniques (not hard to do!)?

Yes, I have used it repeatedly, and have found it very fast.  I haven't 
generated any enormously complex queries.  I'm a beta tester, so I will 
be thrashing it pretty soon on my local machine.

Let's say that it works enough to be on my hotlist.  Some other search 
sites don't cooperate behind my proxy.

I have parts of the Harvest subsystem running here.  It was a *simple* 
compile and install, something that is easily overlooked, especially with 
~23 Mb in the compiled distribution:
	du -s ~/src/harvest
	23069   /home/paul/src/harvest

What drew me to it was reading the file:
	ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/Harvest.ps.Z
Many of the things I've been thinking about, specifically in 
server-server interaction and addressing some of the capabilities of 
Lotus Notes, are in that paper.

To each of these messages, I now send a "canned" reply (see below)
stating that I no longer have resources to support this package.

This is in addition to the "status of www_and_frame" message at:

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/www_and_frame.html

which states that I can't support the package and I'm looking for a
new maintainer.

Matt Ranney <mjr@syl.dl.nec.com> has been supporting the package in my
stead for some time. [Thanks, Matt]. But he's running out of time to
spend on this thing too.

But certainly, by now, one of the other Frame/HTML packages is better
than this one, no?

Which one do folks actually use? I'd like to have something to recommend
to folks who inquire about www_and_frame.

Alternatively, if none of the other options really solves the problem,
would somebody like to pick up www_and_frame and enhance it? I'm
willing to consult. And I have some code I was working on a while ago
that I never got a chance to clean up for release. Let me know if
you're interested.

I'm afraid that the prerelease of the Webmaster's Starter Kit
(http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/doc/) doesn't work well behind a firewall,
as reported to me by several people.

The basic server will install but the automatic downloading of
extensions involves a background HTTP transaction that doesn't
know how to use proxies. 

I'll look into routing the downloads through proxies; those of
you using proxies may want to wait for the next release.

  Hi,

     I want to install mosaic (version 2.4) from sources for
  SGI machines. We have the SGI version 5.2. 
  It compiled correctly and made the executable src/Mosaic.
  Also gave that message..."Welcome to Mosaic"!

  But there is a wierd problem. Though .html documents are being
  fetched, there is no display whatsoever. The mosaic 
  screen remains completely blank. Even the Mosaic Home page
  is not displayed though the document is definitely fetched.
  It doesn't signal any error either. I tried using the "save as"
  button to save the retrieved documents. The saved file contains
  the document allright, but it appears "unformatted" in the sense
  that I get the text as a vertical list of single words.

  Obviously, there is some "formatting" problem. Hence the display
  is also getting affected.

  Would someone know what this problem is ?

  thanks,
   shankar

Right, but I just got a press release from SCO on my desk this morning (paper,  
note), which claims that "Pizza Hut  launched the PizzaNet pilot in the Santa  
Cruz are and are using it to study the feasibility of expanding the programme  
to other cities in the US and around the world."  


The press release goes on to talk about SCO Global Access product which  
incorporates Mosaic and "custom PizzaNet software."

Is anybody here involved in this?

Many thanks for taking the trouble to send me your comments. They
appear to relate to an obsolete version of the HTML+ DTD. An up to
version can be found at:

        ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/htmlplus.dtd.txt

I am in the process of adapting this DTD for the initial HTML 3.0 draft
spec which will be elaborated by the IETF working group on HTML.

What semantics, if any, are associated with the Location: header if 
the status code returned by the server is 200 (OK)?

This question is prompted by the following problem I have with my
Windows NT HTTP server.

When an ISMAP image is clicked on, the server recieves a URL like
"/UK.MAP?126,43".  If this maps to a remote file (ie the UK.MAP file 
contains some URL starting http://...), the server issues a 302 
status and a Location: header with the mapped-to URL.  The client 
goes off and fetches it, no problem.

If the point 126,43 maps to a local file, the server delivers the
file directly, without doing a redirect.  The problem with this is
that the client records the URL as "/UK.MAP?126,43" which causes
problems if the document is not located in the same directory as
UK.MAP and contains relative URLs.  It also causes problems if the
document contains an <ISINDEX>.

Clearly, the workaround is to use full URLs in the map file, but this 
results in an unnecessary extra connection.  

It would be good if the server could use the Location: header to 
indicate the actual URL of the document being served.  Do any clients
support this?  If so, I'll implement it in the server.

Hi,

Could someone recommend me a good HTML editor? I've been writing html 
scripts for my university for a while, and I have some problems with 
editors. We use the Mosaic browser, and when I used an editor called 
HTMLed, the browser simply couldn't read the scripts, I got the 
source in the window. I tried another one, HoTMetaL, and this time 
there was some disagreement between the editor and the browser as 
concerns the markup conventions (the editor didn't recognize source 
files written manually that the browser displayed with no problems, 
also it introduced some nesting restrictions that the browser didn't 
know). I suppose this is caused by different implementations of the 
html specifications. Does anybody know of any editor that would cause 
no such problems? I'm rather interested in a shareware solution. 
Thanks a lot,

  hehe  - M-x amen. :)  To clarify:

  I meant a mailcap parser that correctly understands the latest mailcap
draft, with needsx11, etc.  And of course, any good mailcap parser should
actually _use_ the test=.... field, and not just blindly take the first one
it finds, which is what Mosaic does, therefore I don't count it. :)

  I did leave one out of the list though - lynx 2.3 (maybe as early as 2.2)
does honor the test clause.

Hello, everyone...

My name is Andrew Zolli, & I am a student at Vassar College in New York State.
I am having trouble using AppleScript and MacHTTP together. I can't even get
prewritten scripts to work properly. My problems include:

1. I can't seem to get my browser to find a script when it is present, even 
   though my configure file is set up to find scripts.

2. I'm not sure where the scripts should be stored (i.e. in what folder?
   with MacHTTP? With the HTML pages? With AppleScript?

3. I'm not sure what format scripts have to be in.
   (I keep reading conflicting things on this!)

If anyone is using this software, or has any information at all, please PLEASE
let me know. I need to implement searches and clickable maps in my Web Docs.

Many Thanks...
Andrew Zolli

  The Location: header should be _IGNORED_ if it is not given with one of
the 3xx error codes.  If its not, the browser is broken.

   I believe you can get the behavior you want by using the BASE tag.
Something like:

<base href="/the/real/path/not/UK.MAP...">

  at the beginning of the file (in the <head></head> area) should do the
trick.  AIR Mosaic, XMosaic, and Emacs-w3 all support the base tag.  Not
sure of any others, but I'm sure I'm probably missing some.

      I'm very fond of HTMLAssistant.  I started with the somewhat limited
version off the nets, and liked it so well that I went ahead and spent
the $69 US  (I think) for the full version with manual and such.  It is
wonderful.  It is particularly convenient to run it in windows and then
click up the Mosaic from the 'test' button in it and look at your html,
test the links, etc.  Since the same machine also runs my server, every
update is automatically done on the pages that users are grabbing, if you
wish to do it that way (and I do).

I am writing an HTTP server and I plan to have it recognize URLs 
like the following:

	http://host/dir1/dir2;search=wais?query

	http://host/dir1/dir2;search=keyword?query

	http://host/dir1/dir2;search=title?query

	http://host/dir/file;info

These will do various types of searches or in the last case
provide a description of the file generated on the fly.

My question is will the use of the ';' as a delimiter for parameters
cause any conflicts with current or planned usage. According to 
the most recent document I can find on the subject the ';' is reserved
(see excerpt below) but there is no indcation of its intended use.
By my reading of this document it is completely legal to have a
';' in my URL if it is URL escaped.  But I would like to know
if it can be unescaped as in the examples above.

Here is an excerpt from:
    Uniform Resource Locators                           T. Berners-Lee
    draft-ietf-uri-url-06.txt                           L. Masinter
    Expires March 13, 1995                              M. McCahill

Begin excerpt
   An HTTP URL takes the form:

      http://<host>:<port>/<path>?<searchpart>
   ...

   Within the <path> and <searchpart> components, "/", ";", "?" are
   reserved.  The "/" character may be used within HTTP to designate a
   hierarchical structure.

I think accessability is a valid concern, but NCSA has not donated the
Mosaic code to the public domain.  I'm not going to argue how involved 
you have a right to be just because it's partially federally funded.
I will say that managing bugs in donated code is not appealing, and this 
is a consideration.  There may be other ways to get involved, including
developing applet programs (via interprocess communication), and 
demonstrating your ideas without needing to build them into a browser.

> Are they now profiteering and 
>"selecting" who should profit from this on our behalf??

I'd say NCSA has decided not to spend the resources to honor every license 
request, and as a result the current solution has developed.  NCSA is not
required to throw resources at each and every user request (like other
government agencies) - not even for licensing.  NCSA _is_ trying to make
money off of Mosaic, which is why we are licensing it.  Since federal
research money is harder to come by these days, this is not unfair.  On
the contrary, it ensures a better product is available to the public.

>Don't they have to hold a bid to see who gets to mantain
>the (potentially ) lucrative licsense and development buisness?

No.  But if so, when?  Now that everybody is rushing to license - or
at a time to prepare for the current rush?

>Can we get specific information regarding there proposed new

New versions of Mosaic will continue to come from both NCSA and Spyglass.
NCSA is committed to open standards developmed by the Web community.
Spyglass is following the same open standards.

>Am I whinning or do others share my concerns?
Is this necessarily an "or" question?

>Should we skip NCSA Mosaic and thank it for the spotlight

The plan is that you need not skip NCSA Mosaic to move on to
better technologies for information presentation.

Hi,

Well having been away from Brunel for 2 weeks I come back and find that they 
are trying to install a HyperG server and looking at it to replace the HTTPDs 
that we have. I never got the server running when I tried a long while back, 
but they are still trying - and waxing lyrical about what it can do that the 
HTTPDs cant.

So what I want to know is this.

* Does anyone have any experience with this?
* What is the main advantage of HTTPDs (one person mentioned automatic indexing 
  but I find that a tad dubious)?
* And what are the main disadvantages? 
* Should anyone consider moving to HyperG? (I dont think so but I need to know 
  for sure :)

Thats all I can think of now :)

Paul

There has been some talk about modular web browsers here so I thought
I would just let everyone know that I just put a version of chimera
out for ftp that allows:

External data converters (these have been used by chimera since Nov. 1993)
External protocol handlers (added a few weeks ago)

For example, chimera doesn't support NNTP directly.  A friend of mine
wrote a perl script that talks to an NNTP server and returns the
result as HTML.  HTTP (simple and it is already in chimera)
is used by chimera and the protocol program to exchange information.

He wrote code to deal with finger URLs in about 5 minutes without
changing chimera.

It doesn't allow forms data to be passed to the protocol programs
but that capability should be pretty easy to add.

The external data converters allow chimera to use Postscript, JPEG, or
whatever else you want as inline images.  The external converters
are also used to do decompression and uudecoding of documents and
to do other types of conversions.

The beta version of chimera that supports the above features is available
for anonymous ftp at:

ftp://ftp.cs.unlv.edu/pub/chimera-misc/xc16-1.60.tar.gz

The chimera home page is

Actually, it responds with satus 400 and a message "The document is 
of a type which is not supported by your client".

I hereby propose using a new status code 405 for this 
purpose:

  Unsupported Type 405
  The object requested has a MIME type which does not correspond to
  any of the types which the client indicated it can accept.

Is returning this code going to break any existing browsers?

Talking about modular web browsers and interaction leads me to a
question.

I have a corporate customer who is seeking a method to interact
between a Web server and Lotus Notes.

I may have missed information on this, having just returned from
a three week vacation but, does anyone know if there are any tools
available to share information in both directions -- or -- failing 
that a Lotus Notes contact.

Thanks for any info, Nigel Willson.

Not only that: If you want to move a map file to another directory or
even to another host, you have to manually edit the map file, which is
tedious and error prone. I wish we had relative URIs in map files!

(I assume for the moment, that the URI header is meant with
"Location".) The relevant part of the HTTP specification is
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html#uri>.

And there's no word about any status codes with which URI is
allowed or not allowed. The wording indeed suggests a use of URI
with a 200 header: "... it is guaranteed that if an object is
successfully retrieved using that URI it will be to a certain given
degree the same object as this one."

I think application Chris is talking about is a very good example
of what a URI header is good for with a status code of 200. 
Browsers should support it.

Hi all.  I am in a project that is creating an online format from 
several years worth of several magazines.  The goal is to decompose each 
edition into individual articles, and have a search mechanism, with other 
bells and whistles like corresponding with the author, corresponding with 
other readers, etc.

I have spent a lot of time with IAFA templates, ALIWEB, and now Harvest.  
What I am looking for now is just plain experiences -- how should I 
approach the "taxonomy" of this?  What "library science" issues should I 
investigate (ISBN numbers, etc.)?  Where can I go for more info?

Thanks for any help.

Would you mind putting a direct link to a date archive (as apposed
to haveing to press the "date" button in the thread archive).

Why?

For some reason that is beyond me, I find that if I enter an article
and then back out, Mosaic loses the location that I was viewing.
It puts me up at the top article. 

Oddly this will not happen if one views the thread-ed list in
threaded mode. But when viewing in date mode, this does happen.

Very odd.

You could post your message in web4lib@[berkeley I think] and
PACS-L@uhupvm1.uh.edu.  The latter is the venerable Public Access Computer
Systems for Libraries forum.  There's probably an indexing mailing list
somewhere as well.  I'm sure many librarians would like to provide you
with advice.

I've been asked off list for more info on htmlAssistant, and one of
my correspondents reminds us of Archie.  It is on a number of servers
that you can ftp it from.  Also, the author is   harawitz@fox.nstn.ns.ca
if you wish more details or to purchase the complete package, which
is even more wonderful than the shareware version.

Subject: User personal pages.
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
content-length: 1063

Hello,

I maintain Auburn University College of Engineering www server.  I am looking
solutions to handle allowing users have personal "home" pages.  Right I
have it set-up to use the ~ expansion option.  But in the future I can
see this is being a problem as more and more of our users develop pages.  The
problem I see with this is the ~ expansion automounts the home directory of
the user thus it is possible to have all the home dir servers mounted.

I am interested in hearing any other ideas on how to allow users
personal pages without the pages being in the home dirs.

If you do not use the ~ expansion what kind of limitation do you put on
the users if any.

Thanks for the info/insight.

Can you provide some clear indication of where you are headed in this
regard?  There would seem to be several potential strategies for
integrating third-party executables -- PPC, as you mention, client CGI
(CCI) or some sort of plug-in scheme.

I'll have to look into this further, but we may have a solution.  Our
engine is built into Notes as its search system and we also have a Web
server built on the same engine... which means that you could use our Web
server to search through Notes information.  Going the other way might be
trickier, but I'm sure something could be cobbled together.

What kind of interaction would you (or anyone else with similar needs) want
to have?

Two suggestions --

Join the Web4Lib mailing list (subscribe via listserv@library.berkeley.edu)
and ask questions there.

There's a new book called "Indexing Books" by Nancy Mulvany (University of
Chicago Press; ISBN 0-226-55014-1) that looks really good.  I have it and
I've skimmed it; others have highly recommended it.  If nothing else, it'll
give you an appreciation for the depth of knowledge necessary!

 RELEASE 
 
      EMBEDDED PROGRAM OBJECTS IN DISTRIBUTED HYPERMEDIA SYSTEMS

 Researchers at the U. of California have created software for embedding
 interactive program objects within hypermedia documents.  Previously,
 object linking and embedding (OLE) has been employed on single machines or
 local area networks using MS Windows -TM-.  This UC software is the
 first instance where program objects have been embedded in documents 
 over an open and distributed hypermedia environment such as the 
 World Wide Web on the Internet.
     The researchers' first application, already ported to an X Window
 environment, enhances NCSA Mosaic -TM- -a client program for the WWW- so
 that the user can interactively control the display of a 3D medical image
 -generated from a gigabyte-sized data set- on a window within a Mosaic
 document. The user can rotate the object at will, zoom in or out, do
 oblique sectioning, highlight hidden parts, alter the color mapping and
 image contrast, all under real-time control. These capabilities represent
 a substantial improvement over current image display applications in
 Mosaic, which are limited to display of static images and non-interactive
 playback modes.
    It is anticipated that many additional applications which require
 advanced real-time large-scale data processing could be developed from
 this technology. Numerous commercial opportunities for software sales -to
 both clients and servers- and database subscription services could arise
 from products based on the UC embedded program objects. Such applications
 might include:

 - internet accesible on-line databases, software libraries, and software
   demos which involve large-scale data processing
 - 'smart' documents for personal forms, financial or consumer
   transactions, credit reports, confidential communications, etc.
 - virtual reality applications
 - real-time high-level information exchanges, such as multiuser CAD
 - multi-users 'groupware' programs

Why would anybody want to donate code to a profit-making enterprise?

Good stuff.  You may want to consider using CGI as your interface
to protocol handlers.  It covers all the information you need in
environment variables and has ways to handle POST data and the like.

You may say "But CGI is for servers".  Yes, it is, but you can look
at those external protocol handlers as servers.  You could handle
unknown protocols by connecting to an HTTP server and giving it
the full URL and have it gateway for you.  That's done all the
time by proxy servers.  What you've done is cut out the HTTP middleman
and directly run the gateway.  With the HTTP server out of the way,
CGI logically follows as the interface.  Well, it _does_ make sense,
I may just not be explaining it well.

I've got some code which almost does what you want (except that it's
tied to a particular URL scheme), look under
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/world/exec/intro to find it.

Sorry, this was done years ago in a number of systems -- CMU's freely

Yeah, I always wince whenever someone mentions "WWW" and "first" in the 
same breath, because they're usually hyping something that doesn't need 
to be hyped and/or are just flat out wrong.

For an idea just how difficult this issue is (and for a pretty
fair discussion of its 5,000+ year history) may I recommend:

	Tom McArthur, 
	"Worlds of Reference: lexicography, learning and language from the
	clay tablets to the computer"
	Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,
	Hardback 1986:  ISBN 0.521 30637 X
	Paperback 1988: ISBN 0 521 31403 8

This is probably out of print, but worth a trip to the library to find.
In short, classifying all human knowledge is a very difficult task
and one that human beings have participated in since the beginning of human
history.  The systems that arise are deeply culturally conditioned,
impermanent, and context sensitive.  You can easily spend a lifetime
(or two or three) working at this problem. 

A good starting place might be a long discussion with some librarians,
maybe especially whoever directs the cataloging in a large university
library (or maybe someone on the library science faculty)?
There are books that lay out the classification systems used by the Library of
Congress and by various other cataloging schemes (Dewey Decimal, and The ACM
Computing Reviews abstracts has one of its own).  A good reference
librarian could point you to some of these.

Hiroaki> Could you kindly clarify what HyperG is?

Information on Hyper-G can be found under

                ftp://iicm.tu-graz.ac.at/pub/Hyper-G

In short, Hyper-G is a distributed hypermedia system designed for
maintaining large quantities of documents and links. The Server
maintains a link database, which allows to keep up consistency of the
web and to aid in navigation (e.g. by displaying link maps). There are
many more interesting features which I cannot possible mention here
(see ftp address above).

A Hyper-G server is accessible using WWW (for an example try URL
http://info.tu-graz.ac.at) and even Gopher clients. However, to fully
exploit its potential, you need a Hyper-G client. Two such clients are
available as alpha versions: Harmony (for UNIX/X11) and Amadeus (for
PC/MS-Windows), in addition to a VT100 interface, on above FTP server.

If you should experience problems accessing above FTP server, the
Hyper-G archive is mirrored nightly to

    ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/Networked.Information.Retrieval/Hyper-G

There is a mailing list for information and discussion about Hyper-G.
The developers and maintainers of the system inform the list about new
contents and features, and are in turn interested in user feedback
(such as problem reports, suggestions, wishes, complaints).
 
Since the list is unmoderated, please avoid sending junk mail and
auto-replies to the list!
 
To subscribe or unsubscribe, send mail to "listproc@iicm.tu-graz.ac.at"

The problem with taking a proxy server sort of approach is that we have
huge customers who want to send information to people who have no Internet
connection at all.  Yet the publishers only wants to support one interface
and one protocol.  No problem for plain documents, but as soon as you want
to add functions that would normally be at the server, such as search and
retrieval, relevancy ranking and the other stuff we do, you have to
integrate it into the client somehow.

Re-reading that, I think I should point out that *most* of the intended
audience have an Internet connection.  It's just that for some small
percentage, there isn't one at all, and for a larger subset, it may be
intermittent, slow, etc.

	This seems to be a problem with Mosaic for X - sometimes it
loses that scroll placement information when backing up, especially
if you've loaded large pages. I've done some basic tests and can
pretty consistently replicate this on Mosaic for X 2.4, I haven't
had problems with MacWeb or MacMosaic.
	Could this be a memory-related problem?

All the versions of htmlasst.zip that I found via archie are very very out of 
date, and have significant bugs. The version found via the NCSA Mosaic pages is 
0.25A - quite ancient. The latest version can be found at

ftp://ftp.cs.dal.ca/htmlasst

There you will find the freeware 1.0A version and a no-license fee beta version 
of the "Pro" (commercial version). The Pro flavor has a nicer, more compact tool 
bar interface along with some other goodies.

In some cases, all this business of converting mail, gnu info, FAQs
etc. to html on servers adds value: folks tend to add database searching
support; they tend to make the stuff generally more accessible to WWW
clients while they're at it.

But wouldn't it make a lot more sense to support mail syntax and gnu
info syntax in WWW clients?

Every HTTP client already has code to parse RFC822 headers to deal
with HTTP return messages. The same code could be used to parse mail
messages from local disk, or from FTP servers, etc.

Support for viewing message/rfc822 (with recursive MIME body part handling...)
and gnu info format object should be part of libwww.

I've done message/rfc822 support in a protype client, so I know it can
work. And I know other folks have done info->html converters.

Hmmm...

Sorry, I was far from clear.  I didn't mean to suggest that a proxy
server approach was the way to do this, but mentioned it to show
that CGI is a rational choice for the browser <-> extension interface.
That is, I see it working like this:

	browser get's protocol it doesn't understand
	it builds up all the CGI environment variables etc. and
		forks off some program to deal with it
	program does whatever is necessary and communicates back
		in the standard CGI ways

No servers and no internet necessary.

Ah, now I understand.  It's easy for me, as one who really doesn't write
code (just prototypes) to appreciate the idea that client CGI is preferable
because one API is better than two... but I'd also like to hear if there
are other opinions.  For example, is there overhead associated with
implementation of client CGI (memory footprint, CPU cycles) that will make
it less practical on desktop PCs than a PPC/IPC approach (DLLs, OLE,
AppleEvents, etc.)?

Or perhaps should there be both -- leverage the CGI work with client CGI,
but also have a lower-level API for environments where memory and speed are
at a premium?

But what I'm really after is -- am I asking the right questions?

I would like to see more information about this subject.  I have
a very keen interest in any integration between the two.  My 
particular reasons are:

	* Notes will be used for our internal Corporate workgroup library,
	  as our bulletin board, for workflow apps and for point applications.

	* The Web and Mosaic is our potential external, electronic interface 
	  to our customers and the public.

	*  Combining the two would be very powerfull as we hopefully would not 
	   have to reproduce the same information twice for different information
	   systems.

This is true, but leniancy on the various mail->html authors should be 
given: trying to turn the raw anarchy of email-based communications into
useful and correct HTML is a staggering task.

If we have to choose one API, don't make it CGI. CGI might be ok for clients,
where there's only one person doing anything, so there's plenty of spare CPU,
but for server performance it's the kiss of death

As soon as public/group annotation comes back (and some of us aren't 
waiting for it to be implemented directly) then Notes as an interface for 
bulletin boards will be unnecessary.  I'm not sure what "point" 
applications are...

So don't reproduce it.

We tried giving Notes a spin here - bought an OS/2 box for it and spent 6 
days of valuable sysadmin time installing it.  Once up, the Mac clients 
were constantly crashing and had huge memory requirements.  I have a 
deep admiration for places that actually got it installed and use it - we 
don't.

The mind boggles at the idea of what could be accomplished if a quarter 
of the effort spent on behemoth corporate software was instead directed 
at WWW development.

Subject: Re: Mail etc. syntax support in WWW _clients_
content-length: 1401



Phil Hallam Baker and I are currently working on getting a new MIME
parser into the World-Wide Web Library of Common Code - it has been on
the working list for a long time.  The idea is to get it finished this
fall. Furthermore, I am experimenting with the stream stack so that
converting `raw' data from NNTP, FTP, Gopher etc. into HTML is done
just like all the other conversions as for example text/plain ->
text/html. Then, of cause, they can also be parsed as `*/*' so that the
client can get the original data sent from the remote servers.

This means basically that the library from being HTML based turns into
a generic protocol code base with a set of independent protocol
modules. A combination of this also gives the possibility of viewing
rfc822 messages - both HTML formatted and the original message.
Multipart, however will not get implemented right now - simply because
of the amount of other work to be done :-(

Thanks for the empathy.  Some people seem to forget that us mail->html
authors are doing alot of the work on our spare time.  Plus the stuff
is free.

Regardless of what mail->html converter you use, one can provide a WAIS
index (or other fulltext search index) to the mail converted.  I do not
see why much effort should be put into adding fancy searching
capabilities to a mail->html program when there are tools out there can
do the job.

Since one can incorporate their own HTML in the index page I create
with my program, hooking a form that provides searching capabilites
thru WAIS (or other program) is easy.  And I'm sure that it isn't that
difficult to incorporate a search form to with other existing
mail->html programs.

Since the "effort spent on behemoth corporate software" is probably at the
annual level of several billions of dollars, collectively, minds should
boggle at what could be effected should 25% be directed towards improving
some particular public project. 

However, let me point out that I am full agreement with Brian Behlendorf's
apparent assumption that the redirection of some significant amount of
resources towards coordinated improvements in WWW technology is generally
a very good idea.

Is anybody able (willing) to offer some notions as to what sorts of
significant advances might be obtained with an influx of support
(especially those that are not likely to occur without such support) and
also, perhaps, provide some rough estimates as to what might be done with
what level of new support?

Good idea, but I would like to use HTTP because the code is already
in chimera to do it.

It seems like a CGI interface could be put on top of the external
protocol handler for the folks that would like to use CGI.
I'll see if I can con a friend into doing it :)

Unfortunately this causes CGI code to be duplicated if you have
more than one external protocol program.

Does this make any sense?

I know that there was some discussion of standards for inclusion of HTML in
mail and Usenet discussions, but I don't think there was any closure on it.
I'm considering adopting some such standard for the server that we're soon
going to put on-line, which will contain a comprehensive index to Web
publishing and Web library information, including HTML-ized mail and Usenet
articles.  I'd like to support some standard way to mark HTML as "example,"
so that it won't be interpreted by the HTML-izer, but will be converted to
read as source.

I'm even considering -- feel free to argue -- generating an automatic
e-mail (ONCE per person) to anyone who posts with embedded HTML, advising
them that their article is in the archive/library as HTML and explaining
how to mark it as "example" HTML.  This would presumably propogate a
standard to the community rapidly...

Is this different from MIME? The MIME spec certainly has reached
closure (except for uuencode... :-), and it will do nicely for
this. You just add two headers:

	MIME-Version: 1.0
	Content-Type: text/html

Hmmm... this is tricky. At first, I'd think anything marked text/plain
should be treated as "example." But lots of stuff gets tagged text/plain
when the user really intends for the markup to be treated as markup.

How about something like:

	Content-Type: text/plain; look-for-html=no

If you can do it without pissing anybody off, great! Well, you're
guaranteed to piss somebody off. If you can do it without creating
an anti-HTML or anti-WWW sentiment in the USENET/mail community,
I suppose I'm in favor of this.

I suggest we use MIME, the internet standard for multimedia messaging,
in the various internet information system; specifically, I request
that WWW server announcements use MIME to designate HTML in mail/news
messages.

To illustrate, I include an annoucement recently sent to www-announce.

The announcement was prefaced with:

 The announcement comes both as a text file and a html file, to access the
 html version cut out everything between the rows of dashes and save as
 a file, then use your web reader to access it as a local document

I have added MIME headers to that message to make these intentions
machine readable. Any reader with a MIME mail user agent (and there
are many: PINE, Eudora..., and soon there will be many more) can
use their mailer to carry out the above instructions.

I request that the maintainers of www-announce, whats-new,
comp.infosystems.announce, and related services support MIME by making
MIME documentation and examples available to their contributors. This
will increase the value and usablility of these postings, and
(eventually) decrease the amount of hand-work for the list maintainers
and for readers around the globe.

July, 1992...

The fact is that a lot of corporate software money already is heading
toward the Web in a hurry.  I can't quantify it, but we're seeing
tremendous interest in our Web products.  Large companies in particular
realize that information is a strategic asset.  The Web offers a way to
integrate information from heterogeneous sources, which is a huge issue
these days.  There's a lot of "legacy" data that would be valuable to make
available via consistent UIs -- Mosaic and its kin.  What's more, the open
and pervasive nature of the Internet allows companies to make information
available to their partners and customers as well.  If "help desk" software
can be available on the customer's desktop, that's going to be a huge
savings for many businesses.

There are big issues that arise, of course.  Problems for the users are
opportunities for businesses.  One of the really great things is that so
much of the software development is already "solved" -- cross-platform UIs,
in particular -- that very small teams, even individuals, can write
significant applications.  I suspect that alone will spur a lot of
creativity.

Oops, didn't make myself clear.  It's really the second issue that I was
asking about -- a standard for when HTML is to be interpreted or not.  The
complication is that a single message might include HTML that should be
interpreted and some that is "example" HTML.  Right now, I skirt the issue
in my converter by treating everything as if it were an example, then I
make URLs hot, too, and a few other things on a "best guess" basis.

There are people who are offended by *any* unsolicited e-mail, but I can
take that kind of heat.  But if I include a 2,000-word sales pitch for our
products... ;-)

Anyway, I'm looking for a standard way to set aside some example HTML in
messages.  In this list, in particular, it's a common occurence.  In the
HTML 2.0 spec, I see <SAMP> refers to "a sequence of literal characters,"
which would seem to be what we want.  We could easily modify the converter
to do reserved character substitutions for anything enclosed in <SAMP>
tags, but interpret the rest.  Was this the intent of <SAMP>?

As a transition, we can include links to the current "best guess" method
that I'm using now.  We already include links to the original article,
which is just the text wrapped with <PRE>.

Next, we'll get people to put <BLOCKQUOTE> around quoted text... then an
anchor back to the quoted message.  Yeah, that's what we'll do...  Then
we'll have them send us all their money.  ;-)

Not unreasonable, but MIME on www-talk and related mailing lists will
have to wait until the list software is fixed to stop screwing up the
headers.

        I have no reference to that server or its author.
But I like this idea and will see about adding it to the VM server.
Right now I'm working on CGI compliance.   (thanks for the pointers all)

I am developing some www material on cave science, especially Mammoth Cave

year, but have recently added images. I am starting to learn about sensitive 
maps and want to convert our (The Cave Research Foundation's) "open-format" 
ASCII cave survey data into sensitive maps which can be "clicked" upon for 
more infomation including cultural history relating to the specific cave or 
surface feature.
CRF has opened their archives to me, and I really want to impress them.
Thanks for any discussions of sensitive map stuff, although I am too new at 
this to contribute anything....probably shouldn't have posted this.

The 'deceit' web-server does this at the moment: any filename extension
is is ALWAYS ignored, by stripping it off the input URL.  Then the
Accept formats are used to look for the correctly typed object.  In an
original version of the server, it would also use the Accept formats to
attempt a conversion path into the most desired object.  Unfortunately,
without quality info being sent, this could mean that images would be
appearing as ascii-art and so this is no longer enabled in the server.

Check out the "Tangled Web of Deceit" paper from WWW94.

Notes seemed to us like a great idea in search of a marketing department. 
 While everyone else is going towards concurrent-user licensing, Lotus (and 
other document management applications, alas) persist with the strategy of 
"price-per-potential-user".  When projects have around 600+ potential users 
(like ours!), Notes becomes an expensive solution.  Especially for the 
"skunk-works" projects *I* have been working on...

Unless Lotus learns and learns quickly how to market Notes in today's PC 
market rather than the market of early 1980's minicomputer software, Lotus 
Notes will be seen as a seminal effort in PC groupware defeated by marketing 
out-of-tune with the customer base of its day.

Howdy,

I'm just starting to work wih HTTP and have been looking for the protocol
spec. The latest document I can find is an Internet Draft dated 14 July 1993.
Has this been upgraded to an RFC? If so, can someone tell me what number?
If not, is there a more recent document available?

Thanks for any help.

Subject: Script Terminator?
content-length: 1043

Hi!

I have read all of the docs available at hoohoo about CGI under the NSCA
server, but I'm still a little confused...

I'm trying to execute a script that will return via e-mail some information
to an email address that is supplied in a form, but I don't want the user
to have to wait for the script to finish executing before he gets a
response from the server saying "blah blah Your information will be mailed
to you blah blah."

I'm using Perl, I've tried making my pipes hot to no avail--it seems that
the server doesn't give the client anything until the script is done.

I've tried forking a child process to do the analysis and mail the results,
leaving the parent process to report the HTML and terminate, but as soon as
the parent terminates, the server must be killing the shell in which the
child resides because it is terminated immediately too!

I'm not much of a Unix hacker yet, so apologies if this is some Unix trivia
that I need to know.

I'd appreciate any help!

Hi!

I have read all of the postings on Lotus Notes over the last month
both pro and con, but I'm still a little confused...

It seems to me that comparing Notes to WWW/Mosaic is sort of like comparing
trn program to the WWW. I want to make sure that my 
understanding of what's going on is correct as a lot of hype going
around by certain people with vested interests (read Lotus Sales and 
Marketing!!) which is clouding my brain.

Unless organizations understand the difference, we are going to
see a lot of spending on Notes (well most of it already spent) which might 
be money down the drain. It horrifies me when I see organizations buy 
5,000 to 10,000 copies of Notes. (Are you, MIS folks, nuts??) Understand
the technology first seems to be a vanishing philosophy.


First, let us compare Notes and WWW in terms of document architectures. 


i)Notes uses the compound document architecture (CDA) of DEC, 
which is probably the only implementation of Open Document 
Architecture (ODA). CDA attempts to capture the structure of document
using a document application profile (DAP), similar to a template in Notes,
and the layout information and tranform them into a binary bit stream for
the purpose of document interchange between platforms. To do this it
uses the notion of memory aggregates which are encoded bit streams of
what the document contains and looks like. (See Byte 1992 -- Universal 
Content Access for more info.) 


WWW uses the concept of structured documents (separation of 
logical structure from rendering information) popularized by GML 
and later SGML. SGML provides a metalanguage capability for defining
document type definitions (DTD). HTML is a DTD which can be thought as
a specialized language for creating distributed hypertext applications. 
The orientation of HTML is towards document interchange between
platforms + document exchange between various browsers + ability to
customize the document to a variety of output devices (Braille -- Books
for the Blind, different types of terminals -- X to tty based, audio) and
a host of other consumer devices.  


In other words, exchange NOTES is like exchanging binary files, whereas
exchange HTML files is like passing source code around which can be 
customized or even personalized to the environment you are working in 
at that moment. This is a significant step forward that was never envisioned
by the world in 1984-90 timeframe when NOTES was conceptualized and built. 


Another drawback of Notes is that CDA (according to a DEC Professional article)
cannot handle Hypertext links as these would be dropped in the
encoding process. Well, folks this is a major drawback of Notes that puts the 
HTML on a different plane altogether.  


2. Search and Retrieval: Notes can only allow content searching using
bit-pattern matching techniques. It is quite possible to use HTML 
markup to do more sophisticated searches such as sub-tree retrieval,
because every HTML document is a tree, and even other sophisticated 
methods that were developed in compiler theory that we have not 
exploited in this environment.


We can also think of search in terms  hypertext structures. Well I can go
on and on..

My point is that unless Notes does a major rewrite of its software
using SGML as the underlying document format, it is futile and pointless 
to even compare the two.

I would appreciate if someone corrects and enhances my understanding
of what's going on.

Thanks for reading this far,

-- Ravi

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

content-length: 2591

The Dienst draft specifies a much-needed protocol for efficient
electronic publishing. People don't like to retrieve megabytes of
Postscript only to discover that the text is of no use to them.
Dienst's search and page-by-page facilities deserve to be implemented
as soon as possible.

An especially nice feature is that it doesn't require any browser
changes, although a modified browser could offer more functionality.

In view of the above, my comments do not question the concept per se,
but I have some suggestions for changes in the details.

I think the most important change is in the naming of the data types
returned by the Dienst server. In nearly all cases the server returns
data identified as "text/plain" or "text/x-dienst-response", even
though the data is actually in different formats. This requires the
client to analyze the request (URL) in order to interpret the
data. Instead, the server should return distinct types, e.g.:

  "application/dienst-services", or
  "application/dienst; type=services", or even
  "dienst/services".

As far as I can see the following distinct types are returned:

  services  - list of keywords
  time      - date & time as in RFC 1123
  version   - a version number
  contents  - list of bibligraphic records, seperated by an empty line
  search    - idem
  formats   - list of format records, *not* seperated by an empty line
  (plus images and html)

Minor points:

I don't see what is "object oriented" about Dienst.

The example for UISearchIntMethod spells "Search" with a capital "S",
that should be "s".

The prototype implementation seems to use a different URL syntax from
the one given in the text.

One of the "related issues" in section 5 seems to point to distributed
servers ("Server registration"). Exactly how servers should relay
queries to each other is unclear to me. This probably needs additional
mechanisms, not present in the current Dienst protocol.


Regards,
Bert


PS. "Dienst" appears to stand for "Distributed Interactive Extensible
Network Server for Techreports", but I wonder if it is a coincidence
that "dienst" is the Dutch word for "service"?

I'd like to address some of the below, as I think that the Notes vs. WWW 
argument is getting more important.  A caveat -- by business partner is a 
Lotus Certified Notes Specialist and we are Lotus Business Partners.  
However, I am a WWW person approaching Notes, so I can see through some 
of its models, and appreciate some of its strengths.

Comments interspersed below.

There can be multiple representations of the same data, using different 
forms.  Moreover, technologies such as Notes/FX, and tools such as ViP 
and Notes API programs can pick out parts of the information and render 
it in any way you choose.

It appears your point is that the client doesn't have choice like in 
SGML.  That is true -- the decision is made programatically beforehand by 
the provider.  However, as the great publishing debate on www-talk 
several months ago showed, this might be greeted with applause.

See the comments above.  Notes is not like passing around binary data.  
You can use technologies other than today's standard Notes client (i.e. 
ViP, VB/Link, Notes/FX, C API) to extract only the data.  However, your 
point about allowing run-time choices on the client stands.

Notes has DocLinks that can connect to other documents on other databases 
on other servers, in accordance with the Access Control List.

You can comment on the esoterics of indexing theory.  I can say that Notes
_today_ (based on Verity's engine -- Nick?? :^) gives full-text retrieval,
weighted hits, and internal highlights.  Morevoer, it takes about three
mouse clicks to index a database.  Finally, indices can be either
server-side or local (important for the disconected user). 

In another vein, by using structured fields and categories, customized
views can be presented that organize content beforehand.  Full-text
indexing is wrong, IMHO.  Cataloging and classifying lend themselves to
browsing, and tools that simplify this are invaluable.

Which leads to my next point.  It is futile to say that the WWW, as a 
corporate solution, is equivalent to HTML.  Where in the above have you 
mentioned HTTP?  So, some other comments:

1) Name one case of an HTTP server talking to another HTTP server

2) Name one case of a WWW user editing a document, and sending it back to 
the server

3) Name one case of an active object going to the client, capable of
conditionally executing internal or external code, interacting with the
reader, and sending a result to the server

4) Explain how WWW addresses nomadic users, when all of the programmatic
intelligence is on the server (CGI) and there is no model for 
client-server or server-server replication

5) *Today*, Notes has corporate ACL (very robust, point-and-click) with RSA 
security, and the tools to administer it

6) Name one client or server that has implemented the Version attribute in
the HTTP spec, thus allowing revision control

7) Notes can be bought from a Fortune 500 company with a support staff, 
maintenance agreements, a third-party catalog, and contracts with the 
government (I disagree the true importance of any of that, but others 
believe it)

I could name WWW technologies that are addressing all of the above, 
namely Harvest:
	http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/
However, asking an MIS to get twenty pieces written by twenty places, 
that may or may not compile on your platform, and are an absolute *bitch* 
to administer (oh, what even a _curses_ admin interface would do for a 
WWW server administrator), might be asking too much.

Funny, I have come off sounding like a Notes zealot, when the opposite is 
true -- I think that the popular press is beginning to view "Mosaic" 
(snicker) as more than a toy, and a Notes competitor.  Notes is too 
monolithic, and I don't think the Notes 4 rewrite is going to change its 
"paradigm".

Well, that's the end of this spiel.

As far as I know, there are the registerd servers listed in the perl-
scripts of the dienst server software, and so the search is made
on all listed servers from the one which makes the search.

Original URL for dienst: <a href="http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu">
Cornell CS Technical Reports</a>

We also plan to register our university in this CSTR project.

You need to store information which is then used by another process. For example 
writing files, or inserting entries into batch queues, or suchlike. The process 
that deals with this information runs independently of the server. See if you 
have NQS on your system. If not, see if you have the 'at' command.

The current implementation incorporates a "first-cut" at a
meta-server protocol.  A central site (Cornell, at this point)
maintains a registry of existing Dienst servers, other sites
periodically query this site to update their tables.  The current
design is rather primitive but lays the basis for what we'd like to
do in the future.

No coincidence, one of the implementers (Jim Davis) is married to a

Our engine works in Notes as with any other data.  Fundamentally, it's just
a serial stream of words.  The real issue is that general-purpose engines
use a flat document model, while Notes and structured documents don't.
Clearly, everyone in the search business is going to have to support
non-flat models.

Relevancy ranking, which is a component of every serious full-text search
engine, is the *basis* for automation of "categorizing" (more commonly
called profiling).  I don't think we can do away with automated profiling
by assuming that authors and publishers will be able to predict the
taxonomies into which readers will want to place their documents.

News wires have used category tags for more than a decade, but they still
want profiling because one of the ways that one can add value to
information is by matching a classification scheme to the audience.  The
very best results come from manually building a weighted semantic network,
so the tools to manipulate the network wind up being the most important
maintenance tools.

>2) Name one case of a WWW user editing a document, and sending it back to

Interesting that you mention these issues.  When our engine returns a
document through our Web server (from the file system or another gateway it
understands), it adds markup.  Specifically, it creates a "match list" at
the top of the document, linked by named anchors to the first matches.  It
also boldfaces the matches.  Obviously, we could do more.

However, when we index remote documents using our spider, the documents
have to be returned by the HTTP server that "owns" them (our engine is
distributed, we don't keep local copies of documents).  Right now, we just
create a results list with anchors back to the "owning" server.  However,
if we wanted to add the match list, boldface and other markup, we would
have to do exactly what you describe -- our server would retrieve the
document from the "owning" server, mark it up, and pass it to the client.

I think we'll support both models.  The latter one adds latency, but in
some applications, it adds great value.  Imagine, for example, if the
server marked up the document with concept-driven "explain" links to a
glossary/FAQ list.  A publisher could even sell this linking capability as
a service.

We'll probably try this out sometime in the next couple of months with
Web-related information on the upcoming www.verity.com server (the T-1 is
on, the WebMaster is hired, it's only a matter of time now!).

>3) Name one case of an active object going to the client, capable of
>conditionally executing internal or external code, interacting with the
>reader, and sending a result to the server

We have customers who want that capability now.  Imagine a technical
support CD-ROM that the client uses as a local cache to the publisher's Web
server.  When the client does a search, it first explores the CD-ROM to
find information locally, then checks with the server for recent updates.

Virtual sessions, with log-in and log-out.

This is a clear advantage for Notes, with which I think the Web will be
slow to catch up.

I think customers will drive demand for this, too, very quickly.

You don't have to be a huge company to offer those things.  For example,
our customer list includes huge, demanding Fortune 500 businesses and great
big three-letter intelligence agencies, all of who use our tools in
mission-critical applications.  We'll apply our level of support to our Web
products, as well.  I'm sure that others building commercial Web products
will, too.

The bottom line for us is that we're not pursuing an either-or strategy for
Notes or any other information technology, from Notes to HTTP to Z39.50 to
SQL to Acrobat.  We're working on technologies that give customers access
to their information no matter how many ways they store it.

Actually, searching is also one of the strong points for SGML document
system too. Once can usually search for "foo within <bar>", which is a
very nice way to limit the scope of searches. Using much the same
mechanism and stylesheets, one can also define "views" to hide or
display sections of a document.

Just a little note...

Brian Behlendorf (brian@wired.com) pointed out something I didn't 
think about earlier. Notes was meant for GroupWare and many-to-
many interaction to foster better communication in the organization.
A laudable achievement indeed.

WWW is meant for a "Digital Library" or an electronic publishing 
paradigm based on "Open Systems" (yes! I dare to use the term). It
fosters the notion of non-interactive publishing as a method of 
communication.

So, we have twoxtwo matrix here:

            |-----------------------------------------|
            | 	"mucho"	interaction|  Non-interactive |
	    |       dynamic        |   not so dynamic |
            |-----------------------------------------|
Groupware   |   Notes, TRN         |WWW + annotations | 
            |    Mbone             |                  |
            |-----------------------------------------|
Publishing  |  Notes wanna be      |FTP, Gopher, WWW  |
            |-----------------------------------------|
		
So, Notes wants to get a piece of the action in the publishing
world as they see that organizations want the ability to
publish information (product & service information) as way
of interacting with existing or potential customers. Also 
there is a notable trend in organizations towards cross-functional
information sharing that can only be accomplished using a
publishing paradigm with some semblence of document management.
In other words, the movement (socially, organizationlly etc.) is
towards a mixture of WWW paradigm + Groupware paradigm.

Lotus recognizes this trend is desperately trying to reposition
itself in this new environment. I have no complaints about that
as we live in competitive dog-eat-dog environment, with clients,
investors and traders dictating some part of strategy.

Well then what is the argument about? Will the underlying 
technology of Notes implementation support this transition
to publishing in the non-proprietary, multiple-client, multiple
protocol, mutiple-servers having a variety of documents in a
varity of formats. For instance, can we run video documents in Notes as
easily as we in WWW/Mosaic? If the underlying technology changes
we have seen that WWW can adapt very easily because of the design
decisions that were made. Can Notes do the same?

My feeling is that Notes cannot survive in its current form 
given the rapid change of customer requirements, need for 
customizing or tailoring to specific customers and the new
standards, protocols and "convergence" taking place.

This is going to create a legacy so large that it will dwarf even
COBOL. Organizations are putting enormous amounts of documents
in Notes. As we have seen in the past reconversion is not a simple
matter and requires enormous expenditure. My argument in the previous
posting was that if you want to invest in Notes TODAY, think twice.
The world two years from now could be a very different place. If you
are investing mega-dollars in purchasing 5,000 to 10,000 licences then
you should think even harder about transition problems and demand that
Notes address some of these issues. 

I have tried to deal with the issue  of Notes vs. WWW from a conceptual
point of view rather than get mired in specific issues such as
HTML, HTTP, DocLinks etc.

I would love to hear what you think about my assessment. There are
several other things I would like to air my views on but time is
money so,  adios amigos.

There can be multiple representations of the same data, using different 
forms.  Moreover, technologies such as Notes/FX, and tools such as ViP 
and Notes API programs can pick out parts of the information and render 
it in any way you choose.

It appears your point is that the client doesn't have choice like in 
SGML.  That is true -- the decision is made programatically beforehand by 
the provider.  However, as the great publishing debate on www-talk 
several months ago showed, this might be greeted with applause.

See the comments above.  Notes is not like passing around binary data.  
You can use technologies other than today's standard Notes client (i.e. 
ViP, VB/Link, Notes/FX, C API) to extract only the data.  However, your 
point about allowing run-time choices on the client stands.

Notes has DocLinks that can connect to other documents on other databases 
on other servers, in accordance with the Access Control List.

You can comment on the esoterics of indexing theory.  I can say that Notes
_today_ (based on Verity's engine -- Nick?? :^) gives full-text retrieval,
weighted hits, and internal highlights.  Morevoer, it takes about three
mouse clicks to index a database.  Finally, indices can be either
server-side or local (important for the disconected user). 

In another vein, by using structured fields and categories, customized
views can be presented that organize content beforehand.  Full-text
indexing is wrong, IMHO.  Cataloging and classifying lend themselves to
browsing, and tools that simplify this are invaluable.

Which leads to my next point.  It is futile to say that the WWW, as a 
corporate solution, is equivalent to HTML.  Where in the above have you 
mentioned HTTP?  So, some other comments:

1) Name one case of an HTTP server talking to another HTTP server

2) Name one case of a WWW user editing a document, and sending it back to 
the server

3) Name one case of an active object going to the client, capable of
conditionally executing internal or external code, interacting with the
reader, and sending a result to the server

4) Explain how WWW addresses nomadic users, when all of the programmatic
intelligence is on the server (CGI) and there is no model for 
client-server or server-server replication

5) *Today*, Notes has corporate ACL (very robust, point-and-click) with RSA 
security, and the tools to administer it

6) Name one client or server that has implemented the Version attribute in
the HTTP spec, thus allowing revision control

7) Notes can be bought from a Fortune 500 company with a support staff, 
maintenance agreements, a third-party catalog, and contracts with the 
government (I disagree the true importance of any of that, but others 
believe it)

I could name WWW technologies that are addressing all of the above, 
namely Harvest:
	http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/
However, asking an MIS to get twenty pieces written by twenty places, 
that may or may not compile on your platform, and are an absolute *bitch* 
to administer (oh, what even a _curses_ admin interface would do for a 
WWW server administrator), might be asking too much.

Funny, I have come off sounding like a Notes zealot, when the opposite is 
true -- I think that the popular press is beginning to view "Mosaic" 
(snicker) as more than a toy, and a Notes competitor.  Notes is too 
monolithic, and I don't think the Notes 4 rewrite is going to change its 
"paradigm".

Well, that's the end of this spiel.

Does anyone know of an engine that does this yet?  We're talking with some
SGML experts so that we can figure out the right technical strategy and
we're talking with everyone on this list about HTML...

Clearly the potential is tremendous, but the search engines have to have a
document model that mirrors the right aspects of structured text.

FYI, most engines at best just have the notion of "zones" -- phrases,
sentences and paragraphs -- and attributes, which would be fielded
meta-information.  We are designing a generic capability to take header
information from an HTML document and put it into our attribute fields.
I'm digging up the old "META" discussion to see what, if anything, we
decided is a minimal standard.

Now if we just had one more software engineer... ;-)

Check out Harvest:
	http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/

It has a gatherer that uses Essence to do customized extraction.  Lots of 
theory on it, all of which makes me dizzy.  I'm beta testing Harvest now, 
and it is some pretty powerful stuff, with strong indexing, replication, 
caching, etc.

The Harvest system first uses heuristics to determine what the file is -- 
HTML, FAQ, etc. -- then, since it knows about the structure of those 
files, can extract type-specific info.  I'm using it for building in 
bibliographic information using (as you mentioned below) META tags.

It is pretty interesting how Harvest does this.  It makes what is known 
as a SOIF object (like an IAFA template) that summarizes the object.  
Lots of things happen after that, but it allows for sophisticated queries.

I bet TimBL would cry if he heard you say that. Perhaps for some folks
WWW is meant to be a publishing system. But the original WWW client
was also an editor. It did not encourage the producer-consumer model
fostered by Mosaic -- it was much closer to the peer-peer relationship
of USENET.

With the advent of a few tools, the web should once again take on
the collaborative nature that it was meant to from day one.

I remember reading a discussion along the lines of this subject a few
weeks ago.  At the time, there did not seem to be any follow-up suggestions
about how such money-making enterprises can help the non-profit side of
Web development.  Well, here is one.

Several times a year, WWW developers have a chance to get together in person,
meet each other, and discuss many of the ideas and issues which will impact
the Web's development over the coming year.  Examples include the Geneva
WWW94, Chicago WWWF94, and (for those involved in the standards process)
the IETF conferences.  For many businesses, particularly large corporations,
attendance at these conferences is an accepted cost of doing business.

Unfortunately, most WWW developers are volunteers or lowly-paid students --
people who have no expense-accounts and no means to afford a distant
conference trip.  Unless people like us are presenting a paper at
the conference (as I did at WWW94), we are effectively excluded from
the discussions with fellow developers.  Many of the best ideas
are left unspoken and potential collaborations are missed.

I believe that this hurts both businesses and the World-Wide Web as a whole.
Businesses lose an opportunity to speak with the most active Web developers
and, in particular, those who are not worried about competition or guarding
trade secrets.  The WWW as a whole loses because much of Web development,
as well as the standardization process, is a collaborative effort.  Many
collaborations (e.g. the libwww-perl project) had their genesis at one of
these conferences/meetings.

So, what can be done about it?  How about supporting grants for travel-
assistance?  Such could be provided by individual corporations or consortiums,
either to individuals known to be in need or via some application process.
They could also be combined with some other requirement, such as a day's
visit at the benefactor's company.

Now, why would companies want to do this?

  (1) Recruiting!  Companies typically spend far more on random recruitment
      efforts -- this would be a great way to attract hot developers
      without the usual pressure of interviews, etc.

  (2) Enormous goodwill -- how much is it worth to have the developers
      think of you as a benefactor, rather than just a user, of their efforts?

  (3) Knowledge -- these people know a lot about Web technology -- far more
      than has ever been documented by CERN or NCSA -- and many are experts
      at passing knowledge on to others.

It seems to me that this is an ideal opportunity for business to get their
hands in the cookie jar, and have the cook applaud them at the same time.

Harvest has certainly caught our attention here.  It has several
interesting aspects.  But I was really asking about commercial,
general-purpose search engines.  There are a number of research projects
that are working on new document models.  I'm wondering if anything has
made the leap from research to commercial product.

By the way, one of our engineers has pointed out to me that our engine has
hooks that allow the definition of a document to include some structural
info.  That's what the Lotus folks are using to make our engine more
intelligent about how to deal with its compound documents.  The engine is
thus able to search for words occurring in a named region of a Notes
document.

This could obviously apply to HTML documents, at least for searching the
header v. the body... but most everything in the headers these days is more
appropriate to include in our index as attributes rather than in the
full-word index.  If some sort of longer text, such as an abstract, were
often available, then it would make sense for us to add that as a
searchable region in the full-word index.

I'll second that, with another "that's what customers want" tossed in.  The
non participative consumer model is bound to fail in most applications;
it's misplaced faith in the kinds of tools that our company builds.
Software alone isn't good enough to be a useful filter/prioritizer for most
kinds of information, I'd argue.

There's a fundamental truth about people here.  For most subjects, we
decide what's interesting and valuable in the context of a community, not
as individuals.  There may be evolutionary reasons for this, based on the
philosophical notion that the more people who know something, the more
likely it is to be true.  (Studies have rather conclusively demonstrated
that the more people who know something, the faster it can be taught to
others.)

I have no doubt that the most interesting, successful and (dare I say)
profitable broad-based information services on the net will include
"massively parallel wetware" (participation by a community) as one of the
filtering components.  Tools like ours will extend their reach, but I don't
think anyone is even near building software that will eliminate the need
for human opinion leaders.

Mendicant sysops don't have to worry about becoming redundant, I suspect.

Dan points out a popular misperception about WWW - that there is a
directional bias.  Popular usage of the technology may include publishing
but the underlying technology does not implement a "fetch-it" bias.

I'm looking at

In the line:

                                ^^

UR really looks like it should be <uri> or possibly URI.

1. Is this just a bug in the spec?
2. Is this the right place to report such bugs?
3. Is there a more uptodate spec?

How does authentication work across multiple proxied servers?  Can each
server handle authentication independently, or is it confined to the first

Ah! Forwarding of credentials! When I read the HTTP and SHTTP specs,
I found this sorely lacking.

By the way... has anyone out there read the SHTTP spec enough to
understand just how it provides for spontaneous secure transactions?

Supposedly, two parties who have no previous knowledge of each other
can spontaneously begin a secure transaction using SHTTP. I read
that RFC three times, and I couldn't find the trick. I came away feeling
this was some deep RSA voodoo, not to be disclosed without a license.
But the more I think about it, the less I believe it.

Some relevant references:

HTTP:

SHTTP:

I can't seem to find a good reference for Kerberos 4, but I believe
it supports forwarding of credentials.

I haven't read this one, but it looks promising:

I am confused by the above statements. What is a "fetch-it" bias? 

Are you making a distinction between message passing between a 
client(consumer)<->server(producer) (asynchronous
interaction) as opposed to a client<->client, (synchronous interaction)? 

Peer-to-peer interaction is very useful in environments such as engineering,
R&D, problem-solving essentially,  where a dialogue is essential and 
exchange is more like rapid-fire. But it creates anarchy in terms of 
organizational communications as there is not much structure in the process. 

The producer-consumer model is an all pervasive model and it's one
organizations want to see (at least the ones I interacted with)  in 
domains such as technical documentation, sales and marketing information
and transactions with clients and other collaborators (EDI) because it 
gives them control. 

You must remember that CSCW while very popular in terms of research 
with respect to things like collaborative editing etc., has not made
any inroads in terms of organizational applications as there is often
no control or filter on the information posted. The issue is not at a
technological one but more of a social one. 

My point is that we have not even scratched the surface of the 
network publishing model in terms of applications. We can effectively
subsume the on-demand publishing (video on-demand, games on-demand etc.)
applications very easily in this model. And, that is one of the reasons
why it is so popular.   

True that the WWW initially was meant to do other things but we have
to go with what the customer wants or may want in the future.

---------------------------

This is just an opinion, but I think you'll find that both models
(peer to peer and producer to consumer) are in demand, both by different
people having different objectives and also by the same people in different
contexts.  The net is by definition not limited to producer-consumer
relations; I think this is one reason it is popular; the consumer can
also produce and talk back.  Granted, large organizations want control
of their assets, communications and image.  Individuals also want control
often for the same reasons.  Beyond the ability of a large organization
being able to exercise control over its online information, presence and
communications, you'll also find areas where such isn't very important
and the emphasis is on individual contribution and/or collaboration.

Whoa whoa - I said that's the unfortunate circumstance we're in now.
I *know* (from looking at all the unimplemented parts of the HTTP and 
HTML specs) that wasn't the original intention, and a large part of our 
development efforts should be to return to those goals.  As it turned out 
the biggest attraction for WWW applications was as a pretty hypertext
replacement for the information function gopher performed.  Now that we 
know it can do that well, let's take it to the next level.

Don't ignore the cross-platform element... in my view cross-platform 
support is one of the biggest selling points of the WWW.  For example, 
we now have a slew of SGI's here at Wired, instead of just the one I 
used.  Now the new people using the SGI's don't have Now Contact, the 
calendar program everyone (but me) was using to synchronize everyone's 
activities.  We haven't found a calendar product we could use together on 
both platforms.  However, I could probably code together in 3 days a 
rudimentary WWW internal application that did the same thing - and since 
we have WWW browsers on both platforms that have forms support, we can
use that same app (mostly) identically on both systems.  This is a small 
example of a big benefit of WWW technology - it was designed to be 
lightweight enough and flexible enough to perform masterfully on 
terminals and on high-end workstations.

I think this is true of any large single-vendor system that tries to "do 
it all"... I think that's a dying softare paradigm, and the 
"mix-and-match" model is becoming more robust than any corporate types 
thought it would.  The glue for mix-and-match is in the protocols - those 
*must* be strong and universally supported for this to happen.  And many 
companies have successfully operated within that model and thrived 
(Cygnus, for example).

Or maybe it's because half the bounces on the mailing lists I run are 
from "user@notes.company.com" :)

A problem that has social and technical solutions.  A lack of structure 
is a good starting place, because one can build tools to manage it.

Filtering filtering filtering.... keep repeating it... filtering 
filtering filtering....  this is a big gaping problem just waiting to be 
solved.  Information filtering is *very* rudimentary currently - you rely 
on a friend to forward you anything interesting from News of the Weird, 
for example, while he trusts you to forward anything interesting from 
comp.unix.admin.  There are whole mailing lists based on people trusting
other people's opinions - like the David Farber's "interesting-people" 
list, or Peter Neumann's comp.risks.  We are going to see a *torrent* of 
information spilling out onto the web over the next year, and resource 
discovery algorithms based solely on the statistics of the words in 
documents is only one part of the solution.

We need a *generalized*, *secure* way of enabling all internet users to 
become information filters for other users for any given WWW resource.

This is a *technological and social* problem, which will lead to a 
combined technological and social solution.

'Nuff said.

Check out http://www.xerox.com/PARC/dlbx/filtering.html for some more 
thoughts on this issue.

Video on demand is dead.  500 channels isn't it.  It's one big 
asynchronous pipe.  The media doesn't understand asynchronicity.  Yet.

Subject: Re: Authentication across multiple proxied servers
content-length: 1727


Just to add my h'apeth. The docs on Shen are at:-

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html


Shen will be distributed as part of libwww. There will be 
multiple distributions though since some of the encryption algs 
are restricted.


Going through proxies should work, however it needs testing out, I
still having problems with big/little endian machines at the moment.
I will be adding the proxy tests to the regression library as soon
as I get the DecStation (little endian)code to work.


On the key distribution front. I think we need a portable standalone
certificate in a readable form. PEM certificates are not very user
friendly. I want something of the form:-

Originator-ID: w30/security/hallam
Uncertified-Key: RSA,ASWEGQ$W#TYqweuhrgqjh3g47524dsfghf2345c765===
MIC-Head: RSA,RSA-MD5,qw4uyt@AC#%Y*bcwagaw3jk23cb5iuyejhgcwaety ===


Ie keep it transparent and simple. This allows a few more games to be
played. Lets consider adding a second format for POSTing a form based
on the RFC-822 format headers. The result is an ascii `certificate' which
is readable. It can be signed as a separate operation to produce an object
that can be stored conveniently, sent to a third party for authentication
etc.

[yes the tags all need lots of work to make them sensible...]


I don't like the way that PEM tries to make everything opaque by sealing it in
ASN.1 UUencoded forms. Even the originator Id which is an ascii object gets
this treatment. If we want to use ASN.1 I would prefer to develop a variant
HTTP-A that was all ASN.1. Its not a big job actually since we can retarget
the synth for the MIME parser once we get the new parser integrated.

Do you mean URL? the only URI that I know of is Upper Respretory Infection...

For my part, I'm working on this problem with the Webmaster's Starter Kit
(http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/doc, in prerelease).  One place to look, no compiling,
automated configuration, forms-based interfaces for everything.  Could use
some hardening and more admin tools, but I'm working on it.

But anarchy can be *good* when people are faced with overwhelming amounts
of information.  Anarchy allows communities of interest to spring into
life, merge, divide, etc., without being stifled by bureaucracies.  For the
on-line equivalent of talking in the hallways at a conference, where a
great of information is exchanged, anarchy is appropriate.

One problem with Usenet and even more with commercial forums like
CompuServe's, is that it's so hard to create, change and destroy such
communities.  Actually, the appropriate syntax should be that the system
should allow communities to forum, mutate and die.  If defunct Usenet
groups would just roll over and die, that would help...

>The producer-consumer model is an all pervasive model

Yeah, and that's one of the things that's seriously out of whack in our
society, I'd argue.  That's why I compare our times to late medieval
Europe, when the church enforced the "producer-consumer model," as you say.
The printing press and paper changed the situation then; the personal
computer and digital network are changing it now.

I'm not advocating anarchy as a *replacement* for the dominant model, only
as a balance for it.

Small data point -- no one has demonstrated that video-on-demand or
games-on-demand will succeed.  The only place that VOD works now is in
hotel rooms, but I supposed almost anyone will use it if you put them in a
strange city with nothing to do and no VCR.  ;-)

Hi, 
 
	What if finger gateways were sophisticated enough to wrap 
the various fields they return in specific tags?   I mean,  if you 
finger  troth@is.rice.edu,  you'll get (partially) 
 
	    Login name: troth		In real life: Rick Troth
 
	and a typical finger-to-HTML gateway might wrap that in 
 
	    <pre>Login name: troth   In real life: Rick Troth</pre> 
 
	What if in addition there were specific tags for  login_name 
and  in_real_life.   What should those tags be?   I can imagine 
 
	    Login name: <USER_LOGIN_NAME>troth</USER_LOGIN_NAME> 
		    In real life: <USER_PERSONAL_NAME>Rick Troth
			    </USER_PERSONAL_NAME> 
 
	but those are a bit more verbose than I'd like to get. 
 
	There are  *numerous*  other directory service values that 
might also be included.   I guess we aren't up to taking on X.500,  eh? 
Seriously,  though,  this is something that I'd like to include in *my* 
finger gateway,  and I'd like to keep in step with everyone else. 
 
	Any self respecting WWW browser should quietly ignore tags 
that it doesn't recognize.   This gives us a nice migration path for 
future browsers/clients that might actually use this information. 
It would surely help user administration at *this* site.

Yes...

For now, I suppose this is as good a place as any. Lord help us if the
situation doesn't improve soon.

Sadly, no. The spec is maintained by TimBL and the folks at CERN in
their "copious spare time," with input from folks like Tony Sanders
<sanders@bsdi.com>, Rob McCool <???>, Kevin Altsis, Ari, Henrick, and
others that I can't recall just now.

You must have caught all these guys in a bad mood or on vacation.
Generally, they pipe in with answers about the HTTP spec.

If you'd like to volunteer to bring the spec up to date, you would
be doing a great service to the community.

Since the finger protocol doesn't specify much of anything about what
the format of the response should be, any such conversion by a gateway
would have to be heuristic and not necessarily portable to other finger
servers.  In general, it's probably better to convert to a real directory
service for this kind of thing and leave finger for it's current use.

I think the bureaucracies have been beaten up too much. It didn't 
actually spring up overnight but took years of evolution. Whether it
will disappear like the dinosour remains to be seen. But, given
the track record of re-engineering, downsizing, TQM, quality circles,
teams, cross-functional teams and other numerous Harvard Business Review
buzz-words I still think that producer-consumer model will survive, may
be not in the static sense of today but more interactive models will
be developed. (and this is the point all of us are trying to make in our
own various postings). 

For instance, I currently working on an advertising model
for start-up firms on the Internet with a Chicago agency. As we were developing
the model we found that we can do things with/in the Internet 
environment that are revolutionary not only in terms of ads but sales,
marketing functions. To give an example, you can have real-time 
infomercials with a Mbone pipe accessible through a WWW interface. Could
you think of the potential of this environment, say in the medicine, where
before buying a product I actually see a doctor use it and even interact
with the doctor. Now think, not of one doctor but several doctors all
over the world say in India, South Africa, South America all accessible
for interaction so I can learn how the product "behaves" in different 
environments. This is no longer an ad but an education in tune with the
Internet culture.  

That is just one example, of the producer-consumer model with enhancements
for additional interactivity. The potential is just incredible for
organizations to reach customers and get close to them (relationship
marketing).

Another producer-consumer model that is being explored is the 
notion of product catalogs as seen with the NIPDE initiative. 
Here the information related to electronic components 
-- logic, schematics, timing, thermal, placement, parametric etc. --
are integrated with other info. such as Purchasing, Legal/contractual,
customer service etc. The interesting question that needs to be explored
is how does this published on the WWW influence the actual processes
internal to the organization. Does my getting purchasing information
faster make comparision shopping easier? Maybe or may not be if there are
too many alternatives. 

My point is that, we ain't seen nothing yet even in terms of 
producer-consumer (interactive or non-interactive) yet. So critiques of 
it with respect to our pre-WWW ways of thinking don't hold much
water.

My earlier point about on-demand publishing still stands. I must
add that my examples are a little out of whack. VOD,GOD are small data
points in terms of on-demand publishing applications.

	I can live with that. 
 
	So,  again,  what tags should we use?   What do we want it to 
look like when we convert the info from  your_favourite_directory_engine 
to HTML/SGML?

NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows Version 2.0alpha7 is now available on our
NEW ftp server, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  NCSA Mosaic is a network navigational 
tool that will allow you to easily access networked information with the 
click of a button.  Mosaic is capable of accessing data via protocols such 
as HTTP, Gopher, FTP and NNTP (Usenet News) natively, and other data services 
such as Archie, WAIS, and Veronica through gateways.  NCSA Mosaic was designed 
to provide its user transparent and seamless access to these information 
sources and services. With our latest compile we have created a native 
version of Mosaic for the iX86 and the Mips processors.  We still have a 
native DEC aXp version but it dates back to alpha 5.  We will release a 
native DEC version of A7 as soon as we solve our compilier blues.

Below are the naming schemes we will be using for this release.   

	wmos20A7.zip  		->   Win3.1, WWG & NT (iX86 processor)  
	decmosA5.zip  		->   NT on the DECpc (alpha processor)
	MipsMosaic2A7.zip	->   NT for the MipsPC


Bug Fixes

- Local files are no longer deleted.
- Local files are no longer duplicated.
- file:// = ftp://  (Alpha 6 locked file:// for local files and ftp:// 
  for remote files.  However, due to the large number of existing files 
  that were written using the old definition of file://, we had to revert 
  back to file:// = ftp://.  Thus, file:///c| MUST be used to access local 
  files.)
- Image alignment problem.  Inline images align horizontally.
- The -i option was fixed.  (-i allows the user to use the mosaic.ini that 
  is explicitly defined.  ie.  mosaic.exe -i c:\ncsa\mosaic.ini)

Added Features

- The save, save as function.  Save and Save as will save the current 
  document to your local disk.
- Animated Icon Change.  We've changed the size of the icon to be relative to 
  the amount of space that is available in the window.   ie.  If you use both 
  the tool bar and the Show Current URL functions,  you will have a full-size 
  animated icon.   If you choose not to use either of these functions, the 
  icon will be reduced in size to fit in the available space.
- Tool tips were added.  Tool tips offers the user information about the 
  current tool the mouse cursor is pointing at in the Tool bar.
- The find icon on the Tool bar has changed from the list icon to a binocular 
  icon.
- We've removed the "URL" title from the "Show Current URL"




Version 2.0alpha7 is available through our home page,

	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/HomePage.html

or from our anonymous FTP server, "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu".  You can find the
software in the /PC/Windows/Mosaic directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

			    GENERAL INFORMATION
			    ===================
- Documentation for Mosaic DOES exist.  You can find it online via the
"Documentation" link on our home page.  We have also made these html files 
available from our anonymous ftp server, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  You can find 
the file mosdocA5.zip in the /PC/Windows/Mosaic/Document directory.  


- Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups Users

Before you begin, make sure you are using v1.1.5a of the Win32s software.  It 
is available from Microsoft's anonymous ftp server and you can find the file 
Win32s115a.Zip in the /developr/win32dk/sdk-public directory.    For the 
convienence of our users we also mirror a copy of this software on our ftp 
site, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  However, we have added a readme file and we've 
re-zipped it into a file called win32s.zip.  You can find win32s.zip in the
/PC/Windows/Mosaic/ directory of our anonymous ftp server.  	
 
 *******  WIN32S v1.1.5a MUST BE INSTALLED BEFORE YOU RUN Alpha 7  *******
                                                                      

- NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows is a WinSock client program.  It requires
network (TCP/IP) access through the WinSock DLL interface.  If you are using
Windows NT, this is built in. If you are using Windows 3.1, you need to
obtain a WinSock and install it on your system.  If you are running a
commercial TCP/IP stack, such as FTP Software, Novell, PCNFS, etc., you
will need to obtain that vendors winsock.dll.  If you need a winsock.dll and
you would like to obtain a shareware product called the "Trumpet Software 
International Winsock", you can find the latest version at ftp site, 
ftp.utas.edu.au.  The file winsock.zip is in the pc/trumpet/winsock directory.


- Your comments on NCSA Mosaic are important; user feedback is an
integral part of the Software Development Group's (SDG's) planning
activities.  Bug reports are particularly valuable because SDG's tests
cannot duplicate all user environments and equipment configurations.
Bug reports should include enough information to enable SDG developers 
to reproduce the problem.  Please specify any information given by Mosaic, 
and give us a URL so we can try to reproduce the problem.  However, before 
you send any bug reports, comments, or suggestions, please check our on line 
information to ensure your information has not already been reported.  This 
will be very helpful to us because we are swamped with email.  You can find
on line information about known bugs, enhancement requests, FAQ's, viewers,
etc. from our home page.

        I wasn't sure quite what to make of that "!".   There are several
good C compilers for CMS,  but lately I've tried to do things more "native".
For CMS Gopher,  I used REXX and Pipelines instead of C.   It seems to have
worked out nicely.

        Pure UNIXisms really don't apply to a lot of VM or CMS.
You're dealing with one real machine that looks like a bunch of machines.
Like as if each user has his own computer with its own disks.   So some
concepts like home directories are ... well ... they work,  but they
have to be handled differently by the server.   You  DO HAVE  a home,
but it's a disk,  not a directory.

        As I hinted before,  I'm trying to make the VM HTTP server
CGI compliant.   That's the next step for it,  but between having a
real life and keeping a real job  (I'm a UNIX-only sysadmin at Rice)
it's getting tough to find time for these mainframe projects.
People who do VM tend to fall in love with it,  kinda like people
used to fall in love with UNIX.

That way clients can add value to the interface to that protocol.

Overloading gopher: is absolutely the *wrong* solution to the problem.

This isn't wholly true (for all interfaces).  E.g., you still need at
least a face server (something I would like to see happen) for the client
to access if you want to have that type of interface (and I do :).  Using
the "finger gateway" model the interface is defered to the server doing
the work so you get that for "free" (not to mention the ability to support
different kinds of finger interfaces from all clients and eventually things
like language and format negotiation).

I would vote for a finger: protocol setup such that the clients could
"punt" to a finger gateway (via something like a WWW-FINGER-PROXY
environment setting) if they didn't want to implement the protocol.

Talk to the Andrew Consortium guys at CMU who have a nice edit view for
the ez editor (X Window System).  We have a couple of programmers who
are developing a new version of htmltext which is a little rough around
the edges, but it works.  You can also easily expose the HTML tags and
edit them raw if necessary.  The guy to talk to is Fred Hansen

There are certainly some changes we could wish for.  We will mention
some of them at the forthcoming WWW conf in Chicago.

I am not sure I see the value in this.  The client knows what request
it has sent, so it should also know the format of the expected response.
So the client would not gain anything by having the format explicitly
typed.  A second reason, not as strong, but still valid, is that it's
helpful in debugging to have all responses be in some kind of text.
Since I'm returning text, I might as well label it as text. 

The only reason for text/x-dienst-response is that we'd like to be
able to switch to URCs, if that's possible, since they seem to 
intended for closely similar purposes.

> I don't see what is "object oriented" about Dienst.

I like to think of Dienst requests as being messages to documents,
e.g. one asks a document what formats it is in, or what pieces it has,
or for it to print itself.  I'd also like to leave room for future
expansion, so that different documents could respond to messages
in different ways.

True.  The protocol we proposed in the Draft is (we hope) an 
improvement over the one we use in the current working version.  Several
people have been kind enough to criticise the current version, and 
therefore we tried to improve it in the version we propose in the draft.

We have a mechanism in place that is little better than a hack.  One
central server keeps a list of all known Dienst servers, and can
return it on request.  All other servers poll the central site periodically
to get the new list.  To add a new site, someone must edit the central
file.  This will certainly not scale, but it should suffice for the nonce.

Ooops.  You're right.  I made up the acronym after choosing the name.

Hi


Some day ago I read a mail about the conversion of HTML documents
to Postscript; I haven't had the time to answer then, and now I can't
dig the mail stack to look for it. 
This summer I wrote a tool that tries to do such a conversion.
I wrote it during this summer holidays trying to learn a bit more
about the WWW. Now I've brought all the 
stuff on my office's HP to have a printed copy of some CERN's html 
document that I want to study.

So if You are reading this mail and You're still interested in this 
topic, You may browse some test files from

hp835.mt.asi.it/DATA/INFO/htpsdemo.tar

If You'll find useful that kind of results please send me a mail so I'll
put some kind of warning (NO WARRANTY, as is, your own risk ...) fix 
some bug and You'd try to use it. Consider that the sw is a
bit flimsy I haven't had the time to test everything. 


The test cases are wild runs on

Cern home page
html standard doc from www.hal.com 
NCSA mosaic demo document
hot and cool  from kzsu.stanford.edu 
Tank girl WWW
the  html nightmare from www.sunet.se

Please note that I've tested the sw only on an HP AX and with a 
Digital PS printer.

Cheers

Subject: holding connections open: a modest proposal
content-length: 2008

There has been some discussion here about keeping connections open
between client and server after a transaction is complete.  I don't
recall seeing a resolution, however, so I want to put forth what I
think is a simple solution, and I don't recall seeing anything
comparable proposed.

What's New:
1) A server keeps the connection to the client live after a transaction
(e.g., GET).
2) A client sends a QUIT command (like FTP clients) when it wants to
close a connection.  Otherwise it keeps its connection to the server
open at the end of a transaction.

How it's used:
A client explicitly closes a connection by sending QUIT to the server.
Thus, a client that gets a WWW page can scan it for IMGs and issue new
GETs on the original connection, assuming the IMGs come from the same
server.  (Otherwise, the client closes the connection and opens a new
one to the host with the IMG.)  When the client finishes the page and
finds no more IMGs, it sends a QUIT, then closes the connection.

Compatibility:
Conversations between QUIT-capable clients and servers follow the
protocol above and (presumably) work more efficiently.  Conversations
between non-QUIT-capable clients and servers do what they do now.

When a QUIT-capable client talks to a non-QUIT capable server, it will
experience an unexpected close of the connection -- what the server does
now.  It will simply know to create a new connection if it needs further
information from that server.

When a non-QUIT-capable client talks to a QUIT-capable server, the
server will experience an unexpected close while it awaits a command.
The server treats that like an implicit QUIT.  The server times out if
it fails to get a new command "soon enough".

I believe this proposal is straightforward to implement in both clients
and servers.  Because QUIT- and non-QUIT-capable clients and servers can
interoperate, clients and servers can be upgraded as quickly as practical
once folks agree this is worth doing.

We need some resolution on the entire tagging/META issue fairly soon.  Our
engine creates indexes that include document attributes, which typically
are things like author, date created, etc.  Our spider will extract some of
them from the HTTP header, but it's also going to look in the HTML header.
We are going to have to commit to some baseline specification very, very
soon.  One of our short-term goals, for example, is to build a searchable
"virtual library" of documents on the Web that deal with the Web,
publishing and libraries.  We'd like to be able to tell the owners of their
pages how to put tags into their headers so that our spider (and others)
can gather the attributes.  And we'll be doing that with our own documents,
too.

I wouldn't want to do anything that would be un-SGML-ish, but I'd also like
to build a basic structure that won't rule out semantic and relational data
models and cross-industry standards such as MARC.

The momentum will take a bit of a leap on Tuesday, I suspect, when we'll be
making an announcement with Mosaic Communications.

While I know of no careful study I think there is considerable
anecdotal evidence (well at least folklore) that holding the
connection open is a bad idea.  It may reduce network traffic but
increases the load on the server.  For example, I think one of the big
Mac software archives started requesting that people download from
them using gopher instead of ftp because they could serve many times
the number of gopher clients as ftp clients with the same hardware.
The only significant difference is that ftp holds open the connection
and thus consumes server resources while the client user browses the
archives.  This turns out to be costly.

An alternate proposal that would gain most of the network benefits
would be an MGET method in HTTP.  This would require two connections
to download a document containing, say 20 images which is not as
good as 1, I know, but it would reduce load on the server rather
than increase it.   It would also be vey easy to implement
in servers and browsers.

Another proposal which has been discussed is to use MIME multi-part
document format to make an HTML document with 20 images into a 
single document.  The problem with this is that it represents 
substantial effort on the part of browser and server writers and
is, for that reason, not likely to get implemented.

On the www-speed alias we discussed this a couple of months ago.  One 
of the  (simple) solutions we came up with was suggested by Gary Adams. 
 He suggested adding a Pragma: Keep-connection header.  The behaviour 
goes something like:

1) Client sends "Pragma: Keep-connection\n" along with the rest of the headers.
2) If the server supports this pragma, in the reply headers to the 
client, it includes "Pragma: Keep-connection\n" (real protocol negotition)

At this point, either party can terminate the connection.  Generally, 
the client will terminate the connection after it has retrieved all of 
the pieces of the document being viewed (suggested behaviour) or the 
server will terminate the connection based on inactivity by the client 
or server load.

Code changes to support this on both the server and the client are very 
minimal.

We tended to stay away from MGET (as valuable as it may be) or other 
new methods as those should really be part of the next HTTP definition. 
 The Keep-connection pragma allows good interop with virtually no 
changes to clients while addressing the basic problem of numerous 
session setups retrieving a single document.  I think some people are 
working on reference implementations now.

I haven't seen any complete digests of the www-speed alias.  Can 
somebody give a pointer?

However, this approach might have other benefits - 
Allowing Content-Type: multipart to be returned could allow:

A way to generically inline images and other objects without extending
HTML with more <IMG> like tags for other types. If the type is not 
understood, a marker should be displayed by the browser. 
( Problem: how not to send things that the browser doesn't understand. 
  If each part has to be parsed and type-checked, this might eliminate
  of the advantage of using multipart. ) 
[ With browser support, this could allow sending audio parts 1,2,3,4, 
etc. and start playing part 1 while the rest are being transferred, 
automatically playing them in sequence. ] 

text/html and text/plain could be alternated, allowing a simple 
way of inserting text without having to filter and escape characters 
first. 

Allow multipart/parallel audio|image and video. Semantics are that
they are intended to be presented together. ( within the "best effort"
of the client. ) 

[ Functionality of multipart/alternative is already in the client-server
  negotiation, so support would be redundant. ] 


All of which would, I think, take minimal effort on the server to
implement, but WOULD take a substantial effort for clients to support.

In a closely related event, today we are demonstrating search and retrieval
of Adobe Acrobat files via the Web at Adobe's roll-out of Acrobat 2.0
(which has our engine built into it).  We're showing that with a browser
and our Web server (an unannounced product), you can search Acrobat
documents, then spawn the Acrobat viewer for the returned pages.  This
wouldn't be very interesting, I suppose, except that the same searches can
include other kinds of documents on distributed servers, too.

So, one could use the Acrobat Distiller, as I think it's called, to convert
HTML pages to Acrobat, which is more or less display PostScript...

I recall the issue of empty anchors having been discussed some time
ago but I don't remember the conclusions if any.

The problem is that named anchors like 

	<a name="something"></a>

do not work in some well known browsers.  It is necessary to
have some text between the <a name..> and the </a>.  There are
situations when this is not very convenient.

I have several questions:

1.  Is the empty anchor legal HTML?

2.  If so is it a bug in Mosaic or libwww that causes it to fail?
    Will it be fixed?

3.  Is <a name="something"> alone legal, i.e. without the </a> ?


I ask #3 because it seems illegal to me, but I notice it being
used quite commonly because it does work and has the desired effect.

I guess the point is that there is a need for the empty anchor.
If it isn't allowed or is broken and some illegal construct
works then we will have a lot of bad HTML out there.

I was too vague.  While I proposed having the server keep open the
connection, I did not mean for that to be indefinite, or even long.
Pick a satisfactory round-trip delay, increase it to account for
client-side processing, and use that as the length of time for the
server to retain the connection.  That should reduce the risk of
exorbitantly wasted network resources.

Note that the TCP close/wait period takes on the order of minutes.  If
images could be transferred over an already open connection, there
would be fewer connections in close/wait state, and a net saving of
network resources.

I agree this accomplishes much the same thing.  However, the transition
is messier, because MGET-capable and non-MGET-capable components don't
interoperate very well.  With my proposal, older versions of softer can
operate successfully with new.

Right.  It's also a bit harder for the person creating WWW pages
(assuming it's done by hand, which it frequently is).

Re the original proposal, the main thing missing is specification of
headers; the "Content-Length" header becomes mandatory whenever it is
nonzero if multiple transactions are happening.

For that matter, the general semantics of headers becomes a bit less
clear.  Should request headers be re-transmitted by the client with
each request or be assumed by the server to remain the same from
request to request, for instance?  Which ones?

John Franks said:

Actually, I thought the idea was more to improve performance than to
reduce network traffic.  But, in any case, it would be nice to know in
some empirical fashion that this change actually will produce
significant performance gains and will not increase server load.

It also provides extensions that are rather stream-centric.  Up to
this point HTTP generally has not been like that.  Should it be?

Indeed; it also produces some flexibility problems, since the
server has no way of knowing whether the client already has some of
the images cached, or even whether the client can or wishes to
retrieve and display the images at all.

	While I know of no careful study I think there is considerable
	anecdotal evidence (well at least folklore) that holding the
	connection open is a bad idea.  It may reduce network traffic but
	increases the load on the server.  

We should distinguish between two ways of holding a connection open.
One is what ftp does, holding it open for some large amount of time,
on the order of minutes, so the user can figure out what to do next.
The other is holding it open for a short time, on the order of
seconds, so clients and fast users can figure out what additional
documents to get.

Not holding connections open also increases load on the server since
the overhead of opening and closing connections counts for something.
Somewhere in the middle is the optimum setting.  The amount of time
that a server holds a connection open could be automatically adjusted
based on load; it should not drop the threshold any lower or raise it
any higher than the point at which it would increase load on itself if
it did so.

A well behaved client would close the connection when it was idle.
We probably need to figure the heuristics, but as a first cut I would
suggest dropping the connection between each document fetch -- i.e. a
single connection would be used to catch all the embedded images and
such.

The main overhead on the server due to connections being left open
is table space and the cpu time to search through the larger set of
TCP connection blocks.  (Many implementations are brain-dead and use
sequential searches.)

There is a hidden cost to dropping connections -- that of the two
minute TCP TIME-WAIT state.  In other words, when a connection is
closed the TCP engine must hold a control block for two minutes.
In the current mode, this means that servers can end up with a lot of
TIME-WAIT control blocks which burden the CPU by increasing the cost
of finding TCP control context.

People have mentioned the cost of TCP keepalives.  The RFCs require
that they happen no more often, if at all, every two hours.  That's a
pretty light load.

Yes.  The one tricky part for the client using "Pragma: 
Keep-connection" is that the server may close the connection right 
after the client has made its next request but before the server has 
received the request.

The solution here is the client sees the connection was closed and if 
the pragma was being used, they should simply do the request again 
(open the connection and make the request like they would have w/o the 
pragma), otherwise error out to the user like normal.

I think similar solutions have been discussed, although early enough on in the 
Webs history that they might not show up on www-talk archives.

Briefly, keeping the connection open requires the server to commit resources 
until timeout or explicit quit, reducing the number of connections that can be 
made at one time and reducing the throughput. On the other hand, making lots of 
connections to get tiny files incurrs significant overhead in establishing 
connections.

Exactly.

These have been proposed before, certainly by me, and I got the impression even 
then that this was not considered novel ;-). I suggested that a client that had 
retrieved a document containing 20 images all from the same site should send a 
list of the images it wanted [ problems with specifying such a list] and get 
them back in a MIME multipart. The server would need to specify in its accept 
headers that it could handle multipart [problems with some existing clients 
sending */* in the accept header] and the client would unpack all the images.

Advantage is that text only clients or clients with inline images turned off for 
selective retrieval do not have to get all the images then throw them away, as 
they would with a single multipart containing text plus images in John's 
suggestion.

Problems were many:

1) Either the server has these multiparts all made up, in addition to the 
individual files for non-multipart-capable clients  [extra storage, extra set-up 
complexity when establishing a server] or makes them on the fly when asked [ 
extra processing load on servers] possiblky cacheing them [but see below]

2) The client may have _some_ of these images already in its cache. So the multi 
get request would be different each time from each client, requesting a subset 
of the images in the document. This tends to rule out pre-generated multiparts 
on the server.

3) There may be (a chain of) cacheing proxies between client and server. Suppose 
our 20 image document has been retrieved. The client already has images 1, 3 and 
5 so sends a multiget for the rest. The first proxy has images 2, 7 and 12, plus 
14 except that just expired so the proxy would have to do a conditional GET on 
14 to get the most up to date version if it has changed. The proxy must parse 
the multiget list from the client, edit the request for 2 7 and 12, forward on a 
request for the others.

So the client gets: 

1, 3, 5 from its internal cache
4, 6, 8..11, 13, 15..20 from the server via the proxy, as a multipart
2, 7, 12, 14 from the proxy, perhaps as a multipart [extra proxy processing]

And the server receives a conditional get from the proxy for 14, which incurrs 
an additional connection delay and may result in 14 being sent singly from 
server to proxy.

Add a couple more proxies in the chain and it seems like it isnt such a big win 
anymore, and is rapidly getting complex.

Indeed, unless the wins are great enough.

An alternative approach is to reduce the slow start connection time, use a 
different protocol than HTTP, etc. I believe this is discussed on www-speed 
[corrections if I am wrong please]

My intent was to treat each follow-up GET as a new transaction.

I think people have gotten too bogged down in the minutiae of my proposal.
The big picture is for clients and servers to behave as they do now, except
that instead of closing the client-server connection, leave it open (a
SHORT time) to see if another transaction between the same parties will
follow.  The SHORT time is enough to allow the client to decide to download
images (typically) and make a new GET request, just as it would do now.
Unlike now, there would be an open connection on which to do it, so the
setup time for a connection (and the tear-down time for the previous one)
are saved.

Larry Masinter <masinter@parc.xerox.com> says:
  > Aren't there possible race conditions, where the server decides to
  > shut down the connection just as the client sends the second GET?

Indeed.  The only race condition of interest is where the client starts
a new request just as the server is shutting down the connection.  But
because the proposal I put forth essentially reverts to current
behavior (open a new connection, make a request, etc.) on a dropped
connection, the recovery method is hardly more burdensome than what
happens now.


I want to emphasize again that I have in mind a SMALL change.  The
reason is simple.  With this small change we can make evolutionary
changes to the components we have, without introducing a stage where
old versions of a client or server can't talk to the new versions.
Other proposals (except Pragma: Keep-connection; I guess my proposal is
equivalent to an implicit Pragma:  Keep-connection.), however
sophisticated (and complicated), introduce incompatibities, and are
therefore less desirable.

Our internal document repository allows users to edit their documents and 
send them back to the server.  It required about 1000 lines of Perl (which 
will drop by 25-50% or so in my next revision :)) and 100 actual lines or so 
of Visual C++ (but the number of automatically generated lines!...).  It 
supports versioning of documents, with automatic retrieval of old versions 
coming as soon as I have time to write the simple CGI script.  I wouldn't 
even have needed the Visual C++ except for the lack of a "submit this whole 
file" widget in Microsoft Windows WWW browsers.

As another example, at TCE we have a mixture of systems here that is not 
likely to change in the next few years.  My main internal clients are 
engineers with MS Windows PCs, but there are departments with MacIntoshs and 
much of our internal ISO efforts are spent on VM and CICS applications for 
sales and marketing.  Lotus has been so incredibly tardy with its 
cross-platform support that it is not even funny, just pathetic.

<flame>

Lotus Notes is the Procrustean solution -- up until recently, it was "you 
will run an OS/2 Lotus Notes server and OS/2 and MS Windows clients UND YOU 
VILL LIKE IT!" like Nazis in grade-Z movies.  Never mind that you may have 
all Windows and Windows NT or all Sun systems (both representative of 
departments at TCE).

Don't even get me started on Notes' "potential-user licensing" versus the 
almost uniform change in the software industry for office automation 
applications to "concurrent-user licensing" (email is the one notable 
exception to this, IMHO).  My guess is that Lotus' antiquated pricing 
policies has shut them out of anywhere from 25% to 400% additional business.

</flame>

The greatest gains in productivity I have seen came from componentizing 
software enough that individual pieces could be:
a) Substituted by improved versions; and
b) Put together in ways their makers never intended.  ("If you cannot think 
of three ways to abuse a tool, you do not understand how to use it." - 
Stewart Brand?).
One reason UNIX became so popular among software people is that the text 
processing programs could be combined to do all sorts of things not 
necessarily forseen by their authors.  VBXes in the MS Windows world have 
become popular for similar reasons, allowing software designers to drop a 
widget into a GUI application, customize it by changing some property 
fields, thereby adding (for example) a spreadsheet interface to their 
relational database application.  Because of Notes current monolithic 
structure, it will have to be rewritten or it will be overtaken by software 
designed as collections of components at the start.

This is true, one can architecture servers such that things like file
handle limits do not apply, but there is still an increase in CPU
usage when connections are left open. I have never measured the
different loads, but I would guess that the overhead of having open
connections, and the overhead of multiplt connections/terminations is
much the same. Is there any real evidence of which incurs more
overhead? My guess is that the results might differ very much
depending on how  the kernel implements things like accept(), select()
et al....

There is no cpu overhead for idle connections. There is a memory overhead for
the TCP control block, but this is quite small. There is also a slight penalty
through more collisions in the hash table.

However, this TCP control block hangs around for some time after the connection
is closed, still taking up resources- one per connection. Thus the breakeven
point for memory use occurs when the average time between transactions is 
greater than 2MSL.

I don't think there are incompatibilities with the MGET proposal.
An old client with a new server would send only GET which the
server would honor.  A new client with an old server would send
an MGET and get a "method not supported" message and could repeat
the request with a series of GETS.  This is comparable to a new
client with "keep connection" dealing with an old server.

I would think the ultimate solution is to have an index of the documents ( and
their associated attributes ) be a completely seperate querriable entity.
This would allow users ( consumers, other servers!! ) to query the index and 
get the index results back. Then local relavance and cost based processing can 
be performedon on the returned data. Once the consumer is satisfied with the 
potential list of candidate hits they may retrieve them ( or just keep a link 
to their existance ). Using this approach the current infastructure for 
document retrieval can remain the same.

No, you pay a lot for session setup and tear down.  You pay in CPU 
cycles and resources on the server.  You pay in wasted network 
throughput for the client which is *extremely* costly on slow links 
(aka modem) especially with the ever growing set of  hypermedia 
documents that have lots of little graphics.

A server that is taking up a large portion of CPU on a non-active 
connected socket is a server that should be replaced.

Our engine builds a query-able index of the attributes, as well as a
full-word index.  The question I was asking was how we tag attributes in
the HTML documents so that they can be captured by a spider or other
indexing tool.

I'm not sure that being able to exchange the indexes is the ultimate
solution, but it's a very interesting one that we'd like to enable.
Instead of retrieving a number of indexes to one's local machine, it will
sometimes be more efficient to send a number of queries to search engines
where the indexes live, searching all of them in parallel.

I suspect that both models will co-exist.

The source changes on the server side are trivial. The client side 
changes are a bit trickier, because the Content-Length bytes need
to be counted (which is a good thing to do anyway). We sent the
client and server mods off to NCSA a little while ago, but they were
too late for the next release train.

Subject: Content Provider Problem?
content-length: 1791

It seems to me that security is a big deterrent to media companies
when it comes to putting their information on the Internet.  I want to
know what efforts exist to protect the content provider.

Basically, the problem decomposes into two areas:

1)Can you protect the information from being distributed.
2)Can you mark the information such that if it is distributed, you can
track the one who distributed it.

In each area one must consider audio, video, text, and images.

Area 1:

If the content provider encrypts the information with a user's public
key and provides a viewer that decrypts the information using the
user's private key, then ostensibly the information will be somewhat
secure if there is no way to save a deciphered version of the
information from the viewer.

Of course, other programs can grab the information off whatever output device
is being used.  Image grabs are trivial to do, video grabs and audio
grabs are somewhat harder.  A text grab would take some effort and
some OCR, but is possible.  However, one can imagine stumbling blocks
being put in place that would deter some of these, e.g. ignore certain
X events etc.

Area 2:

Well, how do you protect information if someone can grab it?  Chiefly,
I'm looking to see if anyone has investigated schemes to sign an
image/video/audio with the user's key that are not perceptible and
can't be removed from the information.

If anybody knows of people working on this problem, of papers that
exist, etc.  Please give me some pointers to the info.  Also, if
anyone knows of products that are being developed/exist in Area 1, I'd
be interested in this information also. (are the commercial web
browser people looking at this?)

Yes, but given that the point of computerized tools is to make
manipulation easier for the user, this seems counter-productive.

Hi,
I have a question on correct using of SELECT statement in a FORM.
I tried to use the following HTML code:

...
<FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/test-cgi">
<SELECT NAME="M">
<OPTION VALUE="value1"> Text 1
<OPTION VALUE="value2"> Text 2
</SELECT><INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="go"></FORM>
...

Is the use of VALUE in OPTION correct?
Mosaic 2.4  does what I want: if user selects Text 1, value1 is sent.
Lynx 2.3 doesn't what I want: if user selects Text 1, Text 1 is sent.

One implementation wrong? Or my HTML wrong? Or "undefined behaviour"?

Any hints welcome,
	Frank

Hello, 

We are working on a project called Interquest , to put a 
philosophy class on Mosaic and email. In the process 
we are using Mosaic forms to do interactions between
the class and the teacher. 

We want to do quizes and tests. We are working on methods to 
authenticate who the person taking the quiz is and to pass 
that information back with the form submission to the grader. 

Do you have suggestions about how to tie the WWW authentication
with the submitted information in a form?

While we are at it, do any of you have suggestions about
WWW features that you think would be a good thing we should
add into a Mosaic based class? We are coming down
to the wire to complete the class. So quick and focused suggestions
are most likely to make it into the class.

Subject: Holding connections open: an immodest proposal
content-length: 7669

This is a more than modest proposal, it is very long. I have stolen everyones
ideas that I could and not given any credit for them. This has been churning
round for ages but I think that we are now at the point where we can progress.

For more details see the somewhat outdated now:

http://alephinfo.cern.ch/AL2F01$DKA100/hallam/INFOGEN/WWW/SRC/http_development.html

The protocol synthesiser refered to is not in use at the moment. There
is however a synth for various MIME related objects. The DOOM synth may be
resurected once the MIME handling issues are sorted out.

http://ptsun00.cern.ch/home2/hallam/WWW/Mime/Specification/libraries.html


It is important to distinguish two cases :-

1) Loading all data segments associated with an object (eg html + inline images)

2) Contiuous mode connection for realtime response.


1 is solved best through use of MIME multipart type. The browser does a request
and gets back the complete object as a single document, inline images and all.
This is currently being added to the library but slowly :-(

There are two ways of doing this :

1) The server sends back everything as a unit
2) The client requests the inline images separately.

The Server is actually in the best position to know whether an image
is specific to one html or shared by many. Thus let the user defide whether 
to run the mime packer on a file or not. If the images are zipped up all
in a single fred.mime then they will always be sent together. This can also 
be done on the fly if a .mime is requested of a file only stored as .html,
this is a server special though.

The second method requires a slight chnge to the specs. Where we have at the
moment 

GET /path/fred.html http/1.0

I want to have 

GET /path/ http/1.0
Relative-URI: fred.html
Relative-URL: jim.html

This allows multiple requests in one GET. Note that only a single response
is returned, a multipart MIME. I already use the Relative URI tag in Shen
security. The user sends the line

NULL / http/1.0
DEK-INFO: DES, 02361371238
Secret-Header: uuendoded-des-encrypted-header

Where the decode of the secret header has the relative URL in it. NB,
this scheme allows choice of giving the URL on the command line, very usefull 
when proxying through non Shen compliant servers.


A second method of doing MGET is to permit wildcarding in a URL. For example
it would be nice to be able to specify a hierarchy of directories as is
possible under VMS.

[hallam...]
/hallam///

To me it looks like the only way of doing this extension in a compatible
manner is to use a tripple slash. Weenie UNIX servers then would return the
root directory only. Extended servers would send back the tree. We saw this in
htyper-G yesterday and it was very nice. Yes I know that the UNIX rules for
filename relativity may break but there is no reason why WWW URLs should
be slaves to UNIX. Since few people are using tripple slashes at the moment I
suggest that we have an opportunity for extension without backwards
compatibility problems.

I would like to have a page /hallam///*.html

I would also like to have a command:-

copy http://ptsun00.cern.ch/hallam/WWW///* http://dxal18.cern.ch/hallam/WWW

[We now know why the UNIX commands are two letters - they provide so little
functionality it is only worth typing half the number of characters. Copy
should work over the whole network in a transparent manner just as it does in
DECNET]


This implementation is a minimal one requirng no substantial changes to the
architecture of the likes of Mosaic. To go to continous connection is rather
more radical since the browser should be capable of receiving async messages.


2 is really a second protocol even though it may be a superset of http. Ie we
expect to use all the same specs except that content length is mandatory for
every block sent. This allows for conferencing and MUD connections and is in
practice a replacement for telnet.

Even here it is not strictly necessary to allow multiple gets. A POST method
with duplex transmission of MIME multipart messages would suffice. I suspect
that a different metod (DUPLEX) is justified though.


The original idea of HTTP was that you did a single send and a single receive
to obtain the object you want. NNTP and FTP negotiation is pretty futile and
the continous connection stuff is a real pain. We certainly do not need to do
an FTP style second connection simply to provide MGET.

I sketched out a suggestion for extending the HTTP protocol to multiple
transaction for the first conference. To sumarise :-

1) Ideally we want another protocol to do transactions BUT we also have to
	support TCP/IP. So put TTCP etc in the pending tray.

2) Semantics for accept headers should default to the first set specified.
	The user agent can't really change much during the transaction, nor
	are many of the other headers relevant so the simplest case is just
	to default everything to the last set of headers sent.

3) Multipart MIME, the content length is not required for the outermost body
	but must be there for all the innermost objects.

4) Need transaction methods:-
	START (Implicit at begin of transaction)
	COMMIT
	ROLLBACK

	NULL - for sending headers etc. This method is needed by the security
	extensions in any case.

5) A transaction is rolled back if the connection fails.


It is important to distinguish the original point of HTTPs single shot nature 
from the need for continous connections to provide functionality. FTP and
SMTP do not need to keep the connection. The fact that they do slows down
the process significantly. In the same way SMTP should be single shot.

Single shot telnet on the other hand is not a good idea. For a realtime system
there must be a means of sending unsolicited data. Here we are expanding HTTP
to a hyperterminal protocol. Lets face it Telnet is a pretty ugly protocol,
it dosen't even support my VT100 in a satisfactory manner let alone my
Xterminal. I want to connect to my computer in a seamless editing session
with high quality fonts and device independence. A terminal sending a HTML+
stream can provide high quality text, maths and images. Plus you can use the
security system to avoid telnets habit of sending plaintext passwords!

But we do not want to go back to the system whereby to get a news article you
have to send four commands and get back four responses and keep open a channel,
blocking other users from using the system and using resources needlessly. FTPs
throw you out whenever possible is pretty stupid.

One point:
	BURN PRAGMAS !
	PRAGMAS ? - JUST SAY NO.

Pragma keep alive is NOT acceptable. You are modifying the protocol completely
and not even using a tag. METHOD /url/ HTTP/2.0 is the only acceptable solution.
Continuous connection HTTP is a different protocol and MUST be announced as
such. It is a major revision to the protocol because it does not guarantee
backwards compatibility. The requirements for HTTP/2.0 on sending tags will be
stricter. Although a 2.0 server will be interoperable with a 1.0 one a valid 1.0
message will not necessarily be a valid 2.0 one.

We can create tags as and when needed. Either a tag has meaning or it does not.
Originaly Ari started the pragma because it was to do with the proxy server
which at the time was seen as being somehow peripheral to the grand scheme. 
Now we know that proxy servers are very important and in fact a central concept.
Pragma: NoCache should become Prohibit: Cache as soon as possible.

 


Summary:
	Yes we want connectionless and continuous connection HTTP. Possibly the
latter has a different name. But the spec is pretty much the same.

Here, due to overwhelming demand (or at least whelming demand :)...

The TCE Corporate Technical Memory (CTM) is a reference document repository 
constructed from World-Wide Web clients and servers, CGI scripts, WAIS, a 
short Visual C++ program, Microsoft's protected-mode TCP/IP for Windows, and 
a document submission/maintenance daemon written in Perl.

The document submission scenario (the part most imperfectly handled by 
current WWW clients) is:
1) The user specifies a document title, their name, a document file, and 
optionally a document abstract (abstracts are forced to be written in HTML 
so as to provide references).
2) This data is placed into an ASCII control file (similar to the old UNIX 
lp daemon control files).
3) The control file and data files are FTP'ed to a spool directory on the 
CTM server.  Microsoft's protected-mode TCP/IP for Windows has a 
command-file interface like UNIX FTP, making it easy to construct a command 
file to do this rather than having to code FTP directly.
4) The CTM daemon empirically determines whether the document file is a text 
file, a Word for Windows file (our corporate WP standard), or a binary file.
5) The document file (and abstract file) are placed in a standard location 
with each author having their own set of files.  Older versions (if there 
are any) are also placed in a standard location.
6) The document file is indexed via WAIS.  3 items of note:
     a) Word for Windows documents are indexed by their
        document text.
     b) If a document abstract exists for a binary file, that
        abstract is indexed in place of the binary file.
     c) The daemon re-indexes all documents nightly, as the
        updating of a document creates two references to it
        in freeWAIS.
7) Author and title databases are updated.

Documents can be browsed by title, by abstract for title, and by author. 
 Documents can be searched by WAIS full-text search, by author, by title, 
and by abstract for title.

The control-file method for submitting files is old technology, but it is 
inherently serialized (one daemon handles one file set at a time) and is 
still suitable for applications where real-time response is not required.

The submission program could instead be implemented as a WWW form if a 
client had a "submit this whole file" widget.  I envision such a widget 
looking something like:

            +---------------------------+  /---------\
     Document: |                    |  | Open... |
            +---------------------------+  \---------/
where the "Open..." is a labeled button that brings up a dialog box allowing 
you to select a local file rather than typing the name directly into the 
text box.


BTW, any pointers to where a paper on this might be submitted would be 
welcomed...

Hi -

Does anyone know where I can find info on an upcoming hypertext conference in  
edinburgh?  Sorry for the lack of info and posting to the list, but I figured  
someone here might be involved.  I understand TBL is speaking there.

I have been trying to find an answer to this question for some time.
There used to be an example of this in the NCSA fill-out forms examples
but it seems to have disappeared about 8 months ago.  I think X Mosaic still
supports it, but I don't think any of the other browsers do.  It sure would
be nice to find out if this is "real" HTML or not, cuz it sure seems
useful to me.

	Simply plug it into the HaLsoft Validation Service at

   The returned value defaults to the contents of the option element. 

The contents of the option element is presented to the user to represent the

I knew I forgot *something*...

The CTM code (such as it is) is TCE proprietary.  However, I predict that 
once the "submit whole file" widget is implemented, we will see several CGI 
scripts that utilize the capabilities of this widget in short order.

Yes, at least according to

MacMosaic 2.0a6 and MacWeb 1.0a2.2 also do not handle this correctly. The
author of MacWeb has stated that this will be fixed in the next major release.
I guess this is a good example of the problems with independent versions of
libwww.

take care,

        You may have solved it (below),  but if not then there remains 
the problem of non-graphical clients getting a big multipart object 
with GIFs it can't use.

        Eeeshh... but that could mean a lot of work. 
 
        Remember,  some (many?) servers are quite ignorant of HTML.

        This could,  I think,  handle the problem above.   A text-only 
client  (or a GUI with "load images" switched off for speed)  here has 
the option to not list the relative URLs.

        No it doesn't.   This is how multipart might provide the needed 
EOF indicator (which I will mention in another note).   Look for the boundary. 
Boundary lines must be guaranteed to be unique,  or must be out-of-band w/r/t 
the data they delimit.   But it works.

        It's worth mentioning that these apply to POSTing  (or GETting 
with arguments)  but not to R/O transactions.   (I could be wrong;  if so 
it would help us all if someone pointed out how and why)

        I don't see how SMTP's connection keeping is harmful. 
I can see it in FTP,  especially for the single-shot retrievals we're 
doing now with multiprotocol WWW browsers,  but how is SMTP slow because 
it waits for that final QUIT?

The problem with this is when there is a cache in the middle that
already has the inline images.

Indeed, I find that with caching hold-time parameters, the main
document is often timed out while the inlines remain in the cache
longer.

Given that by my measurements, inlines outnumber base documents on
about a 6 or 8 to 1 ratio, a loss of cache effectiveness for
inlines would significnatly harm overall performance.

        I've been putting off getting into this thread because it has 
fundamental implications and requirements that go beyond HTTP.

        It's trivial to add a QUIT command to a server. 
 
        It's non-trivial to indicate end-of-file without closing the 
TCP connection.   This is probably why FTP uses a second TCP connection 
(but I'm not Postel;  you'll have to ask him) 
 
        MIME is a Good Thing.   Multipart/mixed is a Good Thing. 
Given the lack of out-of-band EOF indicators aside from shutting down, 
multipart/mixed with just >one< object may help a bit.   The problem 
then becomes keeping the multipart boundary unique or (better) out of band. 
This implies Base64 encoding for too many things.

        Yes.   This will work.

        No.   It will always time out.   The clients will see  "slow" 
response times.   The client doesn't close the socket until it sees the 
close on the server's end.   It's too bad that TCP is always implemented 
with just one file descriptor.   Wouldn't it be useful (in cases like this) 
if the client could close its sending fd w/o closing its receiving fd?

        So ... I like the idea of a QUIT command.   Added QUIT to a certain 
HTTP server I wrote.   (but I'm on Rice time just now so I can't talk 
about that ;-) )   But we need "structure" information,  starting with an 
EOF marker for lingering connections to work,  or we need multiple 
connections per session ala FTP (please NO).

Yes, exactly.  I contend this solution will take longer to deploy than
my proposal for the server to hold the connection open (for awhile).
I think it's more complex, and, when the MIME solution is deployed,
there will be compatibility problems until everyone upgrades.

True, but irrelevant, for two reasons:
	1) Even if an image is multiply shared, I may only ask for one of
	documents in which it's used.
	2) I may already have the image cached in my client.
So only the client actually knows if it NEEDS the image.

How often do I really want to get a whole directory hierarchy?  What
happens if intermediate points in the hierarchy are mapped by the
server to different files that are not in the actual file hierarchy?

I shrink from the "continuous connection" label.  In any case, how does
that prevent a browser from taking async messages?  (Where are they
coming from?) The browser isn't typically listening for a connection --
it initates them.  If you're talking about things like window system
events, keeping a connection open has no effect on fielding such
asynchronous events, does it?

I assume this "2" is what you call "continuous mode connection", not "request
all images separately".

I endorse a single send and a single receive.  I want to keep the
connection open "just a little bit longer" in case it proves to be
useful.  It's a bit like those pay phones where you give your credit
card at the beginning, and then when you finish your first call, you
can hit a button to make a second, without having to give your card
number again.

Please reexamine my proposal and some facts.
1) After a TCP/IP connection closes, the host is obliged to tie up the
resources for about 2 minutes, in case some tardy packets arrive.
2) I proposed to keep a connection open on the order of tens of seconds
in case a new GET (or other method, for that matter) arrives.
3) Therefore my proposal holds resources out of use for no more than,
say, 25% longer than they would be anyway.
4) In the event that there was in fact an image URL in what the server
returned, and the client needs it, the already-open connection saves
connection setup time, slow-start time, and having a second (or more)
connection around lingering in TCP/IP's close-wait timeout when it
eventually gets closed.

Let me offer some more thoughts about why "sustained connection" (I
think "continuous connection" is too strong and misleading) may be a
good thing beyond the familiar discussions.  Stuff is coming along that
will require negotiation between client and server:  security, and
payment for information.

Consider, even now, the WWW Basic security scheme.  The server rejects
a client's request and demands authentication.  The connection closes.
After the client gets name and password, it starts a new connection and
repeats the request.  However, if the client has cached the name and
password, it can respond immediately (no delay to query the user).
With a sustained connection, the same transactions would take place,
but over the originally created connection.

If the negotiation paradigm -- reject request, query user, re-request --
becomes common, the cost of opening and closing connections becomes
more painful.

You feel a sustained connection is a major change to HTTP.  I agree it's
a violation of the purity of the model, but in practical terms I think
it's a small change with potential benefits.

        John,  I don't know why you included explicit  "\n"  references. 
A companion "need" we have to things like EOF is a clear concept of a 
command line or any line of text.   The newline is understood so I was 
a little disturbed by it.   I edited the excerpt.

        Whether it's pragma or some other method,  you're absolutely 
right that both must be aware of the other's keep-connection capability 
*beforehand*.   Resorting to timeouts is sub-optimal.

That last sentence seems to carry an implicit assumption that images are 
*always* on the same server that references them, which is clearly not true. 
Unless you mean for the server to use a citation index such as the Webcrawler 
one...

In general, sending a package of text+images requires that there is also a 
separate file of just text, for text mode browsers, or that textmode browsers 
are forced to download all the images then discard them. The former solution 
imposes a load on the server maintainer - many servers are all maintained by 
hand, so thre is a risk that the html in the text+images file and the text only 
file diverges. The latter solution uis rather a waste of bandwidth.

One possibility, if an all-in-one text+images file is deemed desirable, is to 
have the server construct the all-in-one file on the fly and cache it for future 
requests. It would need to check the last modified date of all the components 
though, each time it sent the all-in-one file.

Phil, your suggestion did not address the case I outlined yesterday about images 
cached in the client and in intervening cacheing proxies. Could you outline how 
your proposed solution deals with this?

        Content-length should not be used here. 
 
        Content-length requires that the server count bytes or acquire a 
byte count from the filesystem.   The latter may not be available. 
The former involves potentially  HUGE  amounts of temporary storage. 
Why must the output of a script be held until the program terminates? 
What we need is a way to indicate  end-of-file  to the HTTP client.

        Being a streams fiend I may be blind here,  but isn't TCP itself 
nothing more or less than a stream?   HTTPD really breaks down to just 
 
                client_producer | HTTPD | client_consumer 
 
        Personally I *love* this.   It's simple.   The only problem 
with it is that  client_producer  and  client_consumer  are both 
represented by the same  file descriptor.   :-(

No.

My opinion, and echoed by people around here: content providers are just 
going to have to deal with these realities.  It's *unnatural* to the 
medium to try to do 1 and 2.  For every step you can take towards trying 
to enforce this, someone can write a program to break that down, probably 
with less effort than you spent, too.  That said, it is certainly 
possible to work against sites committing massive copyright fraud, but 
trying to prevent the average user from passing along some bits to 
another user just isn't going to work.

"bits is bits"... there's no functional difference, really, other than 
some types take up a lot more space than others.

But it would be relatively easy, especially if I had source to the 
decrypting viewers, to write a "debabelizer" to convert the encrypted 
data to ordinary data.  No screen grabbing or X events needed.  Of 
course, this presumes that the encryption format is a standard or well 
known - if it's not, we've got more things to worry about than copyright.

There has been talk here, I think, that one solution is to imbed into the 
data the content provider sends some sort of information about who 
received it - then, if a rogue archive of the CP's data appeared 
somewhere, you could trace it to a particular recipient and act 
accordingly.  That's the way many commercial software packages work - 
"this copy licensed to *blah*" appears on the startup screen and is 
unchangeable (well, without hacking at the bit level I suppose).  The 
problem is in finding embedding methods, particularly for plain text.

This is the most sensible proposal for multi-request
transactions I've seen.  With this scheme, it would
take at most two TCP connections to fetch an HTML document
with all its associated inline graphics, annotations, &c.
Two connections seems reasonable.

You don't address protocol negotiation, though, which
I think will be necessary:  existing servers would interpret
the above multi-object request as a single request for '/path/', and
new clients wouldn't have any way to tell that what they got back
isn't what they asked for.  (Checking for 'Content-Type: multipart/xxx'
in the reply won't work, since that's a legitimate HTTP/1.0 reply.)

Why not call the method 'MGET' and the protocol 'HTTP/1.1'?

One other question: how does the client tell which body
part in the response corresponds to which request?

I concur wholeheartedly.

"Session-oriented" HTTP where the connection stays open
may be useful in the future, but a single-transaction,
multiple-object GET request is easier to do and solves
a lot of problems *today*.

It has been impressed upon me many times that http is, despite the debate 
about keeping connections alive, more efficient than ftp.  This is 
obvious for small files - FTP opens two virtual circuits comapred to 
HTTP's one.  But is this the case for large files?  Is there a difference 
to serving >500K files via http and ftp?

Yes; these are probably orthogonal issues.  The second would be useful
for an ongoing conversation; in particular, it might be useful for a
session with a caching proxy.  It's not hard to envision cases where
you might want the former inside the latter.

I'd not agree with this; the client, not the server, knows what the
client wants.  It's also very hard to make this backward-compatible,
since most existing clients can't handle multipart messages (can't
even hand them off to an external viewer.)

Karl Auerbach responded:

Or the browser already has the inline images.  Or the user doesn't
want the inline images.  Or the inline images are available in
multiple formats and a separate content-type negotiation must be done.

Makes sense; images tend not to change very much while documents do.
This means you want to, in a minimal number of transactions, do
requests for all the images where many of them are conditional.

The only real alternative anyone has suggested to Content-Length: is
the MIME multipart boundary approach.  It's not clear to me that
that's better, and it sure as heck isn't backward-compatible.

Yes, it is, which is part of why it's not really optimally suited to
carrying HTTP, which is not a stream-oriented protocol.  The issue is
whether the best solution, in both the short-term and long-term, is to
use something other than TCP that works better for HTTP-style stuff
or change HTTP to work better with TCP.

One way around this is to define a new MIME
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary-packetized,
something like:

    The server sends a binary stream in packets,
    each packet prefixed with a 2-byte packet
    length in network byte order.  Packets can be 
    any convenient size from 1-65K bytes.  The data
    stream is terminated by a zero-length packet.

This would have very little overhead compared to
straight binary encoding, and much less overhead than 
base64.

Another option is to use the Content-Length: header.
This may place an undue burden on servers when sending
automatically generated binary objects (like WebWorld
does).  A binary-packetized encoding would let the
server send the object in pieces as it's being
generated, instead of having to buffer the whole
thing just to count the total number of bytes.

You can do this with the BSD sockets API with 
the shutdown(2) call.  Don't know about other
implementations though.

Accepted, except that if the document is not actually on the server in question
then an MGET is not really appropriate. Unless we are talking proxies...

This is why there really has to be two requests if it isn't a monolithic
object. What we can do is to sent the accept headers as normal and 
instead of having a monolithic mime have a list of items to send. The
server reads the list and constructs the multipart chunk by chunk.

We would prefer to kill multipart boundaries except for the purpose of
giving the final EOF marker. The pattern matching algorithms take a
significant time and they really cannot be defended in an 8 bit clean
protocol. They are a hack to get through mail gateways.

>        I don't see how SMTP's connection keeping is harmful. 
The post is logically one operation but in normal SMTP you have to do three
operations to send a mail where one would suffice. The point is not
the keeping the connection or not the point is that the traditional
negotiation of header information is a bad idea. It is a human oriented
and not a machine oriented protocol. 


Most Everyone complained re caching/proxies:

	in the case of a cache the cache simply knowck out all the relative
urls that it can send itself. The only point where this falls apart is when
the security is used (Shen, SHTTP can't proxy) since removing a relative
URL line would break the message digest of the head. This could be got arround
with extra `do not send headers'. This can be done as follows:

Digest-Boundar: MD5, random
Relative-Url: url1
MIC-HEAD: xyz
Relative-Url: url1
If-Modified-Since: 1-Jan-1900


The semantics of if-modified since then have to be specified such that it
relates either to the main url or to the last url specified in a relative
url tag.

Remmember that under the scheme there are two requests, one to fetch the base
document and one to fetch the associated bits 'n pieces from the server
in question. There are a few extra issues to consider wrt proxies and in
paticular wrt security.

content-length: 557

A couple of people have beat into my feeble brain the show-stopper
problem with my modest proposal:  not all servers reliably return
Content-Length in response to each GET.  Therefore clients rely on
getting EOF (i.e., a dropped connection) to know when they've gotten
everything.  Which means, therefore, that servers can't hold open a
connection, or the client will keep waiting until it times out.

So, with apologies to all for the chatter and bandwidth, I withdraw my
modest proposal.  (Gee, it seemed like such a good idea at the time.)

Well speaking from where libwww comes from I think the multipart solution
is probably more realistic. The networking chunk of libwww is in the engine
bay being stripped down to go multithreaded. I don't think we can realisticaly
expect to try changing the spec at the same time.

On the other hand the current mime parsers are scheduled for demolition
and we have the replacement going through beta test (standalone) at the
moment. Once it passes regression etc we can move on to try the integration
phase.

>	2) I may already have the image cached in my client.

This is why we really need two requests, now we could keep the connection
for the second. The advantage is not quite as great however since we
have gone from O(n) to O(2). The client only requests the images it
needs. Proxies in the middle chop out any requests they can satisfy. There
are security issues but these are quite tricky. Not all proxies may be
trusted. If you use the proxy as your security agent things are different 
again.

Comming from the VMS world I use searches of the whole file hierarchy every

in the VMS operating system. If you haven't got it you should find out
what life is like with it...

My prototype browser, Bilbo used continuous connection to do conferencing

It is an area where the functionality improvement is dramatic. It fully
justifies the paradigm shift. 

[Note, Bilbo died recently, but we are recycling most of the design into
libwww and other W3O ware]

Well its not a case of optimising resources quite at that level *yet*. First
off we are thinking beyond TCP/IP. A fundamental change in the philosophy
of HTTP is politically quite a difficult thing. Many people here want to
call the protocol something different.

When I raised the idea of keeping the connection open for this purpose at
WWW'94 there was quite a bit of resistance to the idea. It is a small step
for coding to do something that optimises our current situation. BUT we
want to be arround in ten years time. Before we allow continuous connection
into the spec we have to demonstrate that it works through proxies, and
can provide the conferencing, hyperterminal and transaction processing
benefits too.

To support multipart mime we do not actually need to change the specs at all.
It is actually in the current specs (!) The issues raised are on the level
of optimisation (behaviour of proxy chains).

Negotiation is not required for security. In many circumstances a one shot
connection can be maintained. for more details consult the Shen docs:

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html

The WWW-Basic scheme was introduced because of all the hassle that the USA
put up concerning export regulations. We now have a DIGEST method that is
equivalent in terms of convenience but does not involve sending passwords
in the clear across the internet.

I agree in principle. I would consider transaction processing to be an even
better example. Imagine you want to synchonise the modules you have checked
out from a server with the master library. This requires two steps:-

1) Request a list of the module that are currently checked out

2) Replace each one into the library in turn.

The library should not change between 1 and 2. We need to lock it.

It is a very major change, it is easy to implement but the specification
needs to be thought of carefully. The key point is that the security scheme
and conferencing interact very strongly with this question. This is why
the original PGP and PEM proposals were unsatisfactory. They prevented
the use of continous connection in a conference environment and in any case
did not proxy.

[Out of band comment #1a
	When Ari came to CERN he was meant to be doing security work. Instead
	he developed the proxy server. If he had done the security work first
	instead proxying might have not been possible because too many
	other changes to the spec may have stopped it from working 
	efficiently. we have to ensure that we do not cut ourselves off
	from other ideas like proxying for the sake of `optimisation'
	that turns out not to be.]


Just a small out of band comment here. Most WWW people think that it is
a document system. It is not. Or rather that is a tiny fraction of its
potential. Here at CERN we want to run the biggest and most expensive
experiment ever using the networking structures and model of WWW. There
are people looking into building operating systems based on the WWW
technology, it can potentialy provide the `binding energy' between
many currently separate areas, in particular AI. We are no longer able to
decide the <IMG> tag in the 9 hour period between Marc thinking about it and
having finished the implementation. People are demanding that we produce
industrial quality specs and stick to them. In the past the spec could be
altered quickly and the code was the thing that took time today the exact
opposite is true.

Is there any place to find detailed Web Server architecture documented
for the reader interested in implementation, or do I have to read the
code? All the technical references I've found so far are at too high a
level. I'm interested in details like how sockets and processes are
used, how the protocol is translated, and so on. Thanks for any help.

We have already had to solve this problem on POST. Originaly the POST spec
read that to signal the end of the stream you closed the connection. This
was not a success :-)

We should try to stick with the single connection because if the user is
not on TCP/IP two connections may not be possible. For example a user on
a dialup modem line with a local client talking continuous mode HTTP to
a proxy that does all the IP. For this scheme running IP is not what is wanted
at all, its only overhead and administration. IP is in any case a poor
protocol for a portable machine that moves about regularly :-)


The requirement to send Content-Length is pretty simple to satisfy except
when you have an item being synthesized on the fly. Here I would prefer to
use a multipart and send content length on each block, the overhead is not
too great :-

Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=end

Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 10

1234567890


Content-Length: 10

1234567890


Content-Length: 10

1234567890


---end  


The header for each segment defaults to the previous one given so we don't 
need to keep sending content type. So the blocking penalty is

strlen ("content-length: ") + 6 + ceil(log10 (length))

Say 20 bytes/block? Sound expensive? Not so much as having to search for the
end of buffer pattern.


Plus if the thing is really big - ie too big to buffer the other end
a segmented reply would have a lot of advantages, could do interleaving
and other cool things.

You can send a QUIT command under the blocking scheme and still keep a useful
connection. The server only needs to send the bytes that it has contracted for
under the last segment

IMHO block sizes of 64K would be appropriate on the internet. other networks
milage might differ. There could be a header tag to suggest a block size:

Permit-Chunking: 65536

If no chunking tag given, no chunking allowed. The size should only be a
suggestion though.and would not bind either party.

HTTP is 8 bit clean. We do not want to have people spreading social diseases
like Base64 encoding round here thank you very much :-)


Now the HTML proposal is getting pretty much nailed down and there is a 
clear idea on at least the principles of HTML 2.0 and HTML+ 3.0 we should
start a discussion on what should go into HTTP 2.0. Should there be a HTTP+
that cleans out some of the methods that we never implemented (CHECKOUT)
and provides the conferencing and transaction support? It can't be called
HTTP+ though, that would break most of the servers.


We also need to derrive a version of HTTP that uses binary tags (eg ASN.1)
for speed. We know how we can move the library in that direction but it is
a lot of work and there are other more pressing concerns.

Re: this above conversation.  Clearly how liquid information "is" and
who owns "what" is a rather religious debate.  But, let's not be
inflammatory.  To find out what is reasonable in the paradigm of
Internet uber alles, we have to explore the issue in depth in *every*
direction.  Only then can we reach a model which adequately
compensates the content provider for his/her efforts while not
creating inoordinate barriers to the use of said content.  I think the
above is everybody's goal, but it is still too early to say what
exactly works.

   A well behaved client would close the connection when it was idle.
   We probably need to figure the heuristics, but as a first cut I would
   suggest dropping the connection between each document fetch -- i.e. a
   single connection would be used to catch all the embedded images and
   such.

At MIT Information Systems we have CWIS software called TechInfo whose
protocol keeps the connection open for an entire session.  We've had
plenty of time to think about when the connection should be closed and
when it should be left open.

There are two states the server can be in:

State 1:  The number of open connections is below a certain threshold,
say 30.  There's practically no cost to leaving them open.  Clients on
slow links reap the benefit of not having to reopen the TCP connection
every time they want to retrieve a document.

State 2:  The number of open connections has reached the threshold.
Choose the connection that has been idle the longest and close it.

Clients never decide to close the connection before the end of the
session because they have no way of knowing if there's any reason to
close it.

The effect of closing connections based on idle time is that the
quickness of server response corresponds to the quickness of user
actions, resulting in a nice feel to the system.

This is a terrible way to solve that problem.  Being able to serve and
handle MIME multipart type objects is a good thing, but it should not be
used to pre-package all inline images.

I disagree.  No one knows this, not even the original author.  The presence

I don't like the idea of using headers to indicate something that is
clearly a different method.  I particularly don't like those two because
they fail to indicate their purpose.  I would much prefer an "MGET" method
which can operate on a list of URIs or include that list as request content,
e.g.

    MGET <uri>.mget HTTP/1.1

would tell the server to enclose all of the objects listed in the <uri>.mget
object into a multipart response (note that <uri>.mget may be automatically
generated by the server), and


    MGET <uri> HTTP/1.1
    Content-type: application/x-www-uri-list
    Content-length: xxxx

    <uri>

    <uri>
    Optional-Request-Header: blech

    <uri>

would do the same except the list would be taken from the request content.
All URIs in the list can be considered "relative" to the URI used as the
first parameter of the MGET method (which means they may also be absolute
URLs).  The request headers for each URI would default to those included
with the MGET, unless they are overridden/supplemented by ones immediately
following the URI.

The hitch is that caching proxies would have to parse the request, handle
those that can be fulfilled locally, and issue their own MGET request (or
equivalent for other protocols) for those it can't fulfill.  Although this
would be complicated, it is certainly doable, and I doubt that any other
scheme would be less complicated once caches are taken into account.

As for security issues, I am increasingly convinced that they belong in
an entirely separate protocol -- one that may be initiated by an HTTP
request, but only confirmed and maintained via a non-HTTP session.

ABSOLUTELY NOT!

The "/" character in URL paths has a very significant meaning -- using it
like this would break every attempt we have made at standardizing the URL
syntax.  If you want to make special exceptions for WWW, just use the '*'
character on its own.  That character is not allowed unencoded in a URL,
and thus would not likely conflict with normal use anyway.

I still think the MGET method or the multipart mime solutions are the best.

MGET surely is the easiest to implement. 
most methods that hold the connection open do trust the client to close it
as soon as possible. Surely someone will come up with a browser mis-using
this feauture, claiming to have written a very fast browser (eg If I
were to connect to sunsite to visit EXPO, it is faster for the client to
keep the connection open a very long time so the client doesn't have to
re-open the connection for every new page of the exhibit). Ok it will
be faster for the particular browser, but until the server can handle
the huge amount of open connection, this is not disirable behaviour.

MGET methods are save, and don't break current practice (in contrast
what has been said in this discussion)

Multipart mime is more powerfull, but much harder to implement.

I still fail to see why MGET or Multpart mime cannot do what people in
favour of open connections want to do.

Not really. FTP sets up a control connection, then starts a new virtual 
circuit for each file. Once file transfer is in progress, both FTP and HTTP
should have identical performance characteristics (providing that neither is
doing any presentation transformation such as FTP's ascii mode)

I suspect that if this were true that the big information providers
won't publish through the web and will invent an alternative
mechanism more to their liking.  You might say that this means
they are going against the tide.  However, for a lot of information
they are the only game in town and folks will jump through a lot of
hoops to get (and pay for) their information.

I would send this directly to Simon, but I can't find his e-mail address
right now.  In any case, I think ALL people building HTTP server's should
be aware of this as well.

The MDMA server that was just installed at http://sunsite.unc.edu/ is broken.
If this were an experimental site, I wouldn't care.  However, SunSITE is
a major site, and the fact that it is broken may have major ramifications
to those who link to it.

Why it is broken:

   1) Does not support the HEAD request

      This is the easiest method for a server to support.  It is very
      important for link verification tools and for many caching servers.
      It is simply inexcusable not to support it on a major server.

   2) Fails to include a Date: header on responses.  This header is necessary
      for cache management.

   3) The ctime format is used for the Last-modified: date.  That format
      hasn't been used by valid servers in over a year!

   4) Does not support the If-Modified-Since header (conditional GET protocol)
      that allows for efficient cache updates.

   5) Uses pathetic error messages.  For example:

      ---------------------------------
      HEAD http://sunsite.unc.edu/ HTTP/1.0
      User-Agent: HEAD/0.4 libwww-perl/0.40
      From: fielding@rome.ics.uci.edu

      HTTP/1.0 501  Something broke
      MIME-Version: 1.0
      Content-Type: text/html

      <H1>Error 501</H1>
      ---------------------------------

This is not the kind of thing that I would ever want to encounter
at a production site, certainly not at one as well-funded as SunSITE.
As WWW developers, we should all realize that changes to often-used
servers need to be made with great care.  Failing to do so makes us
all look like a bunch of flakes.

Simon, I know you are capable of fixing the above.  Either fix them now
or reinstall the NCSA server.

Can you explain this?  If the Date: is just the current time doesn't the
client/proxy server know it as well as the server.

This may be a "good thing", but it is not in the HTTP/1.0 spec and hence
a server claiming to be HTTP/1.0 shouldn't be called broken for that 
reason.

I think some of your other criticisms have merit.  In addition it would
be nice if the server identified itself with a Server: header.

Roy - you message was a little harsh, but that's ok. I really still like you,
and think you're a really nice person. I really want to make you happy, and
I'll do the best I can. 

I understand you have problems with caching, and support for caching wasn't
the top priority. There'll support for head and Date in the new version coming
out next week. 

If-Modified-Since wasn't in the version of the HTTP specs I coded to, and 
although I may put it in, there are some really severe tradeoffs in 
implementing it that affect real users, not cache users. 

The Error messages in the running version are rather spartan, but they will
to be replaced later this week with internationalised error messages, with
initial support for French and English. 

I just want everybody to be happy, and the way we're serving 85% more 
web documents a day with HTTPD not even showing up on the top 20 process list,
makes us happy here. 

By the way, as of midnight tonight, I will no longer be working for the 
University of North Carolina. I'll be around for a week more, then I'll be
in Europe until the Web Conference in Chicago. I've had a great time working
here; I just wish it was as well funded as you believe it to be.

MDMA currently sends a Server: header of 
Server: MDMA/0.1

This will be changing next week, to add information about which BGI module is 
being used to handle this request.

Subject: access and session control
content-length: 989

Hi,
  I've been designing and am about to implement some session control and
access restrictions for some documents served, searched and retrieved via
a web server.  This is meant as a stop gap thing until the world has
some for of secure http clients/servers.  The basic design is that
all acesses will go through a CGI program.  This program will modify any
URL's in documents to ensure the triggering the URL while redirect it's
action via the CGI program.  The program will also add some a session key
to the URL.  For example, if a document contained the following:

<A HREF=http://foo.bar/baz.html>  (where my server is running on foo.bar)

this might be rewritten as:

<A HREF=http://foo.bar/cgi-bin/access?file=baz.html+session_key=SK>

(where SK is the session key which gets passed around)

The web server while keep state associated with the session key.

I assume that similar things have been done.  Does anyone have any pointers?

My solution to this also addresses the scaling issue, something we are
going to have to face up to in the next few years. Distributed caching
helps to avoid network bottlenecks as people try to down load documents
from key servers. For copyrighted material, this means you have also need
to distribute the security mechanisms that ensure only "licensed" users
can get access to the material as intended by the publisher.

So one approach is to allow unlimted distributed caching of encrypted
copyrighted material, and for publishers to use trusted "book shops" to
handle the end-user access mechanism. In otherwords, an end-user can
pay a bookshop for per-use or unlimited use of some book or magazine.
The bookshop is instructed by the publisher as to what licence schemes
are acceptable, and pays the publisher in the traditional manner. The
distributed cache acts as an analog of the traditional distribution
channel, but in this case, the book shop can get copies immediately rather
than having to wait days or weeks for the next shipment.

As for the encryption mechanism, publishers could use DES or similar and use
public key technology to authenticate book shops and pass them the DES key
and sales policy info. End users can still cache documents for which they
have paid, and in the long term we still would benefit from hardware based
security mechanisms to enforce licence terms at the client's site. The above
scheme is relatively easy to implement using Secure HTTP. Scaling and
copyright concerns will soon give birth to the tiered distribution channels
on the Internet that are so familiar to us in the everyday world.

Content-Length is fine where the server is reading from file it can stat,
but becomes problematic where the response is generated by say a program.

Another approach is to use a byte code escape mechanism, e.g.

        a)  replace all occurrences of \ by \\ and '\0' by \0
        b)  use '\0' not preceded by a \ to denote stream delimiter

Actually '\0' is a bad choice here since it crops up too frequently,
so one might want to use a more elaborate multibyte scheme. This approach
can be efficiently processed on the fly and wouldn't impose a heavy burden
unlike the multipart boundary scheme with its look ahead requirements.

We now introduce a new encoding name, say  Content-Encoding: x-stream
which browsers can recognize and treat accordingly. Needless to say
the server only uses this encoding if the client states it can accept
it, perhaps this would be implied by the keep alive pragma.

The remaining issue is how servers determine stream delimiters in
client requests. The problem here, is what happens when a new client
talks to an old server - perhaps someone else can comment on this?

There is already such a scheme in SMTP the sequence \cr\lf\.\cr\lf terminates
a stream and is escaped by \cr\lf..\cr\lf.

But it is real uggli bunnies.

I think that this misses the point. We are used to having this idea of images
being separate from the text only because that is the way our tools are
oriented. What I was suggesting is that in many cases there are texts that
have a direct relationship to an image and to have one without the other is
pointless. For example an art gallery where each image has a descriptive text.

We have to handle multipart soon because the mail viewer should do mime.
BTW could a few people send some multipart mime with images etc to me on
dxal18? I need some test data.


The reason why inline images can be cached so well at the moment is that in the
most part they are abused. They add no semantic content, just look pretty
and are liberaly spread about the place just in case you missed them the
first time.

The idea of prepackaging a multiformat document as a mime is not appropriate
if the inline images are merely icons that are regularly reused. In other
cases prepackaging is appropriate. Only the author can really tell.

Of course the original author can know this in many cases but not every case.
So if the author does not know they do not encapsulate.

This would mean very long method lines which would break many servers. Plus
there is no real difference between a single get and a multiple get. The
operation is on a different object, that is all. It is on a composite object
that is the sum of all the parts.

HTTP without security is not much use. Security objects are no different
from any other, they can be refered to by URL or URN. They can be retreived.

I was proposing that it be valid for all protocols, not just http. We could
however use

/hallam			Non Recursive directory
/hallam/*  		All the objects in the directory
/hallam/**		directory tree
/hallam/***		All the objects in the directory tree


So GET /hallam/* would return a multipart with all the objects in the 
directory in it.

This sort of thing would not be too usefull for clients but very nice for
other applications.

No the server knows as well because the client sends an accept field.

Of course if the client sends Accept: */* with no quality field and does
not know what to do with it then the system will break.

I had an idea to deal with this, ammending the content type so that
a */* match without quality field defaulted to q=0.01 and have a cutoff
for sending multipart if the q factor was not > 0.1

We can call it the M-Kludge.

(because its needed for MIME - what did you think it stood for?)

Hey we are getting somewhere. 

I like this idea except that 2 byte is not really enough. I would prefer to
have at least 32 and preferably 64 bits. 32 bits is only 4Gb. For intra
process transfers 4gb is not much.

Alternatively what we can do is :-

Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary-packet; field=2

For a 2 byte field. Clients would have to accept 1, 2 and 4 byte ids. Perhaps
we should go for an 8 byte id as well... It would not be too difficult even
on a 32 bit machine.

This could be overlaid on any content type and is orthogonal which is
rather nice. The only difficulty I see is that the packets should be the
outermost encapsulation. But at the moment encryption is the outermost 
encapsulation since you want to compress before you encrypt.

Anyone played with HyperG?  Not that it would solve all you mention here, but  
certinly addresses many of the maintaince issues we all are facing, perhaps  
exemplified by this post.   I'm wondering who has any experience with HyperG,

OK, sounds fair enough. I would like to increment the protocol minor as well.

This then fits in quite neatly since the server can send a header back
saying the MGET works and the client can remember that for making the inline
requests. so the sequence is :-

GET /fred/page.html http/1.1

If methods is: GET, MGET ...
MGET  /fred/ http/1.1

If methods is: GET or response is http/1.0
GET /fred/a
GET /fred/b
...


|>One other question: how does the client tell which body

There have to be headers in each mime segment to specify this. 
This is the bit that has not yet been thought out on the multipart front.


OH, before I forget, another good use for the multipart stuff. The message
digest can be sent in the trailer of the message. This means that it is not
necessary to read the file twice, once to calculate the id and again to
send it. The digest can be seeded using a random seed sent encrypted in the
header to avoid multiple RSA processing.

Um, I must not be understanding what you mean.

When retrieving an HTML document, there is nothing about the
Accept: field which indicates whether the client is capable of, or
interested in, fetching and displaying inlined images (or, more generally,
any other items which are logically part of that same document.)

Heh heh... of course, it's not needed for MIME, which is in the spec already,
but for broken clients.  Hence the other meaning.

I'm fairly against adding kludges to the protocol in which we assume that
the client is lying in the Accept: fields.  Fix the damn clients.

It is rather unclear to me is what you mean by "in the directory
tree", especially in the context of "all protocols". What are the
semantics when "/hallam" is not a simple directory, but dynamically
generated by a script or so? Do you fail, or do you run a local robot
and pass it all the HTTP headers you got from the client? The latter
would be neat, but an enouremous overhead.

I'm don't think I like these special URL encodings -- why not specify
a normal URL as part of new methods? That wouldn't break existing
servers/clients, and save you from the uri hornets nest. For example:

GET   /hallam		Non Recursive directory
LIST  /hallam  		All the objects in the directory
RLIST /hallam		directory tree
RGET  /hallam		All the objects in the directory tree

Yeah, like robots and mirrors -- will people really allow this on
their servers, even if you recursively check modification dates
against an If-modified-since? I certainly won't without out of band
bilatreal agreement with clients.

	From: narnett@verity.com (Nick Arnett)

	Our engine builds a query-able index of the attributes, as
	well as a full-word index.  The question I was asking was how
	we tag attributes in the HTML documents so that they can be
	captured by a spider or other indexing tool.

However the indexable attributes are tagged in HTML documents, I
believe it is important that there should be some way to closely
associate index entries with the text they are about.  In other words,
the index entries should be immediately next to (before or after) the
paragraph or list item.

This is especially important for larger documents, but even for small
documents.  There are benefits to users and authors.  Searching tools
can refer to the relevant part of the document, as if the tag were an
anchor.  The author of the document is reminded of the index entries
and can correct them as needed or move them along with the text during
editing.

Are meta tags only allowed in the HEAD of a document?  If so, I dont
believe they are sufficient for indexing.  Probably some filter should
be used to extract the embedded index tags to store them separately.

	I'm not sure that being able to exchange the indexes is the ultimate
	solution, but it's a very interesting one that we'd like to enable.

While I am suspicious of any scheme involving manual replicatiion,
automatic replication (caching) will be required for scalability.
Caching indexes is the easy part, but caching of services such as
searching services is trickier.

If /hallam is not a simple directory then the script can chose to do
what it likes. For smoe scripts it actually makes sense to allow such urls.
For example in a mail server there is an implicit hierarchy. I don't see this
as a problem since there are many files that the recursive descent would
not be appropriate for - ie any that is not a directory.

I don't want extra methods. They cannot be used without a new browser. I
can ask the M-object to get url /hallam/* and it will do it.


There is a problem with the /** convention, how does it work with

/*.html  is all the files with a .html extension

/**.html is what ?

/m*.html 	is all files matching the pattern
/**m*.html	is what?

or should we have /*/m*.html ? This seems to work better.

So this would mean changing the uri spec to state that /*/ indicated a
recursive descent of directories.

This sort of stuff is actually there at the moment in the configuration 
side of the server.

Absolutely! I was thinking it would be neat to use it to synchronise the files
between all the development platforms here. NFS, and RCP have severe
limitations.

It would not be the sort of thing that you would want to have everyone doing 
but we have enough security schemes, access controls etc. We can always
develop some sort of ACL.

I would not want to allow a robot to do a GET on the whole filestore but I
might allow a HEAD or some sort of analysis to be done. This might well be
cached. This sort of thing would mean that a robot could get all the information
it wants in a single get and not need to do multiple gets.

So the robot would ask :-

GET /*/*?analyse http/1.1
accept: multipart/mixed


and get back

209 You are pushing it  mate but OK just this once.
Content-type: multipart/mixed
Content-Length: 69 (its long mate)

<list of urcs for all the urls you care to name>



On the other hand if the robot asks

GET /*/* http/1.1
accept: multipart/mixed

the response is :


502 Insufficient resources. What do you think I am? your personal slave?


Are we making progress here?

One of the highlights from WWW'94 was the roadmap for HTML
which nailed down some common terminology for specific browser
capabilities:

	HTML 1.0 	Original RFC
	HTML 2.0 	Current practice as of 5/94 to 
			be specified and endorsed by IETF
			standard by end of 1994.(?)
	HTML 3.0	Place holder for HTML+ features and
			various proposed new elements.

I wonder if a similar roadmap exists for changes in the 
HTTP protocol :

	HTTP 0.9	in the beginning
	HTTP 1.0	Original RFC (?)

	HTTP 1.1	Proxy/cache extensions If-modified-since,
			Pragma no-cache (Pragma keep-connection?)

	HTTP 1.2	MGET and multipart MIME responses

	HTTP 2.0 	Sessions?

It would be good to have a list of proposed changes in the protocol and
a rough idea of the timeframe and process for introducing these changes
into the mainstream. I haven't visted the W3O pages recently, but that
is probably the right place for tracking this type of information.

Actually it does sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.  The server line is

ARG!  What's with the 2-byte lengths!?

Why in the world would you limit packets to 64K? To save an extra 2 bytes 
per packet? This means I *have* to chop up files even if I know in 
advance they'll fit.  Let's not revert to PDP-11 mindset, shall we?

(Not that they'd put "close" in the header of the man page so you could

Yes, if a single script is responsible then it could decide. I was wondering
how a server is going to handle http://.../cgi-bin/*** for example; does
it give me my cgi-bin directory tree, or call all scripts?

EHr, no, but you need a new browser to handle the multi-part messages
anyway, and as you said this isn't likely to be used directly by
browsers  but by other applications. So I don't see why mehtods would
introduce a problem.

Yes, but you are changing the way URL's are decoded in the Web --
I think this is likely to impact certain uses.

Groan, just as they finalised the draft :-)

I suppose it depends how you think about this facility. Are we talking
about a "meta object" (URL), or about an operation (method)? As we're
talking about protocol here I think the latter is more appropriate.

Hmm ... I'm not sure I understand your terms.  May I make this 
discussion a little more concrete by giving an example?  

I am working on a system concept for technical information 
(documents, objects, ...).  Briefly:  files at specified locations 
would be scanned for a set of specified attributes, which would be 
pulled into an RDBMS server for querying (via HTML forms).  As an 
example of a marked-up technical document, I have a sample failure 
analysis report with some special tags in it at:  

http://epims1.gsfc.nasa.gov/fa/fa.html

Part of the concept is to have a sort of "family" of DTD's for 
technical documents, all of which would include the HTML tag set 
as a subset.  I have not done any DTD's yet.  Details of this 
particular example may be naive ... comments?

We were thinking about modifying the server in any case to give a recursive
directory list. That does not require modifications.


Latest suggestion (author requested anonymity):-

/...

1) Its clean
2) Only backwards bongo is that anyone calling a directory ... will screw
	things.
3) It gets round semantic problems with *

4) ITS COMPATIBLE WITH VMS !!!!

Well the draft is hardly complete in any case. There are no URLs for posting
news. And the gopher URL sucks turkey eggs.

No we are talking about an operation. 


fred/...  	is a directory listing (no client update, server update)
fred/.../* 	is a compound object (lots of new software)

OK I may accept that MGET should be required for fred/.../* but for fred/...
we are talking GET because only one object will be reteurnethed unto the
client.

	Chill,  Darren. 
 
	I don't think he really meant to limit  packets  to 64K, 
rather,  segments  (yeah ... that's the word ... yeah  "segments"). 
 
	I have reasons that would make me prefer the 2-byte length. 
But the suggestion en-whole  (zero length segment terminates,  2-byte 
length,  all of it)  solves exactly  >one<  problem.   Were we to add 
real structure to the stream,  we'd need something more complete.

I'll reply to this later - meanwhile here's a copy of the SCP session 
control protocol I proposed on the IETF working list a while back.

Simon
------

Session Control Protocol (SCP)
------------------------------

Several heavily used Internet applications such as  FTP, GOPHER, and
HTTP use a protocol model in which every transaction requires a separate
TCP connection. Since clients normally issue multiple requests to the 
same server, this model is quite inefficient, as it incurs all the connection
start up costs for every single request.

SCP is a simple protocol which lets a server and client have multiple 
conversations over a single TCP connection. The protocol is designed to be
simple to implement, and is modelled after TCP.

Services.
---------

SCP's main service is dialogue control. This service allows either end of the
connection to establish a virtual session over a single transport connection.
SCP also allows a sender to indicate message boundaries, and allows a reciever
to reject an incoming session.

Design goals.
-------------

	o Unconfirmed service without negotiation. 

	  SCP allows data to be sent with the session establishment; the 
	  recepient does not confirm successful connection establishment, but 
	  may reject unsuccessful attempts. This simplifies the design of the
	  protocol, and removes the latency required for a confirmed operation.

	o Low overhead

 	  SCP has a fixed overhead of 8 bytes per segment. This overhead is 
	 half the size of an IPNG address, and is only incurred once per 
	 segment, instead of once per packet.

	o Simple design

	  The session protocol should be simple enough to implement for a 
	 single application.

Protocol Operation:
-------------------

Session ID allocation.

Each session is allocated a session identifier. Session Identifiers below
1024 are reserved. Session IDs allocated by clients are  even; those allocated
by servers, odd. 

Session establishment.

A session is established by setting the SYN bit in the first message sent on
that channel. 

Graceful release.

A session is ended by sending a message with the FIN bit set. Each end of a 
connection may be closed independently.

Disgraceful release.

A session may be terminated by sending a message with the RST bit set. All
pending data for that session should be discarded

Message boundaries.

A message boundary is marked by sending a message with the PUSH bit set. The
boundary is set at the final octet in this message, including that octet.

	I'd avoid putting state information after the question mark. 
Some clients will strip it in some cases/places.   A better place for 
state information is between the question mark and a preceeding comma 
or semi-colon,  like  
 
	http://foo.bar/cgi-bin/access,file=baz.html+session_key=SK?... 
 
> I assume that similar things have been done.  Does anyone have any pointers?
 
	Yes.   Look at 
 
	http://vm.rice.edu/local/problem,list?assignee=troth&status=open 
 
	Its "links" will have a  ",read"  instead of a  ",list". 
Here,  the state information is whether you're listing a range of problem 
records or examining a single problem record.

Subject: HTTP format negotiation
Date: Thu, 15 Sep 1994 11:39:43 -0700
From: Joe English <jenglish@crl.com>
content-length: 1089


Two questions regarding HTTP format negotiation:
(I remember this being asked before, but don't recall
the answer.)

1) How should a server respond to a GET request 
   for an object which it cannot supply in any
   of the formats listed in the Accept: request 
   header?  E.g., suppose the server can provide 
   /pictures/foo as image/tiff and image/jpeg,
   what should it do with

	GET /pictures/foo HTTP/1.0
	Accept: image/gif

2) Is there any way for a client to find out what 
   content types are available for a given URL?
   E.g., is there a header field that works like
   Available-Formats: in the following:

	HEAD /pictures/foo HTTP/1.0

	HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	Server: hypothetical/1.0
	Available-Formats: 
		image/jpeg; length=45530; q=0.8,
		image/tiff; length=120132; q=1.0
	Last-Modified: Thursday, 08-Sep-94 12:00:00 GMT
    

3) Do any existing clients or servers actually implement
   format negotiation as described in the HTTP spec?


The gopher+ protocol handles format negotiation nicely.
This is an area where HTTP seems lacking.

John,

   Hello, this is Gina Faber from Teknowledge.  I saw this post
in www-talk, and was looking forward to seeing people's response,
as I don't know of anyone ever trying what you proposed.  Could
you do me the favor of filling me in on the responses, conclusions?
or post them back to the list?

   Also, are you planning on attending the Chicago WWW conference
in October?  I'm going, and since I'll be alone, it would be nice
to know that I'll know at least one other person there by face.

							Gina

Not to discourage you from pursuing this, looks like a good thing. 
However based on a quick cursory look, it seems some of the concepts 
like "session ID's", "Low Overhead", etc...are already designed into 
RTPv2. There are several reference RTP implementations available as 
well. So....

More detailed info on RTPv2 is available from:
	http://www.eit.com/techinfo/mbone/references.html
(look for RTPv2)

Enjoy,

Yeah; "segment" is a better word than "packet".

I thought a 2-byte segment length was reasonable because
typically a server process is going to use a small (< 64K)
buffer *anyway* as it's sending data over the network -- a
program that reads a 4 megabyte file into memory and writes
it back out with only two system calls is going to have
problems -- and this also provides a reasonable maximum
buffer size for clients to allocate.

My first thought was to use a 3 part tag-length-value
encoding for segments/packets, but I couldn't think of any
uses for the tag field.  

This scheme is only trying to solve one problem --
how to provide an in-band end-of-message indicator for
multipart MIME messages without "spreading social diseases
like base64 encoding around" :-) What other structure do you 
have in mind?

Can anyone point me to any of several HTML-oriented programs?

Something UNIXish, running batchly, that would convert HTML to 
nicely-formatted text and/or to postscript?  Something like what Mosaic's 
save-as menu option does, only non-interactively?

Can someone recommend a program to turn directories into HTML, like what 
NCSA httpd server does, only as a separate program?

How about one to take a MIME message and turn it into an HTML document? 
I.e., for a multipart, put the images into separate files and put <IMG> 
tags in, and things like that?

(BTW, all these have to be UNIXy for now.)

Thanks for any pointers!    -- Darren

I have had a few private responses. None took up the challege
of what could be done in a class. All of them told me 
about the NCSA httpd .htaccess process and that the cgi-bin
scripts could look at REMOTE_USER to get the name of the person.
You can use the hidden input tool to pass the information
between pages. 

But the key is that you are always running a cgi-bin script
that uses an HTML page to pass parameters to the next script. 
Without that focus, it is hard.

We did think up a way to use dynamically created directories, but
I think that it is unstable.

Perhaps not. Perhaps it looks at the actual size of the file it will be 
sending, allocates a buffer that large, sucks it in, writes it out, and 
away you go. I use programs that work this way all the time.

Why? I do it all the time. Why do you think OS's are using the VM manager 
to manage persistant-file I/O also? Why not map the file into memory and 
then squirt it back out a chunk at a time? If it's bigger then 64K, 
you're going to need multiple writes for each segment to do it this way, 
even if it's the most efficient way of moving files onto the network 
otherwise.

>-- and this also provides a reasonable maximum

You can still allocate whatever buffer size you want. If you allocate a 
64k buffer when your segments are only 4K long, you're going to be 
wasting space too. If you allocate a 64K buffer and get a 128K segment, 
you'll need to do two reads. But then, that's OK, because you'd be "having 
problems" anyway.

In HTTP/1.1, MGET is good (done in a single session(!)).  But people

[aside: for many web sites in the past, CPU time _has_ been the bottleneck]

There is no need to parse each document every time you need to find out what
images it references. The load set can be generated lazily by parsing the 
document the first time it's referenced when changed, or using a dynamic 
approach, a log module could be pushed to generate load-sets based on a 
the documents retrieved  in a virtual session.

Generating composite mime documents is not the ideal way to solve this
problem, since it causes real hardship for streamed documents whose size
is not known until the transaction is complete.

The simple way (assuming NCSA HTTPd server)

Use a .htaccess file in a cgi-bin subdirectory to require passwords
from the users - then use the returned CGI variable REMOTE_USER
to find the right mail address.

In short: in /cgi-bin/quiz
File: .htaccess

    AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/quiz/.htstudents
    AuthGroupFile /dev/null
    AuthName Student
    AuthType Basic

    <Limit GET POST>
    order deny,allow
    require valid-user
    </Limit>

File: .htstudents (must be set up before class starts)

    student1: 12EWRJHWq!
    student-two: 3Hhjdiudua
    etc etc...

Then set up you quiz program in this directory - the first access 
will cause a password prompt, and after that point the student logs
in and the scripts have access to the REMOTE_USER variable as a
simple 'signature' - granted the security of this setup is really
low, but should be adequate for the needs of a classroom.

Oh - you might want to check the contrib directory at NCSA for CGI
scripts to allow students to change their passwords through the web
too..

Because it provides the time that the server "thinks" is the right time --
that has an effect on the Last-modified date and also lends a clue as to
which date format/time zone the server is using.  Both of these are unnecessary
if the client is directly connected to the server and the connection is
working properly, but that is not always the case.

For example, think of what happens when we have a two-tiered cache
hierarchy.  The cache closest to the origin server will know the date from
when it requested that document from its origin.  However, the cache 
below it only knows when it connected to the cache above (getting the
cached copy there) and whatever is enclosed in the message.  If the message
contains a Date header, it can tell from that header how "old" is the message.
This is important because there are many applications which require a
window of "timeliness," and this is the only way to guarantee that
timeliness without doing a "Pragma: no-cache" on all requests.

The other reason for having it is to maintain a proper rfc822/MIME message
which can be gatewayed through to mail, netnews, etc. without changing
the message.  Since that is one of the main reasons we are passing around
text headers, it is a bit silly to leave them off.

Yes it is -- it's in the HTTP2.html spec, which is the only one that
currently specifies the HTTP/1.0 protocol.  I guess it's time to correct
that situation.

Yes, I have read the technical specs and the main article on Hyper-G.
Although it looks like a fine system (and may be ideal for many environments),
I do not believe it will scale as well as the WWW has, nor does it support
out-of-context referencing as well as URLs do.

Although the defficiencies with the MDMA server would not have occurred
with Hyper-G, that is only because Hyper-G is much more fragile than WWW
(i.e. it would have fallen on its face, or just refused requests, rather
than allowing the most common requests to succeed) and also has a much
more definitive specification of the protocol than we have for HTTP. 

On balance, we are much better off with a loosely-coupled system like WWW. 
Simon is a great guy (I'm sorry my original message was so harsh) and I am
very confidant that MDMA will eventually be a full-featured, fully-compliant
HTTP server.

While it is true that some documents are like that (and thus being able to
handle MIME multipart type objects is a good thing), the fact is that most
inline images are document-independent (company logos, up, next, prev arrows,
mail box icons, stupid colored dots, etc.) which may be associated with many
different documents on a server.  Using multipart to package these would be
a disaster.

I agree.

True, but I don't think that will change any time soon (or at least not
until we add their semantic equivalents to HTML).  I am certain that
people will always use logos as document headers.

This is still not necessarily the case.  An image may be used by any number
of documents, regardless of whether or not the original author knows it is
being used that way.  Although this might be an interesting method of
preventing people from reusing your images, it is still a bad idea in general.

And how are you supposed to know if I decide to create a local HTML document
which uses inline images from CERN?  Similarly, if you change the text of a
document, but not the image, why should a cache-refresh be necessary for both?

No, <uri>.mget is just a single URI -- the list would be contained within
the object pointed to by that URI.

That's a pretty major difference in my book.  What you are talking about
is a different method, and thus I would agree with Martijn's comments.

? HTTP is quite useful without any notion of security in the protocol.
Now, there is no reason why the content can't be (somewhat) more secure
(e.g. encrypted), but that has little to do with HTTP.  True security requires
a secure connection, and if you are going to do that, there is no reason to
use HTTP (a stateless protocol which passes rfc822/MIME messages around)
when it is far more efficient to use a stateful, binary (or ASN.1) protocol
that passes compressed and encrypted messages.

However, that is just my opinion.  Since I don't use secure services with
WWW, I have no need for security features in HTTP.  I would still like to
see how others would implement such a system -- just don't call it HTTP
until a proven implementation exists which acts like HTTP.  It is my 
"intuition" that no stateless protocol which passes rfc822/MIME messages
around can be truly secure, so why not separate the two needs into two
different protocols?

OK so we are on segments.

I thought that 4Gb was a bit low myself. 4Mb fills are well within the

I agree this has more potential. Perhaps we should take the discussion

The session stuff is good except that maybe we don't need it. The multipart
mime can give that functionality. Are we trying to replace the multipart
stuff as well?

I think we should continue to work within the framework of RFC 822 until we 
have the code in such a manner as we can create a binary correspondence of the
protocol. I do not want to have two divergent specs. We want one spec with two 
flavours - RFC-822 and a binary (ASN.1) equivalent. The binary spec would
start off being used as a client/proxy protocol but could spread to
more widespread use gradually.

Joe,

Why don't you develop the segment idea into a MIME Content-encoding
type, e.g. Content-encoding: x-stream

Rather than a binary value for the segment length, I think we need
an ascii representation to avoid big-endian/little-endian problems.
I propose the number is represented as a string of one or more
digits from '0' to '9' terminated with a '\0' character. This is
followed by the corresponding number of octets (bytes).

This could then be combined with the keep connection pragma. One issue
to be resolved would be how x-stream would interact with say x-compress
or x-gzip. Perhaps we could allow multiple Content-encoding headers where
the receiving process applies the corresponding decode operation in the
order the Content-encoding headers appear in the MIME header.

If you are truly talking about information (HTTP server statistics, Internet 
address lists, # of telephones by country, etc.), it is far too fluid to 
easily be constrained by (1) or (2).  The legal protections for information 
are few.  If they were not, almanac publishers would be out of business. 
 The expressions of information (like a particular almanac, William Gibson's 
latest novel, etc.) are much more strongly protected under law.  If you 
abuse your rights to copy these items, the publishers have the legal clout 
to protect themselves from you.

Programs are just one type of information, with the added ability to protect 
themselves ("active information").  As someone who spent many hours working 
on copy-protection schemes, I can tell you from experience that it is just 
not possible to protect information 100%, even when it can defend itself 
(like programs can).  "Passive information" just doesn't have a chance. 
 Strangely enough, the "value-added" from legally dealing with the company 
that manufactured the software has been enough motivation to people that the 
software industry did not collapse and die when copy-protection pretty much 
died off in the PC world, despite the predictions of some software 
manufacturers.

It is not possible to protect information on paper 100% (although copying is 
lots more expensive!) -- let's not kid ourselves that we can obtain 100% 
protection in cyberspace.

First: I like Phillip Hallam-Baker's idea of MIME multipart/mixed 
implemented via multiple Content-Length headers.  It is clean and fast.

Secondly, the fuss about processing time for MIME using boundaries I think 
is misplaced.  Unless I miss my guess, the processing time constraints on 
the Web are chiefly on the server side, esp. if the client sends a proper 
list of Accept headers on initial requests (which does force clients that 
want to save documents in client-unrecognized formats to disk to re-run the 
request).  On the server end, adding boundaries to MIME messages should only 
take a single system call per boundary instance.

We are running an HTTP server on an NT machine, and have a number of CGI

script (an NT console-app) to be able to send Internet email in this 
context, not least for server-maintenance purposes.  The options I can think 
of are:

1) linking in some library code from somewhere,
2) exec'ing a DOS/NT-console command-line eMail utility, or
3) some `natural' way of doing this I haven't thought of re. the HTTP server.

Any suggestions gratefully received by private eMail (sorry if this is a

Incidentally the Internet mail clients we have are Eudora, Pegasus Mail, Elm.

Not that this is directly germain to your comment, but one way that
would improve performance of both http and ftp would be if IP
implementations would make use of MTU discovery.  It is still the case
that many Suns (and similar beasts from other vendors) still use an
MTU of about 560 when sending off the local subnet.

I agree too or have an other way to profile at running or compile time
(not good) the errors message. I don't want edit the source code of the

Don't give up yet.  There are lots of ways to handle indeterminate
length input.  My favorite is to "chunk" the stream so that it comes
as a sequence of determinate length segments.  (One can almost always
know how long each intermediate chunk is, i.e. the size of the
transmit buffer in the absence of any other information).

It has a nice ancillary property in that it can allow restart of
broken transmissions of huge items (not that anybody has done that
yet.)

The Date: line should indicate when the document was peeled from the
original content provider.  If a cache intervenes, it should not
change the Date: line.  Thus there may be a substantial difference
between the Date: as published and the time of document reception.

Do caching servers add there own headers before passing along the document?
I hope so.  As with mail it should be possible from the header to learn
through whose hands a document has passed on the way to the client.  Also
each caching server should add a Date-cached: header similar to the mail
Received: header.

If this is done there really isn't much reason for having a Date: 
header from the original server (the Last-Modified-Date: is analogous
to the Date: in mail).  On the other hand it isn't very expensive 
either.

I see I should have added the sentence I had thought about adding on making 
the extraction of the plain text arbitrarily hard...

What I was trying to convey was that no scheme will be 100% effective. 
 However, I expect schemes that require "large" amounts of computing power 
to overcome will be acceptable to most publishers.  "rot13" is unlikely to 
be used by serious publishers; some kind of public-key system will work 
quite well until the factoring problem is solved (if it can be solved at 
all).

It will take careful program design to create readers/browsers that cannot 
easily be made to save away the now-decrypted data.  "Arbitrarily hard", 
once again...

David, Your separation of this problem into two issues isn't really
instructive nor necessary. First you ask if a publisher's product can be
protected in digital form and then you ask how one possible mode of attack
on the first problem might prove useful. 

Better to ask if we can -- using technology -- protect intellectual
property in digital form and leave it at that, because the answer is very
simply that we cannot. 

To better understand this problem, we need to look at how we protect
intellectual property in the real world. 

(Please keep in mind throughout that I am talking exclusively about a
technological solution.  This is an important point since I intend to show
that there can be no technological solution to this problem.  Also, where 
I use the term publisher, please also assume I refer to the author.)

If I write a book and have it published, I am protected against many forms
of use which do not compensate me for my labors.  

The casual thief, the one who duplicates a magazine article and shares it
with others in the office, cannot be protected against, simply because the
costs to do so would far outweigh the benefits gained. 

But the inveterate thief, the mass-scale thief, the thief who represents a
concentrated loss of value to the publisher must be protected against and 
there really is only one technological protection available to us:  

	the physical characteristics of the medium in which the 
	author chooses to publish. 

It is a non-trivial expense to produce and print a book with any real
exposure, more than a very few copies.  The cost of printing 50,000 copies
of anything is out of reach to most but those few companies which publish
as a business.

Since a book has measurable dimensions and weight, and thus occupies
space, it must be physically transported from publisher to consumer in
some fashion.  This is distribution and is another major cost in the
provision of books. 

So, the costs involved here are reflections of the fact that a book is
made of paper, ink, glue, and binding materials, and that it takes up
space and must be transported.   And it is these costs which indirectly 
protect the publisher from most intellectual property theft.

But, none of this has anything to do with the information contained in the
book -- its intellectual content.  This is why I believe that our 
protections of intellectual property in the real world are all based on 
characteristics of the medium and not on any characteristic of the 
information itself.

On the global Internet, and on other forms of digital communications, the 
costs of distributing information are extremely small in comparison to 
the real world, and since the costs of duplication are so small to be 
unmeasurable, we have a big problem.

When I explain this problem in my lectures, I use the statement: "Digital
Information has no Container" and because all of our protections of 
information are based on its container, we are left with the fact that 
there is no technological way to protect information.

Let's look as some examples:

	A book is rendered into digital form and is distributed 
	to the consumer.  

		This is done today but offers no protection to
		the publisher of the book whatsoever.

	The same book is distributed in the same fashion but in an
	encrypted form. The consumer is given the decrypting pass 
	phrase and then views the contents of the book.

		This is also done today and offers minimal protection
		but once the book is in a freely readable form it is
		unprotected.

	The same book is distributed in the same fashion and the
	same encrypted format with special tools to decrypt, browse 
	and read the book. 

		This has been experimented with and might prove 
		moderately useful but only if the consumer is 
		restricted from using the book in any other form.
		The moment the consumer can save a clear copy of
		the book outside of the provided toolset, there 
		is no protection.

	The same book is distributed on special media which can only
	be unlocked by a special physical key, a 'dongle', which the 
	consumer must attach to the viewing computer.

		If we only allow the book to be viewed using the
		publisher's special toolset, we now have protection.
		But in a sense, the dongle becomes the container of
		the information, at least it becomes impossible
		to gain access to the information without it.

Even with all of this, it still does not offer complete protection, 
because we need to have the information in a readable/consumable form for 
it to have any value to us and once it is, it is stealable.

Technology is a marvelously dynamic and slippery thing. A scant moment 
after we design the unbreakable system, someone comes along with a method 
to break it.


---


Ok, now that I have told you why I do not believe that intellectual
property in digital form CAN be protected using technology, I will tell
you what I believe to be the only solution to this problem. 

In its purest sense and accepting my premise of a container for information,
this does not actually protect anything.  It only makes the abuse easy to
track.  Once the publisher is made aware of the abuse of their rights and 
can follow this abuse to its source, the actual protection takes place in a 
court of law.

But online, we can quickly and efficiently distribute hundreds of 
thousands of copies of a copyrighted work and the publisher might never 
be able to track the source of the abuse.

This is the problem.  And the solution, at least in my mind, would appear 
that the publisher needs to take an active role in the online community, 
in its society, in the design of its tools, in every facet of this new 
media because if they do not, they will be put out of business by the 
free and open access to information that this technology represents.

The moment that some "kind" soul scans and places the newest Steven King 
hardcover online for the consumption of the community, all hell is going 
to break loose.

Hi World,
 I'm on a project that uses WWW technology to provide educational
modules about 'Lighting and energy conservation' on a network-wide
basis. 
 As a part of the module, the module user (if I may call him that)
can take a quiz at the end to gauge his/her comprehension of the
module's material. 
 I've written a very, very...very simple CGI script that acts as a 
'automated quiz-master'.
 Take a look at it at:
 	http://snake.cs.iastate.edu:8080/
 It needs lots of additions,improvements but gives a general idea
of how it has been implemented.
 Any comments, suggestions are deeply appreciated !

Thanks,
Vatsa

69.26 	SunSoft Unveils Vision for Solaris Users

	SunSoft, Inc.  announced its vision for a universal document
	viewer for the Solaris(R) operating environment.  This
	next-generation of SunSoft's AnswerBook(TM) technology will,
	for the first time, give Solaris users a single point of access
	to information that they use every day, including
	user-published documents and on-line information from Sun,
	Solaris ISVs and OEMs.  Solaris users will also be able to
	browse and search Internet documents through the same window.
	SunSoft expects to have a prototype of the new AnswerBook
	technology in the fourth quarter of 1994.

	SUNSOFT UNVEILS VISION FOR OPEN, ELECTRONIC ACCESS
		TO INFORMATION FOR SOLARIS USERS

   Next-generation AnswerBook technology opens document access
	    to multiple formats on multiple platforms;
	Enables Internet access with World-Wide-Web browser


In a related announcement also made today, SunSoft has entered into an
agreement with Electronic Book Technologies, Inc. (EBT) to allow Solaris
users, ISVs and OEMs to use EBT's electronic publishing tools and begin
distributing on-line documents that will integrate seamlessly and without
change into SunSoft's universal viewing environment.

"SunSoft's long-term goal is to pull together information that users need --
whether it is published by Sun, ISVs, OEMs, or by customers themselves --
and deliver it through a single viewer," said Steve MacKay, vice-president
of software technology development at SunSoft.  "Essentially, SunSoft is
giving Solaris users easy, one-stop access to the vast universe of on-line
information that resides both within their own company as well as
externally on the Internet."

Within the new universal viewing environment, users and developers can
view, browse and annotate documents in a wide range of formats
including:

%	HTML - the de facto standard for World-Wide-Web data

%	SDL - Common Desktop Environment (CDE) on-line help

%	SGML - IS0 8879 standard for electronic publishing

%	DynaText(TM) -  Electronic Book Technologies' SGML-based
	electronic publishing

%	Portable Document Format (PDF) - the universal file format created
	using Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) software

%	Other formats - Current AnswerBook collections, PostScript and
	ASCII text.

EBT's DynaText Provides Electronic Publishing Foundation
SunSoft will work with EBT to develop an open, standards-based
electronic document delivery technology.  EBT's DynaText technology,
which is based on SGML, provides the architectural foundation, and
enables the interchange and publishing of documents from many different
authoring systems.  SunSoft's agreement with EBT allows for use of EBT's
DynaText publishing tools throughout Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Using tools available from EBT today, Solaris users, software vendors and
OEMs can create and publish complete on-line documentation
immediately.  EBT's DynaText technology is currently used by computer
software and hardware vendors such as Cray Research, Ericsson, and
Sybase, end-user companies such as AT&T, The Boeing Company, and
information publishers such as RR Donnelley & Co.  Users will be able to
access these documents within SunSoft's universal viewing environment,
which will be part of a future version of the Solaris operating
environment.  EBT's DynaText technology fully supports cross-
platform publishing and viewing on the Solaris environment, other
UNIX(R) platforms and X terminals, as well as Microsoft(R)
Windows(TM) and Apple Macintosh(R) systems.

World-Wide-Web
SunSoft's next-generation AnswerBook viewing environment will also
include access to documents available on the World-Wide-Web, such as
Sun and ISV product literature, press releases and technical white papers.
Information publishers will be able to publish documents on the World-
Wide-Web, and using SunSoft's universal viewing environment, users will
be able to access these documents seamlessly.

that is not the goal. The goal is to be able to tell the browser (!) what
do do when a specific link does return an error message
(be it permission denied, authorization failer, host unreachable or whatever
the document writer happens to expect for this specific(!) link)

This is semantically identical to the "Pragma: keep-alive" idea, with
the addition of tacking a content-length onto the pragma. It's an
improvement because it looks like MIME.

If you're going to MIMEify it, then do it all as MIME:

	Content-Encoding: x-stream; length=<digits>

with a newline (or a semicolon) to terminate the length.

I suggest you look through the MIME archives. This kind of things was
rejected there for good reason. If you need this, send a MULTIPART
mime document with one part. The container has Content-type: x-stream,
the contained part gets Content-Type: x-gzip or whatever.

Clearly, the next version of HTTP needs real protocol negotiation.
Something like the telnet DO/DON't WILL/WON'T protocols, so that
adding minor new capabilities can happen without having to rev the
protocol number.

Actually, the exact opposite is true.  Pragma: Keep-connection is 
easier to do and solves the problem today (including backward 
compatability).  MGET does not work today and requires significant 
changes on both the server and client.  In addition, Pragmas provide 
real protocol negotiation, something that is sorely lacking in HTTP.

I still think MGET is good and should be added AS LONG AS IT'S DONE IN 
A SINGLE SESSION!!  Let's not design inefficiences into the protocol.  
Note that with Pragma: Keep-connection, it could be used with MGET to 
easily achieve the single session behaviour for servers/clients that 
support it.

Definitely.  Additionally, a little sign in the gui somewhere to the 
effect of "you are authenticated as user *blah* on this page" - so that 
people can tell when that info is being sent and when it isn't.  I 
consider it nothing more than luck that most browsers are currently 
intelligent enough to not send authentification information for one site 
to another by default.

Several people have attacked my original message because I dared to
question if we can protect information rendered in digital form.

The information may be text, audio, video, or images.  Indeed, it
might be a hologram.  After pointing out quite clearly that you cannot
do this, I suggested that we can make it inconvenient for people who
want to duplicate this information.  But since it is not possible to
truly stop people from duplicating information, I then asked what
efforts exist to "watermark" information such that we can know who is
the offending distributor.

Now, I want to be clear.  I am not interested in generating discussion
about how business should be conducted.  Nor am I passing value
judgements on any particular stance.  While I think we must be open to
looking at all facets of the problem, I am really only interested in
the technical discussion that pertains to marking data.  So, please
accept that I will not reply to messages that attempt to engage me in
some sort of philosophical debate of what is right and what is wrong.

I doubt very seriously that book sales would be impacted by such an
occurence because virtually nobody really wants to read a Steven King
novel (or any other work of substantial length) online.  They want it
online so it can be indexed and searched and referenced.  IMHO this would
serve to increase printed sales of the material not to mention *vastly*
increasing the value of information and our society (yes, I really believe
that).

Even if a text was available online I believe that most people would go
down to the bookstore and buy a copy to read if they wanted to read it.
*Assuming* they didn't have to buy it twice (once online and once hardcopy)!

Sales of certain types of books (mainly reference books) would probably
be affected by publication online but the vast majority would not.  Even
so, I seriously doubt that it would make very much difference except in
cases where the printed material is overpriced creating a demand for
black-market goods (and in that case the free market will probably have
made a wise choice :-).

But you are right, if someone started scanning in texts and posting them
around the net it would drive publishers nuts :-)

     Not really a quiz program, but: I wrote a translator to convert files in
Eric Lechner's purity test format (each question gets a yes/no answer) to html,
and a program to 'grade' submissions.  I translated all of the tests that came
with EL's package & put the up at http://www.armory.com/tests/purity.html
(and wrote one myself, the 'pyro' test).

In that case, why not just use 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'
and require 'Content-Length:' to be accurate?

The binary-segmented encoding addresses cases where
the server doesn't know in advance how large the
object is.  It lets the server send data one chunk
at a time instead of having to buffer the whole thing.

[It might also be used to allow clients to prematurely
terminate transmission of an object without shutting
down the entire session, but I don't know if that's
really an issue.]


----

To summarize:  In order to implement an MGET 
method, or to keep HTTP connections open for multiple
requests, there must be an in-band mechanism to delimit 
the end of a transmitted object.  Some options:

1. Use multipart/* and BASE64 encoding.
2. Use multipart/* and BINARY encoding, and
   send an accurate content length in the header.
3. Use multipart/* and a new, binary, self-delimiting encoding.
4. Throw out MIME altogether and use ASN.1 over BER or PER.
5. Throw out MIME altogether and use something totally new.

(1) is believed to be expensive in terms of CPU and network 
    transmission time.
(2) requires that the server know the content length before
    it begins transmitting.
(3) has not been invented yet.
(4) adds a lot of extra complexity for very little payoff.
    (Before I get flamed for this: ASN.1 is great for complex 
    data structures, but the data on the web just isn't that 
    complex.  MIME content-types have been sufficient so far,
    and probably will be in the future.)


I'm in favor of (3).

Data structures using ASN.1 and the PER are in many ways ideal for 
a high performance HTTP protocol; however they perform a completely 
different role to that of mime types. MIME typing is a notation designed to
indicate the type of an object carried within an envelope; mime also allows
a mail message to contain multiple objects through the multipart hack, but this
is orthogonal to its object typing role.

Using a proper presentation layer such as ASN.1/PER allows several major
optimisations to be performed. For example, Type perferences can be represented
as an ordered sequence of bit sets, allowing object type negotiaion to be
performed with just mask and match, many orders of magnitude faster than
processing 1K of object headers. A properly designed protocol can also take
advantage of PER to indicate multiple options, such as request for headers only
and checkout locks in a regular and orthogonal way, vastly simplifying te
design.

No, the mechanism in the current encoding scheme just isn't being used

So am I, especially when you consider that the only objection is an

There are several reasons, which I outlined in a prior message.  Perhaps
most important, however, is that the whole reason we are passing all these
inefficient text headers around is so that the message is a valid
rfc822/MIME message and can thus be passed on to various mail and news
gateways without changing the format.  The Date: header is a REQUIRED
header for rfc822.

Yes, clients and caching proxies and cache managers and gateways can all
be hacked to parse all the headers and, if no Date is present, tack on one
of their own.  But why should they?  The server is at fault for sending
an invalid message -- it should be fixed.

It would also make Tim B-L very very unhappi. The whole point of HTTP is
to exploit being 8 bit clean. We do not want the smallest toehold for the

ASN.1 has a different place, for sending raw data arroung for later analysis.
But there are some bits that look usefull.

|>I'm in favor of (3).

Seconded.


How about a compromise on the length. We start out with a four byte length
field BUT we reserve one whole byte of it. Then we can add in session 
m'larkey at a later date in any manner we chose. :-

Byte 0: Tag byte

Case byte 0 is 0:
Byte 1: B1 MSB
Byte 2: B2
Byte 3: B3 LSB
< B1 * 256^2 + B2 * 256 + B3 Bytes>


Case byte 0 is not 0
Byte 1: Stream id }  Semantics defined by byte 0
Byte 2: Stream id }
Byte 3: Length of header block

Byte 4:
Byte 5:
Byte 6:
Byte 7:
< B3 Bytes of header >
< B4 * 256 ^3 + B5 * 256^2 + B6 * 256 + B7 Bytes>


The semantics of the B1 and B2 fields would be determined by context. For
most cases B3 would be 0 and there would be no `object header'. 16 bits
for a stream tag sounds OK. There can be up to 255 stream modes, the
streams may have data object attachments and there isn't a base 64 
encoding anywhere. 


I would propose that an area of the byte 0 field be reserved for development
and an area be allowed for experimental use 0 to 191 reserved OK?



BTW on the subject of Base 64 am I in any danger if I include <STDlib.h>
in my programs?

I wonder how having the PostScript drafts of John Ousterhout's reference
book ``Tcl and the Tk Toolkit'' freely available has affected sales for
Addison-Wesley?  My guess (and it is just a guess) is that it either
hasn't effected them at all, or has even improved sales.  Why?  Because I
used the PostScript draft extensively before the book was published and I
still do.  But I got the book as soon as I could because it was nice to
have the full index there (which wasn't in the draft) and to be able to
read it where I currently can't easily read an electronic version (on my
Mac for example :-) ).  Brent Welch is doing likewise with his new book. 

So maybe all this talk of copy protection and encryption, etc is a bit of
smoke screen if free distributing the information in one format helps the
sales of the same  (or similar) information in another format.

Well that's a good reason.  I'm persuaded.  Now maybe you can persuade
the spec writers.  I note that the current HTTP spec at
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html>
is quite explicit: the Date header is optional.  And until the HTTP spec is
changed maybe "broken" is a little strong as an adjective to describe
servers which don't supply a Date header.

While we're on the topic of servers complying with the HTTP/1.0 spec
let me raise another issue.  The document cited above is quite
explicit in saying that the status line (i.e. the first line) of the
server response must end with CR/LF and not just LF.  Presumably the
same is true for other response headers; it is explicitly stated for
all request headers.  Anyway NCSA httpd terminates header lines with
only LF.  I haven't checked other servers.  Does anyone care?  Does it
make any difference.

It's apparently a fairly common practice to do so.  The examples I have
heard are mapmapkers who put in false towns or slightly change the
height of mountains.  That way copying becomes pretty obvious.

In software, I put in little bugs (ones that aren't normally triggered.)

Yes, it does make the "information" a bit less accurate, but not
significantly less so.

Just a bit of history -- ASN.1 came from X.409 which was used as the
presentation for the wrapper and contents of the potentially
multi-media X.400 mail system definition.

So it shouldn't be too surprising to find that it is a useful tool for
a high performance HTTP.  (And it's indefinite length encoding might
just solve some other problems discussed on the list.)

(Too bad that X.409 was taken into other, in my opinion, inappropriate
contexts, and thus turned into a joke in many peoples's minds.)

Am I imagining things are do we have some inconsistency about how
servers terminate their header lines?  Out of the side of my eye last
week I think I perceived two major servers (NCSA and CERN) having
different opinions whether to terminate a header line with a simple LF
or a CRLF pair.

As far as I can see, the header lines must comply to the MIME spec and
hence contain a <CRLF> as a line break. This is also what the CERN
server does.

Quick overview of ASN.1, BER, and PER; I really need to write a proper
tutorial. If people like, I could run off a few slides for the conference
in Chicago.

ASN.1 is a notation for describing data structures; it's very much
like a type declaration in C or C++. Let's start with a C++ structure and 
create the appropriate ASN.1 Data structure. I'll use a simplified form of
the the GET request from FHTTP to start with.


struct GetRequest {
   int headerOnly;            // flag: do we only want headers?
   int lock;                  // flag: should we checkout the object?
   string url;	              // the url to fetch
   AcceptTypes* acceptTypes;  // Optional list of accept types that only apply
	                      // to this request
};

struct AcceptTypes {
  List<bitset>* standardTypes;      // list of bitmaps indicating which
				    // preference order for standard types
  List<string>* otherTypes;         // nonstandard types in preference order
};


GetRequest ::= [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
	headerOnly BOOLEAN,
	lock       BOOLEAN,
        acceptTypes AcceptTypes OPTIONAL
	url  OCTET STRING,

}

AcceptTypes ::= [APPLICATION 1] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
	standardTypes [0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING 
		    {html(0),plain-text(1),gif(2), jpeg(3)} OPTIONAL,

	otherTypes [1] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
}

For the encoding examples, we'll use the following example. (the notation for
the test case is a little lispy. If that makes you uncomfortable, just thing
of it as a wais source :-)

(GetRequest 
	    :headerOnly TRUE 
	    :lock FALSE 
	    :acceptTypes (AcceptTypes 
			    :standardTypes ((html) 
					    (plain-text)))
	    :url "/ses/magic/moxen.html")

-----
The Basic Encoding Rules (BER) were the orignal rules for taking an
ASN.1 data type, and turning it into a sequence of bits and bytes. BER uses
a form of encoding commonly known as Tag-Length-Value. Each item is encoded as 
a tag, indicating what type it is, a length indicating the size of the object,
and a value, which contains the actual contents of the object. 

Tags are reasonably simple - in there simplest form they consist of a single 
byte; the highest two bits indicate the tag class (whether the tag is an 
official ISO tag, an application wide tag, a private tag, or a tag that only
has meaning for this particular structure. The next bit is a flag to indicate
whether the tagged object is a simple type, such as a number or a string, 
or a compound type made up from a bunch of other types. The remaining 5 bits
are used to represent the tag number. If the tag is too big to fit in 5 bits,
then these bits are set to all ones, and the tag number is encoded in the
following bytes as a sequence of seven bit bytes. The high bit of these
bytes is used as a flag to indicate whether there's more tag available.

Lengths are also quite simple. There are two ways of encoding lengths - 
the definite form, and the indefinite form. 

For the definite form, if the length is less than 128, you just use a single
byte, with the high bit set to zero. Otherwise the high bit is set to one,
and the low seven bits set to the length of length. The length is then
encoded in that many bytes.

The indefinite form is encoded by sending a length field with a length of 
length of 0 - i.e. [1000|0000]. The object is ended by sending two 
zero bytes.

Here's our test case encoded using the BER

0x60 		-- [0110|0000], [APPLICATION 0, Compound] - GetRequest
0x80            -- [1000|0000], Indefinite length

   0x01		   -- [0000|0001], [BOOLEAN]  GetRequest.headerOnly
   0x01		   -- [0000|0001], length 1
   0x01            -- [0000|0001], value TRUE

   0x01		   -- [0000|0001], [BOOLEAN]  GetRequest.lock
   0x01            -- [0000|0001], length 1
   0x00            -- [0000|0000]  value FALSE

   0x61		   -- [0110|0001], [APPLICATION 1, Compound] - GetRequest.types
   0x80		   -- indefinite length

	0xa0	   -- [1010|0000], [CONTEXT 0, Compound] types.standardTypes
	0x80	   -- indefinite length
	
	   0x03    -- [0000|0011]  [BIT STRING]
	   0x02	   -- length 2
	   0x04    -- Four bits unused
	   0x80    -- [1000|0000]  {html}
   
	   0x03    -- [0000|0011]  [BIT STRING]
	   0x02	   -- length 2
	   0x04    -- Four bits unused
	   0x40    -- [0100|0000]  {plain-text}

	0x00
	0x00       -- End of list of standard Types
   0x00
   0x00            -- End of Accept Types

   0x04		   -- [0000|0100], [OCTET STRING] GetRequest.url
   0x16		   -- [0001|0110], length 22
   [/ses/magic/moxen.html]  -- value

0x00 
0x00               -- End of get request

[50 bytes total], 22 url
---------------

The packed encoding rules use a different style of encoding. Instead of 
using a generic style of encoding that encodes all types in a uniform way,
the PER specialise the encoding based on the data type to generate  much more
compact representations. 

PER only generates tags when they are needed to prevent ambiguity- this 
only occurs when ASN.1's version of union is used (CHOICE). PER also only
generates lengths when the size of an object can vary. Even then, PER tries
to represent the lengths in the most compact form possible. 

PER encodings are not always aligned on byte boundaries- if the 'aligned' 
variant of the rules is used, then strings *will* be aligned - otherwise
the encoding is treated as a string of bits, allowing things like booleans
and small integers to be squished together in one byte. 

The presence of optional elements in a sequence is indicated by a list of
single bit flags placed at the start of a sequence - if the bit is set, then
the option is present. 


Here's what our test case looks like in PER. 

[1]	-- flag bit indicates acceptTypes is present
[1]     --  boolean, header only, TRUE
[0]     --  boolean, lock,        FALSE
  [1]        -- flag bit, indicates standardTypes is present
  [0]        -- flag bit, indicates otherTypes is absent
  [000]      -- pad bits to make length octet aligned
  [00000010] -- length of 2, -- 2  standardType bit strings to follow
      [1000]     -- the first bit string, html is set
      [0100]     -- the second bit string, plain-text is set
[00010110]       -- length 22; url is 22 octets long
/ses/magic/moxen.html -- value of url

[total size is 26, 22 url]

In this case, the PER are about twice as compact as the BER. If I had chosen
a shorter URL, such as /, the difference would have been even greater -
BER, 29; PER, 5, for a ratio of over 5-1.

Karl, that is not watermarking information.  As I interpret the term, 
watermarking implies some form of identification carried along *with* 
information, not as a modification to it.

Going back to my concept of the container of information for a moment, a 
watermark -- in the real world -- is a characteristic of a document's 
container, ie. paper, not the information in the document.

You are, of course, correct. There is a longstanding tradition of changing
certain data within a document to identify its source but this is usually
only used to prove(?) that published data has been copied.  It does not
identify the copying agent nor the distribution path the copied document
has taken.  There are only so many things a publisher can do (or is
willing to do) using this technique simply because it obscures the value
of the document. 

Watermarking information, if it were possible, would allow each copy of a
document to have its own identifying mark, tuned to the original
recipient, thus providing proof that a certain instance of a document
which was provided to a certain person, was then distributed further. 

Using the technique of injecting error into a document to identify its
origin is only as useful as the limitations of the tools we use to
manipulate it. Many of the tools we currently have empower the user to
make their own presentation decisions -- discarding multiple spaces within
a paragraph, for instance.  While this has not yet been used to change 
the data once it has been retrieved -- perhaps for efficiency sake -- I 
would not consider it completely out of the question.

The only kinds of error we could, I believe, use to track the origination 
of a document would be visible enough to affect the reputation of the
publisher.  I know of no successful publisher that would knowingly
distribute documents with spelling or punctuation errors.

Both are permitted under RFC822 rules. Basically you can't guarantee
that a telnet port will send CRLF or that it will only send LF so both have
to be OK.

It is possible with computers to put different errors into each copy
published and keep a record of (errors, user-copy-sent-to) pairings.

Yes, I agree for text it is hard (perhaps, as you say, impossible) to
put a hidden, non-removable watermark.

My concern is to add something that would be good enough to catch the
dumb copier -- who I claim will be the majority of copiers.  I'm not
looking for something ironclad, rather something that would let unwary
users know that they have violated the rules.  I have enough faith
left to believe that many people will want to follow the rules if the
rules are brought to their attention, the procedures for conpliance
are really easy, and the cost of documents is low.

There seem to have differing opinions on this topic.

It is certainly easy enough to deal with CRLF or simply LF at the
end of most header lines.

Where the ambiguity hits is on the blank line that separates
the header from the binary text.

I would hope that we wouldn't have a situation where the header
ends with something like the following:

Date: xxxxxCRLF
LF
binary stuff...

or 
Date: xxxxxLF
CRLF
binary stuff...

Again, people can live with this, but it is another rock on the
roadway that implementors can trip over.

        There is another way.   Some who code this other way have
become fiends about it.   Whether the "file" is the output of a program
or not,  the server could be coded as a pipeline.   Not everyone wants

        Not all OS's have file-to-memory mapping.   Even when it's

No. But not everyone wants to break it up, either.
By making the length bytes too short, you're preventing people from using 
long lengths. By making the length bytes long enough, I'm not preventing 
you from using short lengths.

But the suggestion that everything be broken into 64K blocks prevents 
that from working.

Nothing I suggested would prevent you from using any methods you
suggested. Your suggestions, however, would prevent me from using the 
methods I suggested.  That's all I'm saying. Just because you have a 
4-byte length field doesn't mean you have to fill it up.

'Nuff said. This is getting way too silly, and I'm pretty sure I've taken 
it to private email several times, only to have the replies resurface here.
Coulda been someone else, tho.

Rob,

It seems that perhaps you misinterpreted what I meant by
"watermarking" data.  I *did* mean that the encoded information would
become part of the data and not just be a header/footer that could be
easily stripped off.  What accomplishes this reasonably for specific
types of data is an open question.  And, how resistant such a mark
would be to tampering is equally unclear.

Work being done at AT&T experiements with shifting lines/words &
manipulating character features to encode a binary signature on a page
of text.  I am more interested in "marking" images, video, and audio.

Sorry if I mislead you,

Dave

Not to disagree, I think we're just mixing issues here because of my sloppy
wording.  The attributes I'm talking about for the HTML header are
*document* attributes.  To the extent that an index entry is a document
attribute, I think it belongs in the header, so that a browser (robot or
human) doesn't have to scan the whole document to decide if it might be
relevant or not.

There's a fundamental problem in indexing (even more so in building key
words) -- the relevant terms to have indexed change over time.  For
example, I'm sure that a lot of news organizations are wishing that there
were sophisticated tags to every reference to Haiti in their archives.

Maybe it's just begging the definition of "meta," but that's pretty much
what I see as belonging in the HTML header.  (I'm saying HTML to be sure to
differentiate it from the HTTP header.)

I didn't mean to imply either manual or automatic replication.  Each has
relevant uses.

Do you want to search on the attributes and the full text?  I'm afraid I
don't really know how other vendors handle this, but we build two indexes
to documents.  One has attributes, which can be anything you want (though
it always includes two that we need) and the other is the full-word index
with a lot of information about words -- where they occur, density, zone,
etc.

But, if you really want to hook this into a relational database, we have
those hooks, too.  You can use our keys to wire to SQL or whatever.  I'm
still learning about what we have, too, but I think the basic difference is
that our attribute file is flat, so if you want the relational
capabilities, that's when you build a gateway via SQL or whatever.

The short, non-product-pitching answer is that it's certainly possible to
combine it all.

One reason you *wouldn't* want to stick attributes into a relational
database would be if you want to do text searching on the fields.  An RDBMS
will get very, very slow if you are searching for text within a field over
lots of records.  But it looks as though your application's fields would be
searched for exact or ordered matches, no?

What's really proposed at this point?

The kind of information that we'll have at first would be things like
author's names (possibly separated into first, last, etc.), date published,
created, maybe even last-modified, even though that's in the HTTP header,
key words...

The debate was between adding lots of new tags similar to <TITLE> or
adopting something like META that would be a more generalized scheme... or
using comments (ugh).  I brought up semantic tagging, but that's overkill
at this point... although we should bear such needs in mind for the future.
How about a scheme that permits directed acyclical graphs?

META looks like this:

<META name="TITLE" value="Rotkaeppchen">
<META name="YEAR" value="1990">

With this sort of scheme, we can just teach our spider to look at the name,
see if it fits an attribute in the index being built and add the value if
it exists (or optionally, create the attribute and enter the value).

I just noticed that back in June when this discussion got hot, someone
suggested that www-html was a better list for discussing it.  I'll
cross-post and let's do the follow-up there.

Well, I generally try to be a bit more forceful than the existing HTTP spec.
The source of all these problems/misunderstandings is that the HTTP spec
was never finished -- when the WWW took off, the specs got left behind
(along with most of the documentation at CERN).

I am willing to volunteer my time toward rewriting/finishing the HTTP/1.0
specification such that it reflects current practice.  However, I don't
want to step on anybody's toes in the process.  Does everybody/anybody
think that I should do this?  One nice thing is that it would allow us
to start talking about HTTP/1.1 as a separate entity.

It may make a difference if people have mistakenly assumed that the lines
are always LF terminated (or always CR/LF terminated) in applications
which interact with those servers.  It is definitely broken and should be
fixed, though it's not an emergency.  One question is -- who will change it?
Is anybody working on the NCSA server now that Rob is at MCom?

I'll send a longer follow-up to www-html, but this needs to be said here.
The syntax for the META element was changed in June for the HTML 2.0 spec.
It is now defined as follows:

META

The meta element is proposed to be used within the head element to
embed document meta-information not defined by other HTML
elements. Such information can be extracted by servers/clients for use
in identifying, indexing, and cataloging specialized document
meta-information.

Although it is generally preferable to use named elements which have
well-defined semantics for each type of meta-information (e.g. title),
this element is provided for situations where strict SGML parsing is
necessary and the local DTD is not extensible.

In addition, HTTP servers can read the content of the document head to
generate response headers corresponding to any elements defining a
value for the attribute HTTP-EQUIV. This provides document authors a
mechanism (not necessarily the preferred one) for identifying
information which should be included in the response headers for an
HTTP request.

The attributes of the meta element are: 

http-equiv 

   This attribute binds the element to an HTTP response header. It
   means that if you know the semantics of the HTTP response header
   named by this attribute, then you can process the contents based on a
   well-defined syntactic mapping, whether or not your DTD tells you
   anything about it. HTTP header names are not case sensitive. If not
   present, the attribute name should be used to identify this
   meta-information and it should not be used within an HTTP response
   header.

name 

   Meta-information name. If not present, the name can be assumed
   equal to the value of http-equiv. 

content 

   The meta-information content to be associated with the given name
   and/or HTTP response header. 

Examples

If the document contains: 

   <expires http-equiv="Expires">Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT</expires>
   <meta http-equiv="Keywords" content="Fred, Barney">
   <meta http-equiv="Reply-to" content="fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)">

the resulting HTTP response headers would be

   Expires: Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT
   Keywords: Fred, Barney
   Reply-to: fielding@ics.uci.edu (Roy Fielding)

when the http-equiv attribute is not present, the server should not
generate an HTTP response header for this meta-information; e.g.,

   <meta name="IndexType" content="Service">

Do not use the meta element to define information that should be
associated with an already existing HTML element. This is an
inappropriate use of the meta element:

   <meta name="Title" content="The Etymology of Dunsel">

Do not name an http-equiv equal to a response header that should
normally only be generated by the HTTP server. Example names that are
inappropriate include "Server", "Date", and "Last-modified" -- the
exact list of inappropriate names is dependent on the particular
server implementation. It is recommended that servers ignore any meta
elements which specify http-equivalents which are equal
(case-insensitively) to their own reserved response headers.

Stealing from PostScript, where the same situation applies (with the Bounding 
Box) when programs are generating the file and writing as they go:

[stuff]
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
Content-Length: (atend)
[lots of stuff]
Content-Length: 12345678

Yes I know this raises other problems, it was just a suggestion. Does the 
program parsing MIME have to know the length at the beginning? Is it OK to know 
it later on, check against how many bytes were recieved, and detect it has got 
them all?

Actually, this is not correct.  RFC822 (and, by extension, MIME) are
very clear that the only legitimate line break is the CRLF pair.  We may
not like it, but it is absolutely true.  In fact, if you have, for
example, two sendmail implementations on two different UNIX machines
talking to each other, the sender translates LF to CRLF, sends it over
the wire, and then the receiver translates CRLF back to LF for local
delivery.  That's really the way it works. 

Now, there's no reason in principle why the Web can't loosen RFC822
restrictions, but it's a slippery slope, and I'm not sure it's worth the
marginal benefits it brings in this case.  At any rate, one should be
clear that the RFC822 rules are in fact quite strict on this matter. --

Subject: An IETF working group for HTTP?
To: www-talk@www0.cern.ch
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 94 11:39:58 BST
Mailer: Elm [revision: 70.85]
content-length: 2285

I believe that the time has now come to develop HTTP as an IETF backed
protocol with the standard defined as a sequence of RFCs. The first step
is to draw up a charter for this activity. We can then approach the IETF
to set up an HTTP working group. Are there any volunteers to help with
writing a draft charter?

We need to get to grips with:

    a)  improved performance

        Essential if we want to continue with open standards
        for the Web in the face of intense commercial activity.

            -   MGET and multipart messages
            -   keep-alive and segmented transfers
            -   encouraging deployment of transaction TCP
            -   ways to avoid long lists of Accept headers
                and to better specify client capabilities
            -   consideration of an ASN.1 based format

    b)  security and electronic payments

        Here too, intense commercial activity threatens a mess
        of rival proprietary standards. We can aim to provide
        an open framework for incorporating different techniques,
        and to perhaps resolve export and patent licensing issues
        for unrestricted use of appropriate cryptographic modules.

            -   authentication, non-repudiation and encryption
            -   certificates and key exchange
            -   bringing together S-HTTP and Shen etc.
            -   mechanisms for electronic payments and receipts
            -   standard APIs for cryptographic library modules
            -   Commodity licenses for public domain
                cryptographic library modules

    c)  support for distributed updates

            -   transaction based mechanisms for remote
                updates, e.g. 2 phase distributed commits

            -   improved mechanisms for timely updates
                to information held in caches

            -   mechanisms for information providers
                to log access to cached documents

Ooops, wrong spec, I think its in the `server tolerance' bit of the HTTP spec.
Ie servers must try to be as tolerant as possible when interpreting a
request. They should of course produce CRLF.

I don't see how it causes problems anyway since the string is CRLF so if you
get an LF you should simply imply a CR (if you are being tolerant). I don't
see that any ambiguity arises which was the main point put.


It would be nice if the servers had an equivalent of the `bad html' message 
for http. So that when connecting to a sloppy server there would be a not to
say so.

I hope nobody interpreted what I said as implying that people should not send
a CRLF, the point is really that peoples servers should not go falling over
they only get an LF.

Right, that's precisely the right principle -- be conservative in what
you send & liberal in what you accept.  -- NB

;-)  I think you are mixing paradigms here...

PostScript can use the (atend) marker because it has an implicit separator
%%Trailer
which marks where "end" is.  The effect is similar to the MIME boundary
separator, though for a different purpose.

> Yes I know this raises other problems, it was just a suggestion.

Yes, because what it needs to know is where the end is BEFORE it gets there
(i.e. the Content-Length is used to determine where the message content ends).
Knowing how long the message is AFTER it's been processed is not very useful.

I agree that this should be done, though I would prefer not to wait until
December to start work on a definitive HTTP/1.0 spec.  I volunteer to help
write the charter.

> We need to get to grips with:

[excellent list of future issues deleted]

Let me just add that it is important that we also (first or in parallel)
document HTTP/1.0 as it exists in current practice.

  I doubt very seriously that book sales would be impacted by such an
  occurence because virtually nobody really wants to read a Steven King
  novel (or any other work of substantial length) online.  They want it
  online so it can be indexed and searched and referenced.  IMHO this would
  serve to increase printed sales of the material not to mention *vastly*
  increasing the value of information and our society (yes, I really believe
  that).
  
  Even if a text was available online I believe that most people would go
  down to the bookstore and buy a copy to read if they wanted to read it.
  *Assuming* they didn't have to buy it twice (once online and once hardcopy)!
  
Given some improvements in display technology, and assuming that the on line 
copy is _free_, I'm not sure this is true.  The price of a new book that I'm 
only going to read once is worth some amount of inconvenience.

I think some of us may have been missing (at least I think I have) that Rob 
Raisch is in fact concerned about free redistribution, rather than simply low 
cost (eg copy center) redistribution.  The copy center is relatively easy to 
track down, since they're charging money, but somebody who just throws a text 
on a public bulletin board someplace is, at least potentially, completely 
anonymous.

        Iff you can somehow switch back to "header interpretation" mode.
You've got to use some kind of boundary or delimiter.   Otherwise the
"Content-Length: 12345678"  will be seen as just more of the data.   :-(

        I addressed this problem when creating something I call
Sender Initiated File Transfer.   I didn't want to use a second stream,
but couldn't always know ahead of time how big the file would be,
so I sent things in  "segments"  (bursts),  x number of bytes at a time.
But that's not HTTP.   :-(

Personally, I find reading anything greater than about 20 sequential
pages of online documents, in *any* browser, to be rather tiresome, to
say the least. I wish there was a feature in every WWW browser which
would allow one to pull down the entire hypertyext document, format
it, and send it to the printer! Of course, this is both technically
somewhat hard to do (loops in hyperlinks, data relevance issues), and
entirely against the spirit of the WWW. I think few people will read
large books sequentially online because the medium doesn't suit it
very well.

Right. And while things like novels will noy find a large audience,
reference manuals, dictionaries, and such, will find a large potential
audience.

How about authorization outside the context of electronic payments?
I'm particularly interested in Web-centric security and privacy
models. Of course, most of the security work on the Web to date has
been in the areas you lay out; how mature does an aspect need to be
for an IETF working group? We're currently using DCE's support for
authorization to prototype Web authorization. I'm not sure how that
would fall into the framework you suggest.

Yes. See

	http://www.bsdi.com/setext/

After thinking about it some more, I think something based on GNU info
might be more useful. (There are no SeText authoring tools, though
emacs indented-text mode works pretty well).

It's tricky... folks that maintain large plaintext documents are usually
interested in having them look nice when printed on an 80x60 page. emacs
and/or nroff are the only tools I know for doing that sort of thing.

It's probably easiest at this point to maintain the FAQ in HTML and
convert it to plain text.

That's another issue. FAQ maintainers, as well as many FAQ readers,
may not have the software/expertise/interest to do that. Plain text
seems like the obvious least common denominator for FAQs, at least to
me :-). I think a plain text standard would be an easier pill to
swallow in general.

Of course it would be nice if there were good tools to go the other
way, as you suggest, but I haven't found any really adequate ones so
far.

BTW, sorry about the lack of Subject line.

This is really a question for all those cache and mirroring authors:
If your robot sends an If-Modified-Since header in a request, will that
header always appear in the first batch of headers? I'd assume the answer
would be yes, as it's only the Bogus accept lines that push queries into
the two segments.

OK, I'll buy that.

So an MGET response returning an HTML node, one small 
inline image, and one large automatically-generated
GIF could look something like this:

| <example>
| Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="outermost"
| Base-URL: http://www.somewhere.com/
| 
| --outermost
| Content-Description: main document
| Content-Type: text/html

| 
| [ HTML document here; uses binary transfer encoding with explicit
|   length in case the document contains \n--outermost\n boundary
|   string.  'quoted-printable' would also work, or just '8bit'
|   if server was willing to check for the boundary string before sending. ]
| 
| --outermost
| Content-Description: inline image
| Content-transfer-encoding: binary (illegal in RFC1522, OK in WWW)
| Content-length: 7001
| Content-Type: image/gif
| Relative-URL: /foo/bar/blueball.gif
| 
| [exactly 7001 bytes of binary data immediately following the CRLF.]
| --outermost
| Content-Description: generated image
| Content-Type: multipart/mixed (or parallel?); boundary="segment-delim"
| Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit (though subparts use 'binary')
| Comment: this body part is an encapsulated message,
|    split up into message/multipart and repackaged as multipart/mixed 
|    on the fly as the image is generated.
| 
| --segment-delim
| Content-Type: message/partial; id=www.somewhere.com:012345; part=1
| Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
| Comment: first part of the message/partial message is the header
| 
| Content-Type: image/gif
| Relative-URL: /cgi-bin/buildpicture.pl/foo/bar
| 
| --segment-delim
| Content-Type: message/partial; id=www.somewhere.com:012345; part=2
| Content-transfer-encoding: binary
| Content-Length: 65536
| Comment: first part of actual data
| 
| [exactly 65536 bytes of binary data]
| --segment-delim
| Content-Type: message/partial; id=www.somewhere.com:012345; part=3
| Content-transfer-encoding: binary
| Content-Length: 65536
| 
| [exactly 65536 bytes of binary data]
| --segment-delim
| Content-Type: message/partial; id=www.somewhere.com:012345; part=4; total=4
| Content-transfer-encoding: binary
| Content-Length: 101
|

| --segment-delim--
| 
| End of inner multipart/mixed body part
| 
| --outermost--
| 
| End of MGET response
| 
| </example>

Something similar but with one less layer of encapsulation
would be used for multi-request HTTP.

This isn't really a self-delimiting encoding though, since
the content length is in the header; it just uses currently
defined MIME mechanisms to get around the problems with
that approach.  (OK, minor nitpick, I know.)

There is a FAQ layout template ("standard" is too strong) which there
are HTML converters for.

Well, the WWW FAQ is generated this way:
http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html

but on Usenet the awareness of HTML and the web is not as high as
we might like to think...  FAQ writers usually have enough just
trying to deal with the guidelines for news.answers postings...

I looked where you indicated, above, and couldn't find anything that
looks like a standard FAQ template. Am I blind or is it no longer
there?

I tried various permutations of this for the MBONE FAQ. My current
favorite:

- write in LaTeX; generates best hardcopy output, provides table of
  contents, citations, and the like. Expresses content at a higher
  level than HTML. Write in "basic" LaTeX (section, simple emphasis
  changes, trivial tables, plus verbatim/itemize/description/enumerate).
  Use html.sty from latex2html for links.

- if desired, convert to PostScript using dvips

- convert to HTML using latex2html.

- convert to nroff/ms using l2x (a simple LaTeX-to-anything translator
  that I wrote, based on Tcl) and then easily to ASCII, either
  flush-right or typewriter-style

This approach handles (very simple) tables reasonably well. It gives
flexibility in handling things like htmladdnormallink{} in the ASCII
versions.

Dvi-to-ASCII (dvi2tty) seems to always require hand-editing to eliminate
strange spacing, missing spaces and other oddities, but it may do the
trick.

I have found none of the ASCII modes (lynx or others) of HTML tools
satisfactory. First, the emphasis can be rather loud (lots of stars,
underlines, etc.). Mosaic output depends on the screen width and is
hard to automate. Link handling is unsatisfactory (link names are dropped
altogether or put at end or some such). For FAQ that usually contain
lots of pointers to FTP sites and such, link handling is crucial.

Hi all -

Does anyone know of a telnetable WWW browser which supports forms?  I just want  
to be able to telnet into a curses-client to test a few docs on a server.  I  
also need to do some verification of a few scripts.

Any thoughts welcome,

C.

Aha! So it SHOULD be a CR LF to work (harking back to the CR LF discussion and 
sorry I don't have the message id handy). If the server just sends LF, and the 
client expects 2 bytes (CR LF) the first byte of the GIF might be skipped - or 
the client would have to check its value. But the ASCII code for LF might be a 
valid first byte for some image types - not GIF, I know.

At any rate, the CR LF problem needs to be brought to closure if we are going to 
have binary encoding. You have to know exactly where to start counting.

Yes, CR LF should be used to terminate all the header lines, especially
that tricky blank line at the end.  But those servers and CGI scripts
that use only LF as a terminator don't appear broken because every
client assumes LF is the terminator and CR is invisible.

So there's already an algorithm for detecting when the header ends.
Perhaps all we need to do is leave that as a hint to implementors
in the spec?

Subject: Webmaster's Starter Kit prerelease 2
Cc: weber@eit.COM, eit-misc@eit.COM
content-length: 1421

I just installed prerelease 2 of our Webmaster's Starter Kit (WSK).
This is the over-the-web way of configuring, installing, starting,
and extending (with maintenance tools) a Web server.

It includes easy-to-use tools for logfile reporting, link verification,
homepage building, hypermailing, and virtual document programming.

It now supports AIX, OSF/1, Sunos, Solaris, HP/UX, and IRIX.  A port to
BSDI is installed but not officially released due to a couple of bugs
that surfaced.  A better BSDI and AUX ports are underway.  Linux and NT
ports are under consideration.

Significant changes since prerelease 1:

o Now works through a proxy server!  There's a link on the Server
  Extensions page to define your proxy.

o ported to HP/UX, mostly to BSDI/386

o includes imagemap program (and hooks for a nice interactive tool, under
  development)

o fixed bug where server wasn't returning Content-type with error msgs

o mail-archive link on home page now optional

o removed graphic frills from tool interfaces

o relaxed input blank sizes on several forms to handle large filenames

o put link to home page on Server Tools page

Wow! Software install/config over the web! Fantastic!

And it works! (I just tried it out... smooth and easy.)

Some quick thoughts:

* after I downloaded the shar distribution, I have to invoke
	sh bootkit.shar
  For all I know, this will do a /bin/rf -rf ~ or something nasty
  like that. Granted, it's shell source code and I can read it, but...

  In general, it's not good to teach folks to download and run random
  programs from the net.

  My suggestion is that you allow (encourage) users to check the
  authenticity of the distribution by including (in the instructions
  on the web) all sorts of info including, but not limited to:

	- bytecount
	- gnu checksum
	- svr4 checksum
	- bsd checksum
	- md5 checksum
	- PGP signature

  For legal reasons, you should probably say something like "by
  downloading this distribution, you release EIT from all liability...
  but here's how to contact us for support if you have trouble..."


This is a FANTASTIC demonstration of "home shopping" on the net. We've
all known for a while that it was possible to do this sort of thing --
it's just a matter of testing, support, documentation, and all those
nasty real life things.

I hope this is a success and that lots of other software distributors
follow suit. Getting software from the net could really be revolutionized
this way. If you think about it:

	* every PC, Mac, and unix box ships with TCP/IP, SLIP, PPP,
	  and a forms-capable WWW client. (It'll happen soon. I'd say
	  within a year, 90% of new boxes will be WWW capable. Most
	  businesses will have a net feed of some sort. Home TCP/IP feeds
	  may take a while, but they're coming...)

	* Marketing info for zillions of products is available on the
	  web. We start with archie, which tells you almost nothing
	  about almost everything, and we enrich it via USENET, HTTP,
	  and perhaps other services/protocols to include abstracts, reviews,
	  Seals Of Approval, guides, and other catalog/magazine info.
	  This is were all this URN/URC stuff of replication and
	  authentication comes into play.

	* Users pick the product they like, fill out a form to select
	  the platform/configuration. A custom distribution is built,
	  and shipped over the net. (Licence/fee negotiation will eventually
	  become part of this process. Watermarking software to
	  trace pirated copies will become a reality.)

	  The user can get online doc over the web, or choose to download
	  the documentation, or order printed copies. (A third-party
	  market for bound documentation will probably spring up...)

	* The user follows the instructions on the web for installing
	  and configuring the software.

	* The user can submit bug reports through the same WWW client
	  interface -- or browse other bug reports with resolutions.
	  (again: this facilitates a market for third-party support).


>  Linux and NT
>ports are under consideration.

I volunteer to beta test the Linux port. Or consult, or whatever it
takes to get a linux port done.

I'd love to see linux software distribution completely migrated to
this model. I think it would be great for all the software in the
linux archives to be available this way. The free software community
is the place to research these issues and markets and see how they
work.

Then folks will eventually be willing to pay for documentation,
support, and maintenance for some products. They might be willing
to pay for search services, reviews, consulting, and a whole spectrum
of products.

I hope you don't mind that I copied www-talk.

   I agree that this should be done, though I would prefer not to wait until
   December to start work on a definitive HTTP/1.0 spec.  I volunteer to help
   write the charter.

   Let me just add that it is important that we also (first or in parallel)
   document HTTP/1.0 as it exists in current practice.

I agree also. I beleive this is the only path we can take as a loosely
coupled colaborative group to keep the ball rolling for everyone not
just the first few to get to market!

I will donate whatever time I can to help out.

One cool feature you could add would be that every time a image is transfered,
it will come up in a xv (or other image viewer) window that's already running.
This function may go into the browser part but I'm suspecting something
might also need to be changed ion the servers (?)...

It's seems pretty waistful of time to have to bring up a new xv process every
time you want to view an image... after the first image is already displayed
in a xv process...

Or prehaps you could have a switch that a viewer could turn on/off which would
determine if one xv process would be used for all image displays or not.

It sounds like the MIT/CERN consortium (with Tim Berners-Lee) has the same 
goal, of enhancing HTTP in a controlled manner, and as an open standard free 
from proprietary commercial interests.  What would be the relationship between 
the proposed IETF working group for HTTP (in the above message), and the 
MIT/CERN efforts?  We would want to avoid the Unix syndrome of multiple 
standards.  Maybe the two groups could work together to propose and ratify the 
same extensions to the HTTP standard, with the IETF body giving the unified 
standard enhanced credibility?

One important thing to remember is that the IETF will not advance any document
as a proposed standard unless it has complete change control over the document.

I believe that there has been some discussion about publishing an informational
RFC documenting the currently implemented version of HTTP, but I don't know
about future plans - the ietf-draft was allowed to lapse, which is not usually
a good sign. Erik? 

Would anyone be interested in a bof on the next generation of HTTP at the
Chicago Web con? I'm planning to do an ad-hoc tutorial on ASN.1, and the packed
encoding rules (there are plenty of BOF rooms available), and that should 
segue nicely into a futures bof.

Yes... it is interesting.

	+ it seems well-thought out. It includes digital signatures
	  for packages

	- if you're not part of the aforementioned "Integrated Computing
	  Environment" you're somewhat out of luck. The system seems
	  to depend on all machines using the same absolute paths for
	  locating software packages.

	- You have to have root access to install a package.

I posted a note on one of the linux newsgroups about this, but
I guess I'll say it here:

I'd like to be able to install a package:

	* on a per-user basis, in $HOME somewhere

	* on a per-group basis, in some group-writable directory

	* on a per-host basis, in /usr/local or some such
		(root priv. required)

	* on a per-site basis, in some nfs-exported directory
	  or some such

Further, I'd like to install a package on a per-user basis, test
it out, and then upgrade it to a per-group/host/site installation
without much hassle.

It's really a shame that a software distribution can't be just
unpacked anywhere in the filesystem and work properly. A unix
executable can't reliably find the directory where it lives
to find config files.

Mac applications can do it, but then there's the question of
per-session, per-invocation, per-user configuration and such.

Here's a real nightmare example: on a DOS box, a hard disk
was partitioned into C and D drives. lots of software lived
on each partition. Lots of windows program icons had hard-coded
D:\... paths. A second hard disk was installed. DOS, in its
infinite wisdom, henceforth refers to two partitions on the new
disk as D: and F:. The original disk is now C: and E:. The
software has magically migrated from D: to E:, so the
windows program icon files are out of sync, and they have to
be fixed manually -- the only reliable way to do it is to
reinstall all the apps.

What a mess!

Does anybody know how software installation works in the new
CDE/COSE systems?

Thanks.  I thought this was important since I'm always paranoid about
security. I wanted to be sure I could have Mosaic (my choice of browsers)
always configured for Cicero and not accidentally compromise my system...

Actually...

If you're not part of the ICE, you may still be ok.  While it's true that
some packages (like emacs) care about where their binaries go, not all do.
It's easy to configure Cicero to use a different path if you want to have
packages go in a different directory.  There's no good way to do it on an
individual package basis with Mosaic though.

Other than a simple check in the scripts, there's really nothing to
prevent you from running Cicero under another uid.  If you just want a
personal copy of a package (and it doesn't mind not being in
/usr/local) you can certainly use Cicero to install it.  I should probably
add an option to supress the uid check...

These are pretty good ideas.  I will give some thought as to how Cicero
could be modified to add more support for different installation options.
I think we'll still be hosed if a package has compiled pathnames, though...

	David

PS.  Unless this discussion takes a 90 degree turn back into WWWland, 
Please don't followup to the list.  I gladly take questions (though maybe
the answer is "Cicero's not available yet" 8-)

Subject: HTML list archive moving!
content-length: 1518

As promised, I'm moving my HTML archives of this list (and others related
to the Web, publishing and libraries) to a new, faster site at my new
employer, Verity Inc.  I'll keep the archive up at
<URL:http://asearch.mccmedia.com/> for another week or two, but please
start using the one at Verity, which can be reached from our home page,
<URL://www.verity.com/>.

You'll find things somewhat rearranged there and a couple of features are
temporarily missing.  There are no aliases to the top menus of the lists,
and there's no full-text search yet.  Okay, okay, I know that second one is
ironic, considering that Verity has a great full-text search engine (if I
say so myself), but don't worry, it won't be far behind... and it'll be
great!  We have some very cool things coming, including... oh, well, stay
tuned.

The Verity site is under constant improvement, so please bear with us if
it's off-line occasionally.  We'll do our best to minimize the down-time.

The one improvement that you should notice immediately is SPEED.  I'm
switching from a Macintosh Quadra 605 over a 28.8 phone line to a very fast
Sun workstation with a T-1 that's only two hops off a very fast backbone...
We're still generating the files with a Mac, though.  HyperCard remains my
favorite prototyping environment.

Feedback is encouraged.  Please feel free to e-mail me or our Webmaster
[webmaster@verity.com] with your comments.

Version 0.40 of libwww-perl is now available.

libwww-perl is a library of Perl4 packages which provides a simple
and consistent programming interface to the World-Wide Web.  This
library is being developed as a collaborative effort to assist the
further development of useful WWW clients and tools.

The distribution site and much more information about the libraries
can be found at 

       <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/>

and also at

       <ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/libwww-perl/>


I am looking for more contributions to support the many protocols.

A mailing list has been established for technical discussion about
libwww-perl, including problem reports, interim fixes, suggestions
for features, and contributions. The mailing list address is 

       libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu

and administrivia (including subscribe requests) should be sent to 

       libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu

A Hypermail Archive of the mailing list is also available at

       <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/archive/>


Changes from version 0.30:

   Revamped the "get" program: Added code to show original headers if they
   were received; Added tout= to interactively change the timeout value;
   Added ims= to interactively give If-Modified-Since; Added handling of
   POST content suggested by Mel Melchner; Added command-line options,
   debug and quiet modes such that the program is now ideal for testing
   server/proxy responses to requests;  Added "get -h" usage information.
   Added $headers initialization to other test clients as well.

   Changed the name of Changes.txt to LWP_Changes.pl and moved
   the $www'Library version name so that it can be set there.
   Added a new Makefile to ease the installation process.
   Added sys_socket_ph.c to help find problems in SVR4 system installs.
   Added hostname.pl so that people can more easily/portably get host names.
   Fixed more usage of undefined proxy environment vars (from Martijn Koster).

   Fixed a number of problems with the handling of years in wwwdates.pl,
   most of which were due to limitations in timelocal.pl, which goes into
   an infinite loop if (year >= 2038).  Now handles 2 and 4-digit years
   regardless of date format.

   In wwwhttp.pl, removed unnecessary bind() and host stuff (Jack Shirazi);
   Added a bunch of alarm() calls to lessen timeout problems; Now replaces
   empty paths with "/" (Marc VanHeyningen); Changed name of &timeout
   routine to &timed_out to avoid confusion with $timeout parameter.

   In wwwurl.pl, the parsing sets were renamed to match the IETF draft
   on Relative URLs and the method used to test them was changed to use
   bitmap masks.  Modified parsing algorithm to use the new sets.
   Parser now handles URLs like http://host:/ and uses the leftmost "?"
   as the start of query info.  Added caching of base URL components so
   that they don't get re-parsed for every URL in a document.  Now allows
   lowercase hex digits in unescape().

   Added a source code "contrib" directory at
   <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/contrib/> for use as
   a half-way house for wayward programs.


Have fun,

Hello,

This will not be the right place (off-topic) for this kind 
of postings. I appologize... I am sorry if it offends you.

But it's a mans life that's at stake here!
I hope I can count on all you Cyberians, because...

=> Tonight at 24h Central European Time the
execution of the dutch Johannes van Damme will
take place if the government of Singapore will
not change its mind...


Amnesty International has started a last Blitz-action
to prevent the DEATH-PENALTY being executed, since
the diplomatic approach started april '93 has not been
succesful.

I support Amnesty's action, and I like everybody here in
Cyberspace to join the Appeal.



This is the Amnesty International Teletext action:

=========================================================


 FLASH-ACTION FOR JOHANNES VAN DAMME   

         Amnesty International has started a
         'flash-action' at wednesday for a
         revision of the DEATH-PENALTY of
         the 59 years old Johannes van Damme 
         from the Netherlands.

         Van Damme was arrested on september 
         27th 1991 in possession of 4 kilogram
         heroine. On april 26th 1993 he received
         the death-penalty for this.

         Amnesty International on principle is
         against the death-penalty.
         Taken in consideration that Van Damme
         likely has been set up and trapped,
         Amnesty calls on anybody to protest
         against the verdict, trough FAX or
         TELEGRAM.
         
 The text of the appeal goes as follows:
                                                
         I, (name) express deep concern that    
         Johannes Van Damme is scheduled to be  
         executed on 23 September 1994.         
         I urge President Ong Teng Cheong to    
         reconsider his decision and to grant   
         Johannes Van Damme clemency by         
         commuting his death sentence.I support 
         Amnesty International's unconditional  
         opposition to the death penalty,and    
         urge that all existing and pending     
         death sentences be commuted.

This has probably happened before, but I noticed an

	This gets into sysadmin tastes and tactics and is  (obviously) 
quite O/S dependent.   You're probably talking about UNIX.   (well ... 
WSK is targetted to UNIX)   ;-) 
 
	Yes,  all four are essential features.   The way we have done it 
at Rice handles 3 and 4 nicely  (the same way).   I think there's enough 
momentum in the net  (shareware and freebe applications)  that all four 
are doable without much effort.

	Amen!   If the structure of the app is the typical  bin, 
lib,  and (maybe) etc  directories under the application root, 
you're in good shape.   We've been layering a  "platform"  level 
between the app-root and the real stuff: 
 
		.../(application)/(platform)/bin 
		.../(application)/(platform)/lib 
		and so on 
 
	But this is UNIX,  not the web. 
 
	Back to the web:  I've used this thing  'webcat'  with 
some success to distribute  "archives"  of pre-built applications. 
Say you've got X11R5 pl25.   You might have it all compiled and 
ready to go in the file  X11R5-pl25.tar.   I think it's kinda neat 
to be able to 
 
		mkdir app-root # whereever it might be 
		chdir app-root 
		webcat URL | tar xf - 
 
	and just fill-out the tree right off the wire.

	Yeah.   That's frustrating.   That capability is my goal. 
With UNIX,  the location is often compiled-in.   Bad.   But what else 
can you do?   Stick everything in  /etc?   X has the app-defaults 
directory and the resources database.   Then there are environment 
variables,  but those are a pain to initialize consistently. 
 
	But we're getting back into UNIX again.   Sorry guys.

	I speculate that the server "web.nexor.co.uk" is running GN.
I like GN, and have installed several servers running it, but it does
have one or two tiny flaws... :-)

	GN can serve menus and documents to both HTTP and Gopher
clients from a single set of files.  Unfortunately, the current
implementation wants to advertise each menu link with a single port
number (you get to choose which) regardless of the protocol or port
number used to retrieve the menu containing the link.

	I've proposed on the GN Maintainers mailing list a relatively
simple change that will correct this condition, but I haven't received
a wild response; perhaps no one cares very much about the port number
used, so long as it works?

Well, we can talk about UNIX first (because it is both complex and powerful)
and then try to generalize the solution to other OSes.  Bottom line is
that you must start somewhere and very few people know the gory details
of very many OSes.

So with that in mind, here is one possible solution with UNIX:

1)  The file /etc/applications could contain a mapping from
    "application/version" to the root directory path and could
    also store other data items.
2)  Users personal file is ~/.applications
3)  Override with $APPLICATIONS environment variable
4)  Define a C library interface to manipulate it:
	#include <appdata.h>
	APPDATA *ad = getappdata("xtoss/1.2");
	chdir(ad->rootpath);

This basically follows the termcap/app-default solution (each level should
be able to specify customizations and then punt to the upper level).  The
X app-defaults files have some nice features (like globbing) but I don't
know that all of them would be useful in this environment.

Subject: SURVEY: size distribution of HTTP transfers
content-length: 2579

	I'll send this message to this list, because I'm a bit hurry
to get some input and results. (Originally posted to
comp.infosystems.www.provides, the script is not included here but a
URL is given instead.)

	I'm making a little survey of transfer sizes of HTTP. For
that, I need Your help. If you are running (or otherway have access to
logs of) http-server, please run program, which is available <A
HREF="http://www.hut.fi/~puhuri/WWW-bytes.gz">here, (gzipped, 1318
bytes)</A> and mail resulted file to me. <Markus.Peuhkuri@hut.fi>

	A program is a perl script (works at least with 4.0). Gunzip
it. It results a 'WWW-bytes'-named file, what you can run with
./WWW-bytes (or by "perl WWW-bytes").

	It reads logfile(s), which are given as command line arguments
or if none given, reads from stdin. It exepts files to be in "COMMON"
format. (It does not come up with anything useful if this is not a
case.) It outputs its result to stdout, so redirection is needeed.

So, run it like
./WWW-bytes /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/access_log > bytes.out
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ replace with your log
						 file location

or, if you have files archieved like 'access_log.19940901.gz':
zcat /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd/logs/access_log.*.gz | ./WWW-bytes > bytes.out

or, if you want to include both current and archieved:
zcat /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd/logs/access_log.*.gz | ./WWW-bytes > bytes.out
./WWW-bytes /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/access_log >> bytes.out

(it does not matter, if they are in separate tables)

	Then mail resulting file to me. If you like, you can give name
of your host and some description of host, like if you have some
special service, that causes lots of traffic.

	I can't gurantee, that the program does not break anything,
but I have had no intention to do such and I've tried to make it clear
(it even has some comments...). Maybe it could also be faster, but at
least it works... It only reads from stdin and writes to stdout and
stderr, no other files or programs is used.

	Neither it does not give out any sensitive information (IMHO),
but of course, you can check the output (and the source). (No other
text than what is in program itself and then numbers).

	At least I tell something of results to those, who submit
information. If I get even more results, I'll send it to here or some
other proper place.

	Thank you, for responses.

Tim is unlikely to respond so I will.

First off Dave did contact me and a number of CERN WWW developers before
launching this. While it is diffult to talk about an organisation that does
not exist (yet) Dave is one of the few people besides Tim who can make 
statements likely to be identifiable with future W30 policy with a significant
probability of a high correlation factor between prediction and practice.
I hope that is vague enough for everyone to understand.

On the subject of W3O it is not Tim's or anyone else involved in W3O to go 
round screwing other peoples standards, pinching their lunches, atarting
turf wars etc. W3O is an organisation to do something of an X11 with a 
distinct IETF flavour. Many of the people involved in W3O will be IETF
stalwarts. Many will be contributors to www-talk. W3O is needed because
unlike other IETF protocols we have the significant disadvantage of a 
very highly compressed time frame. We have commercial interests to satisfy,
hardware vendors wanting to get generic standards and willing to chip in
with personel etc and governments wanting to spend money on IT.

There are already severe other constraints on us. The HTML spec is quite
rightly having to go through lots of hoops to meet the needs of the ICAD
(disabled & special needs) people. Currently the maths end of HTML is
seeing quite a lot of improvement in other areas as a result. Legitimate
constraints are often useful. It is the illegitimate ones that pop up because
of half cocked notions of optimisation that are often the most dangerous 
ones.

At some point I would see the security side of things splitting into a separate
working group anyway. I don't think we should suggest a separate group quite
yet though, it really is a question of overlap between PEM and HTTP. Perhaps
a joint subcommittee might be a usefull adjunct to try to sort out the
interface.


On the Chicago front I was hoping for a Pizza of a feather session one evening
on the subject of http. If a BOF is booked please don't clash with the
security or HTML+ sessions since certain flag carriers have to attend both
who might just have a few things to say on http as well :-)

Last time HTTP was discussed in the specialised servers and gateways 
workshop because there was so much overlap.

We've found that by retrieving the following URL:

last night, we got:

HTTP/1.0 304 Itsa gone

which means not-modified. We speculate that it's supposed to mean 302
or 301, which is redirect. This can play havoc on browsers and proxies
who use 304 to indicate using a local copy and makes the document
unloadable.

That was last night. Today, we get:

Hmmm. How useful.

Simon, is this something we can expect a fix for soon?

I strongly support your suggestion.  I will be delighted to assist in the
charter-writing.

I also concur with the followup suggestion that we not wait until December.
Working group chartering and activity has NO requirement for being
synchronized with IETF meetings.  It can all happen electronically.  The
meetings are a matter of convenience and efficiency, only.

As to the choice between documenting what is, versus pursuing enhancements,
I suggest that we start by documenting what is, since the protocol is well
established and has a large installed base.  The formal nicity of deciding
whether to standardize it directly and THEN pursue enhancements, versus
jumping directly to standardizing enhancements, without stopping to
standardize current practise, seems to depend most on the stability of the
current use and the pressure for enhancements.

My own opinion is that the most expeditious path is to document the current
practise and publish it as one or more Informational RFCs, rather than
pursue standardization.  If we standardize the current practise, we really
can't make any standards-track changes for about a year.  The pressure for
enhancements is pretty strong, as I read it.

By the way, I think your list of work to do looks pretty good.

The proposal below is for support of file upload in the World Wide Web.  A few initiatives and custom examples have appeared on various WWW lists, but they have led to nothing.  With this proposal, we hope to give this feature enough momentum to make some form of it a reality among the widely available WWW servers and browsers.  Please keep the discussion in www-talk (to avoid 3 discussion threads).  If you would like to see file upload become part of the WWW, please voice your support for that capability, even if you disagree with the specifics of this proposal.

Thank you.

FILE TRANSMISSION FROM WORLD WIDE WEB BROWSERS TO SERVERS
---------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction 
--------------- 
Currently, a World Wide Web server can get information from users with
HTML forms.  These forms have proven useful in a wide variety of
applications in which input from the user is necessary.  But this
capability is still greatly limited because HTML forms don't provide a
way for the user to submit files to the server.  Service providers who
need to get files from the user have had to implement custom browsers.
(Examples of these custom browsers have appeared on the www-talk
mailing list.)  To avoid the necessity for custom browsers and to make
WWW servers complete in their ability to get information from the
user, the WWW needs to provide a way for users to send files to
servers.  Since user information is sent back to the server using HTML
forms, it is most logical to extend HTML forms to support file
submission.


II. HTML forms with file submission
----------------------------------- 
The HTML specification, version 2.0, dated July 1994 (by T.
Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, and K. Muldrow, locate at
http://www.hal.com/products/sw/olias/Build-html/html-spec.ps), defines
8 possible values for the attribute TYPE of an INPUT element: text,
password, checkbox, radio, submit, reset, image, and hidden.  The
proposed change is to add a TYPE "file".  The author of an HTML form
who wants to request one or more files from a user would simply write
(for example):


    File to process: <INPUT NAME="userfile1" TYPE="file">


The change to the HTML DTD is trivial: just one item added to the
entity "InputType", as follows.


... (other elements) ...

<!ENTITY % InputType "(TEXT | PASSWORD | CHECKBOX |
                       RADIO | SUBMIT | RESET |
                       IMAGE | HIDDEN | FILE )">
<!ELEMENT INPUT - 0 EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST INPUT
	TYPE %InputType TEXT
	NAME CDATA #IMPLIED  -- required for all but submit and reset
	VALUE CDATA #IMPLIED
        SRC %URI #IMPLIED  -- for image inputs --
        CHECKED (CHECKED) #IMPLIED
        SIZE CDATA #IMPLIED  --like NUMBERS,
                                but delimited with comma, not space
        MAXLENGTH NUMBER #IMPLIED
        ALIGN (top|middle|bottom) #IMPLIED
        >

... (other elements) ...


III. Proposed implementation
----------------------------
The proposed implementation in WWW browsers is for a browser to show a
text box with a "Browse" button next to it whenever it encounters an
INPUT tag of TYPE "file".  The initial size of the text box can be
controlled by the SIZE attribute (SIZE=width,height).  Pressing the
"Browse" button pops up a file selection window.  The file or
directory currently selected in the file selection window gets added
to a new line of the text box anytime the user presses an "Add to
list" button on the file selection window.  For convenience, the file
selection window remains on the screen until the user presses a
"Close" button.  The user can manually add and remove files and
directories from the text box.

A WWW server may not be prepared to receive more than a certain number
of bytes, or it may want to check the number of files that the user
wants to submit.  This proposal suggests sending only the file paths
and file sizes, and possibly some other information, to the server
when the user presses the SUBMIT button.  This information can be url
encoded and sent to the server along with the rest of the form data.
(The browser should use one or more name/value pairs for each file to
avoid complications when multiple files are submitted.  The initial
name/value pair corresponding to an INPUT TYPE="file" tag can contain
the number of file names being sent so that the server knows how many
name/value pairs to examine).  For a directory, the browser sends the
path to the directory and the sum of the component sizes.

The CGI script receiving the form data at the server can check how
many files it will receive, it can check that it has enough storage
space for the files, and it can prepare a location for the storage of
the files.  If the server decides not to accept the files, then the
CGI script responds with a text/html response containing an
appropriate message.  If the server is ready to accept the files, it
responds with data of a new MIME type (for example:
application/x-sendfiles) that contains the paths to the files to send,
the full URL of the server, and other information relevant to the file
transfer (for example, file sizes or other data that can be used to
check if the files changed since the form was submitted).  On
receiving data of this new MIME type, the browser pops open a window
displaying the file names of the files which will be sent to the
server.  The user checks this list and confirms or cancels the file
transfer.  Upon confirmation by the user, the browser compresses,
encodes, encrypts (in a secure version), and transmits the files to
the server using HTTP's POST.  At the server, the receiving CGI script
decrypts, decodes, expands, and stores the files.

One advantage of this proposal is that, with a little effort from the
server, this implementation makes the new "file" TYPE backward
compatible.  A browser which does not support this new "file" type
will just display a text entry field.  The user can cut and paste
files from the file manager on his machine, or can type file paths,
into the text field.  On submission of the form, the server analyzes
the name/value pairs and recognizes that it got a list of file names
in one text field instead of a set of name/value pairs with more
complete information about the files.  The server can now send a
text/html response with an appropriate message, like "please ftp your
files to ... ", or "please install browser ... with file submission
support, version x.x, available at <ftp link to browser>".
Furthermore, the server can provide its own external viewer
application to send files from the client's machine to the server.
Before asking the user for files, this server asks the user if he's
using a browser which supports the "file" TYPE.  If he's not, then the
server provides the user with a link to a trusted "sendfiles"
application and instructs the user to retrieve it, install it on his
machine, and configure his browser to use it as an external viewer.
For the user, this would be as easy as installing any other external
viewer of images, sound files, or whatever.  Once this application is
installed, the browser responds to data of the new MIME type by
launching this external "sendfiles" application, which asks the user
to confirm transmission of the displayed files and then sends the
files to the server (after encoding, compression, etc.)

Another advantage of the proposed approach is that a server, if it
chooses, can delay the request for the files until a later form is
submitted.  The server can store file information submitted with
several forms and respond with new forms until the user submits a
specific form.  Then, the server responds with the new MIME type to
initiate the actual file transfer.


IV. Conclusion
--------------
The suggested implementation gives the client a lot of flexibility in
the number and types of files it can send to the server, it gives the
server control of the decision to accept the files, and it gives
servers a chance to interact with browsers which do not support INPUT
TYPE "file".

The change to the HTML DTD is very simple, but very powerful.  It
enables a much greater variety of services to be implemented via the
World Wide Web than is currently possible due to the lack of a file
submission facility.  This would be an extremely valuable addition to
the capabilities of the World Wide Web.

Many thanks for the reply on this subject.  Summarizing, is it fair to say 
that W30 will be able to work more quickly than an IETF working group 
for HTTP, but that the IETF working group will probably arrive at a 
standard that is (at some level) compatible with the W30 efforts?

Thanks again.

Subject: File Transfer Proxy

I'm part of a team that is working on an application where the NCSA
httpd would be an attractive choice as an agent transfering a file
to a host, where all of the necessary information is provided by the
browser/client in a URL (e.g., absolute path and filename, IP address
of target, etc.).  The file is on the same host as the httpd, and the
client will access the file, via a network file system, once is has been 
delivered to the target host--but the target IS NOT the client machine.  
Right now, FTP is the protocol of choice.  Probably not anon FTP. 

While I've been reading the httpd code (Boy, is it UGLY!) and everything
else I can find on WWW and related topics, there's a learning curve here
just like everywhere else.  I can't say I've completely scaled it yet. ;) 

It seems like I'm talking about adding a method, perhaps called "RCOPY" 
--but I really want to know is if what we're considered is intrinsically
in keeping with the spirit of the Web.  If the answer is "yes" then 
are we on the right track--or is there an existing method that already
provides a mechanism for doing this?  I've looked some at the CGI stuff,
and, at least at first glance, it doesn't seem robust enough. 

Clues gratefully accepted. ;)

Subject: WWW, Mosiac, and Access for People with Disabilities
content-length: 1238

Hi,

I'm an ardent reader of this listserv; this is my first reply to members. In
December, I'll be presenting at the MecklerMedia-sponsored Internet World
conference in Washington D.C.

Along with several colleagues in the field, I'll be addressing the issue of
accessibility of the WWW and Mosaic for people with disabilities, particularly
those shut out from the WWW because of the functional limitations of Mosiac
for people with disabilities.

It is true that Character Cell based browsers (LYNX) are helpful. But issues
related to file format, character display size, sound clips with out
captioning, descriptive video, and the play inaccessibility of Mosiac are
topics we'll be discussing during our panel session.

I would be interested and grateful to hear your thoughts and generate
meaningful dialog concerning these issues.

Regards,

Absolutely.  If it were just a matter of implementing a remote copy
via FTP agent, we'd just use a proxy FTP mechanism as someone already
suggested.  This application is the first phase of a document access
system which would be entirely Web browser based, from the client side.

For various reasons, we don't want the documents to be directly available
on the server -- we want to transfer them to a client-accessible filesystem
after some authentication and accounting is done.   We also want this to
be expanded into a general information server gateway: WAIS, gopher, etc.  

This is why it's so important for us to make sure that we're keeping
the general spirit of the Web intact as we do this, instead of just 
pasting a bunch of crap in that isn't conceptually integrated with it.

It *seems* to be conceptually related, but then I've only been working
with this stuff for about a month or so, and there's a substantial 
amount of material to master... ;)

Hi,

I think it is fair to say that the W3O working group will be in large part
comprised of IETF type people and that a lot of W3O people will be poping
up in IETF contexts. 

At the end of the day aomeone somewhere will draw up an organisation chart
formalising the relationships between all these various bodies with liasons
etc etc after which we can all ignor it and get back to work.

I don't think the IETF are especially keen to create a second, incompatible
standard for HTTP etc. Nor is W3O. So long as the IETF is happy that the
spec is sound and is not a trojan horse for proprietary interests or falls
foul of any other IETF naughty then I can't see them insisting that we
make derranged changes to the spec that break existing browsers. But then again
we will have to wait 'n see. If the president of the IETF were to wake up
with a horse head in his bed then I might be concerned that things might turn
nasty in future. Until then I think that we should assume that nobody involved
wants diverngent standards.

I'm not speaking for W30 by the way, only Tim can do that.

Subject: Forms support in clients
content-length: 769

Has anyone thought of allowing text substitution using forms? For
example:

<!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "html.dtd">
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Search Form</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<HR>
<H1>Search Form</H1>
The following is a simple search template. Please fill in the fields.
<P>
<FORM ACTION="http://foo/$doc?$sstr" METHOD=GET>
Enter your query below.
<INPUT TYPE="text"   ID="sstr" NAME="Search string" MAXLENGTH=80><P> 
<INPUT TYPE="text"   ID="doc"  NAME="Document Name" MAXLENGTH=80><P> 
<INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="Send Request"> 
</FORM>
</BODY>

ID is just an example. Ideally we should use NAME. Such a scheme would
add a huge amount of flexibility to forms support at little cost I
think. Looking at the code in Mosaic that handles forms, the changes
appear to be simple enough...

Just to sumarise some of the current work going on. We have been discussing
the HTML+ design specifically with respect to these issues. We hope to be
able to support speach synthesis, large type etc for the whole DTD including
Math.

Modularisation of the library should assist in the slotting in of custom
formatting routines eg for large type or special spacing (eg for dyslexia). 
This mechanism needs to be carfully designed so that other formatting
modules can be inserted, eg a specialist Chemistry formatting routine.

I suggest that we start out with a road map of version numbers. There is no
point in doing anything with HTTP/1.0. By now everyone has had a go at it!

I suggest :-

HTTP/1.0	Anything you like and can find a URL to discribe :-(

HTTP/1.1	First cleanup version, basically describe current practice,
		i.e "what Mosaic does" and the servers do.

HTTP/2.0	First target version, standard which browsers should be 
		trying to attain :-

	1) Methods, GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, kill the CHECKIN/CHECKOUT
		methods etc.
	2) Referer field mandatory.
	3) Digest authentication method (to eventually replace basic) must 
		be supported.
	4) Clients should send quality field for accepts.

HTTP/3.0	The target protocol, asynchronous support for conferencing, 
		MGET etc.


I would like to propose a distinction between the protocol specification
and the client/server specification.

Protocol specification: What the clients and servers must tolerate
Client specification: The subset of the protocol that a client may use
Server specification: The subset of the protocol that a server may use.

Thus a client claiming to meet the HTTP/2.0 spec must provide the referer
field (subject to security restrictions), but a server may not require it
to be provided.


Before being fixed each version would have a revision number so that the
February spec for HTTP/1.1 can be distinguished from the March one etc. When
the standard is fixed then the revision is dropped. Ie my above proposals
should really be HTTP/1.1R1 etc.


As far as standards tracks go. I think we will always have at least
three on the go. There will be an established one in use, static and supported.
There will be another that has been fixed and is undergoing minor revisions
during the standards process and there will be a third highly volatile
development spec.

Here we can knock out the HTTP/1.1 spec with little difficulty as an
informational RFC. HTTP/2.0 would be the one to put through standards
track and HTTP/3.0 would be the development one.

Hopefully once we have the filter for turning RFCs into code finished 
we can speed up the development process.

I don't understand what you're trying to do.  If you're trying to give 
names to the variables in a form, doesn't the NAME tag do that already?
Or are you trying to place some sort of default text in the text entry 
field (which can be done using VALUE)?

No - he wants documents that can be more like programs.  basically he
wants to display the form, have the user fill in what doc he
would like (as an example) and then have the browser do a text
substitution on the ACTION part before performing the GET.

The current requires-no-changes way is to use a script for this
which accepts two parameters and issues a redirect for them.

#!/usr/bin/perl-off-the-top-of-my-head

$Q= $ENV{'QUERY_STRING'};
@VARS= split(/&/, $Q);
foreach(@VARS) { ($KEY, $VAL)= split(/=/,$_,2); $VAR{$KEY}=$VAL; }
print "Location: $base$VAR{'doc'}?$VAR{'sstr'}\r\n\r\n";
print "Document has moved <A HREF=\"$base$VAR{'doc'}?$VAR{'sstr'}\"here</A>";
print "\n";

You might sling a URI header in there for good measure.
This would be used with the form below, using NAME instead of ID
and an ACTION pointing to the script...

Ernesto,

While it would be very useful to have the facilities you describe, we must 
be careful in any design not to sidetrack the ultimate goal, which is a 
read/write web with editing browsers  as orignally envisioned.

While this is basically correct, I would like to see the text
substitution be entirely general so that it could support basically
any URL format, including server-specific extensions. The idea could
be made to work with current servers by doing a substitution like:

  foo?text=$text

My biggest complaint is that this forces a particular URL format on
all servers, and that format does double duty as the query format.

At considerable expense I might add. I should mention that I think
this will be even more useful once more servers start supporting PUT
et al. and even more so once multiple transactions are allowed in
HTTP. For example, if I have a server that supports PUT and
versioning, a natural URL format might be: 

http://foo/document_path/version_path ( http://foo/mydoc/11/2)

but if we want to have a form asking what new version number to
assign, or to check out, we would have to use the URL format:

http://foo/mydoc?version="11.2"

which isn't quite as "natural". My personal opinion is that forms,
queries, and fragment ID's are where URL's really are quite weak now.
I'm not sure that any *defined* system will work well in *all*
situations, so it seems better to support something that will give us
flexibility to adapt URL's and forms as needed.

I think overall the idea would be a win, and I'm very surprised that
this wasn't done initially as implementation would be very little more
complicated that the current forms system. Now it's almost too late to
make changes because of the inertia...

  Along with several colleagues in the field, I'll be addressing the issue of
  accessibility of the WWW and Mosaic for people with disabilities,
  particularly
  those shut out from the WWW because of the functional limitations of Mosiac
  for people with disabilities.
  
  It is true that Character Cell based browsers (LYNX) are helpful. But issues
  related to file format, character display size, sound clips with out
  captioning, descriptive video, and the play inaccessibility of Mosiac are
  topics we'll be discussing during our panel session.
  
Could you expand on this a little.  I am visually impaired (to scale this, I 
have a driver's license but most people who know me are terrified at the 
thought of my actually driving) and I find the ability to set the X version of 
Mosaic to 24 point type play with colors to enhance contrast very helpful.  Is 
the issue that Mosaic encourages authors to do cute media things, or is there 
some other issue.  I ask because this seems to be a current cultural thing;  I 
find most of Wired magazine illegible, for instance, but I have seen people 
from Wired _complain_ that Mosaic lets people mess with their artistic fonts.

I believe file submission is mainly a browser issue -- one should be  
able to (say) drag-n-drop a file into any TEXTAREA and have the  
contents POSTed as the field's value.  The author of the page cannot  
(and perhaps should not try to) anticipate in which fields the user  
might want to place the contents of a file instead of typing by hand.

Your [nebel@xsoft.sd.xerox.com (Ernesto Nebel)] proposal does provide  
some additional features that could be of use to server maintainers.   
On the down side, in addition to requiring changes of both browsers  
and servers, it would posit some rather fundamental changes to the  
current model of HTTP as a stateless protocol.  I don't think such a  
change should be made lightly.

There's been some talk around here, as I vaguely recall, about TCL for this
sort of thing.  Any thoughts, anyone, on the idea of letting TCL swallow up
HTML, so that we have a real UI language that contains a real hypertext
language, instead of trying to built a UI language out of a hypertext
language?  (Which just ain't gonna happen, I suspect...)

Please not TCL.  It is intrinsicly inefficient and, to my eyes, quite
inelegant.

(My preference is Scheme, but I somehow suspect that this isn't
necessarily going to be popular with People who have been brought
up on shell programming and C.)

Whatever, the language, the important issues are a secure/safe
abstract machine in which it is to execute.

On viewers, I suspect execution efficency isn't particularly important
when talking about display generation or forms.  But once the door is
opened a little, some folk are going to want to do more general
computations.

If we talk about execution on the servers or in caches, then I think
we need to be concerned about efficiency.

The larger issue when one starts talking about pushing executable
candy-grams around the network is controlling those that have more
than an extremely short life span.

Tcl isn't a "real GUI" language - not to start any language wars, mind 
you, but I think the reason people mention Tcl and GUI in the same breath 
is Tk, which (though I haven't played with it yet) is a GUI class library
which runs under Tcl (Tcl:Tk::C:Motif, in other words).  Last I heard Tk 
was being ported to Perl as well (TkPerl).  Another, more complete 
solution is something like WINTERP, a LISP-ish language with integrated 
user interface capabilities.

If we want a real UI language, we want to get away from the notion of
delivery of static documents.  Not a bad idea, just not something there's an
easy answer for - and I should reference all the debates about scripting
languages and security that have happened here before.  HTML simply isn't 
about GUI's or being pretty - it's strength, in my opinion, is in its 
flexibility across a wide array of platforms and giving the user the 
ability to control a large part of the presentation.  I can't reconcile 
that quite yet with a "real GUI" language, and I don't know that it's 
possible.  The way I see it, there are three things that'll give us about 
all we need in terms of functionality:

1) HTML (with extensive presentational hints, improvements in many areas 
	- I'll probably be satisfied by the time HTML 4.0 comes around :)
2) Acrobat/HyperPostscript/some-other-document-language-that-assumes-complete
	-control-over-presentation
3) Browser plug-in modules to extend GUI functionality in a standard way, 
	and explicitly installed by the user (the "Acrobat" plug in, the
	"AOL interface" plug-in, etc.)  I don't subscribe to the notion that
	the information provider should have automatic control over that 
	element.

There may be battles between 2 and 3 if not designed well.

While this might be reasonable if you're thinking the submissions as
mainly text, it isn't reasonable to have a TEXTAREA for uploading a
postscript file, or audio, or graphics. Nor is it particularly useful
if the input is allowed to be multiple items.

In addition, the upload method for large data streams cannot usefully
be done with "x-urlencoded" or whatever.

It only requires changes to servers that want to accept data in this
way, and those changes seem to be accomplishable with CGI scripts;
it *does* require browser extensions, but as has been pointed out,
it can be handled in a way that current browsers will function, just
not optimially.

There's nothing in the proposal that requires *any* change to the HTTP
protocol, so this is a misstatement.

> I don't think such a change should be made lightly.

I agree. I'll observe, though, that the proposal wasn't made lightly;
it was posted on this and other mailing lists, and suggestions for
improvements or alternatives solicited. It's certainly a widely
requested feature, and a prerequisite for useful deployment of a wide
variety of web-based services.

Not to start a language war, but Tk has also been ported to Python.
The home URL for Python is ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/python/, read the
INDEX or index.html file; the Tk port in is tkinter.tar.gz.

Yes; an arbitrarily powerful language, designed to be powerful and
secure, is where it is at.

Not entirely false, though largely a matter of opinion.

More or less.  There are a number of desirable characteristics:

- A secure language for which secure implementations are "easy"
- A reasonably simple language that can be learned and implemented in
  a vaguely concise way
- A language which allows a variety of presentation approaches (e.g. a
  single program can use a GUI interface or a simpler interface,
  either through abstract routines or more directly
- Portable
- Extensible
- A language with a secure reference implementation which may be used
  freely by developers (i.e. it is unencumbered by things like GPL or
  other licenses that may inhibit development)
- Reasonably efficient

and so on.  I don't know of anything that comes closer to meeting
these requirements today, or shows promise for doing so in the near
future, than Safe-Tcl.  You can use Safe-Tcl to retrieve a program
from a server and run WWW-oriented code on it today.  Is anyone
actually working on a Safe-Scheme, or Safe-Perl, or
Safe-Scripting-Language-Like-C or Safe-Python?  How's it going?

We can argue all day about how "it should be scheme-like" or "it
should be more object-oriented" but unless some effort at actually
developing the thing is underway NOW, it's a non-starter.  We want
this to actually be working and in widespread use in a reasonably
small number of years.

Python scores high on this list -- it is easy to learn, has sufficient
power, already supports a number of GUIs (from curses via Motif to
Tk), is portable (including Macs and PCs), extensible in C/C++,
embeddable, has powerful built-in operations that make it efficient
for most usage, and the reference implementation is free and
unencombered by GNU.  There is also considerable support for WWW and
Internet protocols in the standard library, as well as support for
multimedia data types (e.g. image and sound files and -- on some
platforms -- drivers).

The main obstacle would be developing the current implementation into
a secure version.  All built-in functions that can modify the file
system would have to be modified so that they can optionally refuse to
function.  I am developing several ideas for this, based on the
approaches for other interpreted languages, but maybe it's more
appropriate to discuss that on comp.lang.python...

Subject: ISO charsets; Unicode
content-length: 3212

Has a formal mechanism been considered for specifying various popular
coding standards, such as ISO 8859-7, ISO 8859-8, etc., and (perhaps
off in the future) Unicode?

Might be possible to use SGML entities for every conceivable character
in every conceivable language, but as a practical solution to a current
problem, this seems difficult at best.

The motivation for this question is essentially this:  Several really
exciting developments are being stymied by the Web's largely ASCII/
English-only focus.  As I discussed privately with several readers of
this forum, there is, for example, a project afoot (nearly complete)
to create a full lexicon and concordance of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  I
imagine a system where users can look up words, and view the original
scrolls as inlined images.  The problem is that the DSS are written
in Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew.  Specially hacked clients are only just
recently arriving that can do Japanese and a few other languages.  No
general solution exists.  And (perhaps most importantly) there is no-
thing in the HTML(+) descriptions that allows one to specify when text
in one language ends and text in another begins, or to specify what
encoding system is being used for either.  The few hacked clients I've
seen also are not really geared for display of arbitrary languages.

The DSS project isn't the only one that appears stymied.  There is a
Cushitic etymological database (say that with a mouth full) at the U
of Chicago that's machine readable, and comes replete with a standard
interface.  The project head would be happy to plug it into the Web,
but again the Web only knows ASCII.

Other projects afoot are a comprehensive Aramaic dictionary.  Aramaic
is the language of parts of the biblical book of Daniel and Ezra, and
a stray verse in Jeremiah.  There is a huge corpus of early Christian
literature written in it, as well as several fundamental Jewish docu-
ments like the Talmud.

Then, of course, there's the giant database project called ARTFL, which
essentially attempts to make the entire French literary corpus availa-
ble online.  It's already here, and tied to the Web.  But they have no
standard specs for how to allow users to input things as simple as an
accute accent over an "a".  They have an extremely competent staff to
work on such problems - but I wonder:  Should this _be_ a problem?

I suppose I shouldn't bend anyone's ears any longer.  Suffice it to say
that there are many, many projects being worked on, and many people
working on them.  A lot of them simply won't be enhancing the Web in the
near future because the Web isn't (yet) really world-wide (in a cultural
or linguistic sense).  Always wanting to bring disciplines together, I'm
led to ask, then:

What ideas have been floated along the lines of making the Web more all-
encompassing, linguistically speaking?  Are there any practical solutions
the folks mentioned above could be working on now?  Where should I direct
people who have questions about internationalization/multilingualism and
the Web?  Can Humanities people help aid the process, even if many of them
are not technically oriented?

The implementation is quite elegant and efficient.  I don't see any good
way of compiling it, altho I have heard of papers discussing it.

It isn't bad once you get used to it, which takes far less time than (say)
getting used to C.  However, elegance has never been a driving
force in acceptance of software, as far as I can tell.

It is (or will soon be) ported to any number of platforms. 

It can be made arbitrarily efficient by replacing larger and larger
subroutines with C code (or whatever code).

> Whatever, the language, the important issues are a secure/safe

Which is already defined for Tcl.  It's called Safe-Tcl.
It's standard, its free, its (pretty) portable, and it works today.
Those are pretty powerful advantages compared to "elegance".


> If we talk about execution on the servers or in caches, then I think
> we need to be concerned about efficiency.

Have you ever actually used Tcl and measured its efficiency? One of the 
really stifling trends I see nowadays is people who insist on using cruft 
like C on the grounds of "efficiency" before ever actually trying it to 
see if such low-level solutions are necessary.

We should be concerned about it, but the solution is not to chose an ugly 
language that can be made efficient with sufficient care, but to chose a 
good interface (e.g., CGI vs C++). With that in place, efficiency can be 
improved where and as needed, rather than requiring everyone to go thru 
contortions trying to make code running as Root in C++ secure just 
because a few dozen server sites are overloaded.

Yes. This is still an open question in SafeTcl, since it was primarily 
designed for email applications.  I would be interested in hearing what 
ideas you might have on this front.   -- Darren

Not so, the Web knows only ISO 8859-1 (so if you send it ASCII it will work) but 
that is not the same thing.

I agree with much of the posting, but:

I suggest you check this. ISO 8859-1 covers most western European languages and 
should certainly do French. "A acute" is doable already and has been since the 
Web started. See for example

<http://info.mcc.ac.uk/CGU/staff/lilley/charset.html>

> They have an extremely competent staff to

Not in this particular instance, no. In the general case of Aramaic etc yes it 
is currently a problem. There has been some discussion on the list before about 
this: I seem to remember that we learned that SGML does not have the expressive 
power to say that this here paragraph is in ISO 8859-9 or shift-JIS or whatever.

   Perhaps its time to get more people to support multipart/x-www-form-data
as the submission method?  I added this to the emacs-w3 browser as a
template for doing user-defined ENCTYPE attributes for forms.  Its
relatively handy, but no servers that I know of support it yet.  This went
around www-talk about 2 months ago, not sure who proposed the
x-www-form-data type though.

  The basic format is:

POST /cgi-bin/foobar HTTP/1.0
[more http headers]
Content-type: multipart/x-www-form-data; 
	      separator=-some-separator-for-www-form-data

---some-separator-for-www-form-data
Content-id: NAME of form <input> tag

the raw form data for the specific <input> tag

---some-separator-for-www-form-data
Content-id: next NAME

raw form data

As people mention alternatives like this, I'd appreciate pointers to
background info on them.

No, you won't... ;-)  I have a hard time seeing HTML remaining any kind of
standard if it tries to go in a direction that its creators never
envisioned.  Worse, it would diverge from SGML and I'll bet we'd see the
Web fragment accordingly.

At the risk of repeating myself, I have to say that I really don't think
this is an either/or proposition.  Look at the announcement Sun just made
-- it is standardizing on SGML *and* Acrobat.  Acrobat wasn't intended to
be a UI language, either.  It will go its own direction.

Clearly this needs to happen, but if they're just plug-ins with freedom to
implement UIs any old way, then we might lose the Web's primary value
(IMO), which is standard, cross-platform UI.

I think we're begging a question here about the future of browsers.  Do
they become window managers or something even more complex?  The trouble
right now is that there's not even a standard way to open another window;
we're stuck with forms that scroll, so that the limited UI features can't
even stay place!

>There may be battles between 2 and 3 if not designed well.

Battles can be avoided if the community comes to accept the need to embrace
multiple UI models for multiple document and navigational paradigms.  In
the end, we have to do what users want, whether we call them users,
publishers, customers, advertisers or whatever.

 Folks,

 after hacking a bit Perl, CGI and UDP, I've done a little package that could
allow a speaker using HTML slides in a conference to multicast them over the
net, and people to follow the session with Mosaic.

 Further informations are in <http://champagne.inria.fr/MCM/>.

 I'd appreciate your feedback (any taker for Chicago ?).

Thanks for the correction.

Still, is the general problem of multi-language text worth dis-
cussing?  For my part, I'd love to make a few of my non-English
databases available online, but I don't know how to tell query
forms to expect something other than ISO 8859-1.

Let me just toss off a suggestion here.  Say we suddenly move
from English to Greek text:

<language Greek encoding="ISO 8859-8">

Here's another exigency that must be handled.  Arabic, Hebrew, etc.
run right-left:

<language Arabic encoding="ISO 8859-7" wrap="right-left">

The reason the "wrap" must be specified is that it is possible to
do, say, Arabic in one of two ways.  The first is to just code in
the stuff backwards.  The other is to have the first letter in the
sequence come first in the file, and so on.  Both methods are used,
and as I recall the MIME standard (which I read some time ago) al-
lows for both of these methods.

The question for me is just how sophisticated we want clients to
get.  The Web is supposed to be worldwide, to be sure, and this
would seem to imply multilinguality. But how are we supposed to
be sure that all of the requisite fonts, with all of the requisite
registries and encodings, are on every machine?  Let us assume that
we have a client that has run into some text using an encoding sys-
tem for which there is no appropriate local font.  It might be nice
to have a mechanism that:

    1) tells the server what type of client is connected, and requests
       the correct font
    2) gracefully recovers on sections of text for which
        a) the server doesn't have the right font for that client, or
        b) the client can't grok the display parameters (e.g. it can't
           do up-down scripts in the same document as left-right ones,
           or can't do up-down at all)

It would be wrong to assume that everyone using the Web will use the
same language all the time, or only want to view text in one language
at a time (consider the common case of an English-Arabic or Japanese-
English dictionary).  Yet it would be equally wrong to expect every
client on every micro to handle every possible case, and to do so all
at once.

I'm sorry if I seem to be obtruding in a forum without knowing what I
am doing.  As I noted above, I'm in the Humanities, and am simply try-
ing to see if I can be any help at all....

Feedback would be much appreciated.

Rob -
 Thanks a lot for your bug reports; I'll buy you a drink at the web conference.

 I fixed those problems just before I left for my flight, and didn't
have time to mail you before my ride dragged me away from the
keyboard. 

I've also got code to make the dates nice and pretty again - however I'm redoing
it due to compatibility problems between 2.3 and 2.4 (strftime is not 
multi-threaded safe under 2.3, which is why I didn't use it originally). The real
problem is tzset, which is called by most of the date formatting routines,
and which messes with global variables without locking them under 2.3. 

I'm  currently in England at Sunsite UK which lives at Imperial College 
(sunsite - it's everywhere you want to be). I've been doing some 
patching and may do some more stuff later this week. I'll be checking Email
reasonably frequently. If you need to contact me, I can be reached at 
+44-81-500-3000 (fax/voice) and +44-81-500-0067 (voice only). The UK is 8
hours ahead of Mt. View.

Good question! This is HTML+ discussion text, from
<URL:http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_13.html>:

    By default, HTML+ documents are made up of 8-bit characters
    from the ISO 8859 Latin-1 character set. The network protocol
    used to retrieve documents may translate the character set into
    a locally acceptable form, e.g. EBCDIC. The HTTP protocol uses
    the MIME standard (RFC 1341) to specify the document type and
    character set. ISO SGML entity definitions are used to include
    characters which are missing from the character set or which
    would otherwise be confused with markup elements...

    Appendix II lists a broad range of characters and symbols,
    relating their ISO names to the corresponding character codes
    in common character sets. They allow authors to include
    accented characters in 7-bit ASCII documents. ...

    There are a large number of entities defined by the ISO,
    covering most languages and symbols for publishing and
    mathematics. Requiring all browsers to support these would
    be impractical, e.g. how should a dumb terminal show such
    symbols. In some cases there will be accepted ways of
    mapping them to normal characters, e.g. <aelig> as ae and
    <egrave> as e. Perhaps the safest recommendation is that
    where authors need to use a specialised character or
    symbol, they should use ISO entity names rather than
    inventing their own. Browsers should leave unrecognised
    entity names untranslated.

That is all I have found on this subject - not much.

A very important matter here is the choice of language:

   (1) in the client
   (2) in the documents

For (1) we must urge the client developers to make their
program internationalized - preferably through the standardized
"i18n" methods. Some work is being done for at least Mosaic (in
Germany and in Sweden), but apparently not in cooperation with
the developing team, with all the disadvantages that entails.

Concerning (2), I have looked in the plans for future HTML and
HTTP and found (in
<URL:http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html>)
that a HTTP request can contain

    Accept-Language: <list>

which is a list of "Language values which are preferable in the
response". In
<URL:http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html>
the parallell specification in the "Object MetaInformation"
contained in the "header fields given with or in relation to
objects in HTTP" is given as

    Content-Language: <code>

This seems nice, I have just the following comment:

Make both of these conformant with the suggested
Content-Language header (draft-ietf-mailext-lang-tag-00.txt?),
with the semantic difference that the value for Accept-Language
is a user's priority list for desired language.

Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT OF CERN LIBRARY OF COMMON CODE 2.17
content-length: 6967


                          *  *  *  *  *

  The CERN Common WWW Library is a general code base that can be used
  as a basis for WWW clients and servers. It contains code for accessing
  HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system. 
  Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting
  hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic programming
  utilities.

                          *  *  *  *  *

This release is the last major release of the CERN Library based upon a 
completely single-threaded data model. It is released to support the
new releases of the CERN server and the Line Mode Browser. The Library is
no longer a part of the CERN Server distribution file but must be down
loaded explicitly from out server. This gives more freedom to put out
new releases of parts of the CERN software from the WWWteam without 
interference.

CERN Common Code Library 2.17 is available as source code from:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_2.17.tar.Z

Its is known to compile on Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake, NeXT, NeXT-386,
Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI and AIX, but look also at the page
of supported platforms at:

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Platform/Platform.html

The library now contains support for a broad stectrum of platform.
PC's are next!

Diffs and old versions are available at

        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/old
        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/diffs

The top-node for documentation on the library is available at 

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html and

Programmer's Guide is available at

CERN Library 2.17 Release Notes

New or Changed Features:

* The host-cache is now extended so that it tries _all_ IP-addresses
  before it fails the request. It always starts with the fastest IP-address.
  Different penelty is added to the connect times dependent of the errno
  returned from connect().

* In addition to HTSimplify which canonicalizes the URL path, a new
  function now canonicalizes the host-part of the URL. This means that URLs
  like

        http://info/ = http://info.cern.ch:80/ = http://INFO.CeRn.CH/ =
        http://info.cern.ch. = http://info.cern.ch/

  now all are treated identical. This is usefull for all the caches
  based on URLs such like the Server document cache and the hostname cache

* TRACE is now differentiated into a bit flag so that TRACE messages
  can be turned on and off for individual groups of messages. This was
  necessary as the amount of verbose output was growing too much

* Redirection understands now `URI:' and `Location:'. Implemented
  after discussion on www-talk

* Changed 404 Error Message to `Access Forbidden'. The URL is no more
  included in the message as it is sensitive information

* FTP client now sends full email address of the user as the password
  for anonymous access instead of USER@. This allows access to some servers
  which don't accept the old format

* The data connection in a FTP session is now based on the return
  value sent by the PASV return code rather than the URL. It is not
  always the case that the data connection is on the same host as the 
  control connection

* UserID and Passwd in FTP URLs can now contain special characters,
  like '@' etc.

* The Gopher listings are now slightly lighter and don't contain the
  `name' and `files' any more

* Support of Gopher info items. They are treated as normal messages.
  The gopher code for this is `i'

* WAIS module now guesses the stream format when TEXT is returned from
  the WAIS library as it might be HTML.

* The Protocol modules: FTP, WAIS, and Gopher now produce proper HTML
  with <HTML><HEAD> etc. in the beginning

* Added a function that returns the domain name taken from the same 
  location as HTGetHostName(). The functionality of obtaining current
  host names, mail addresses etc. have improved, see HTTCP.html for more

* Introduced the flag HTInteractive in HTAccess.html to tell whether
  functions in HTAlert can prompt the User from within the Library or
  not. Default is YES.

* The common BUILD for the Line Mode Browser, the CERN Server and the Library
  of common code now accepts a command line option:

        BUILD linemode | daemon | library

  to build a specific component. The default action is to build all three
  parts.  BUILD is now also provided in a Bourne Shell version

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed memory leak in HTWAIS Doc retrival. However, the functionality
  or performance has not changes

* If no host is found in the URL then no attempt is made to connect
  to host 0.0.0.0 that is localhost. Some hosts do have an alias for
  this address

* Fixed free memory read in redirections. Put redirection counter into
  request structure. Now no more than (default) 10 redirections are allowed

* Fixed bug in FTP module to handle really slow hosts in the select
  call. The select timed out without the right action taken.

* FTP module choped off the first line of a Windows NT ftp server as
  it doesn't send a traditional first UNIX line. Fixed! Well, it _did_
  look like UNIX, but no more than that :-(

* Problem in HTTeXGen. Some markups was spread over a new line, and LaTeX
  doesn't like that.

* Remove the ACCESS_AUTH define as it is never used anymore (no more 
  compilation without access autehntication)

* Fixed bug in the ISO Latin 1 translation table in HTML.c. This was a
  problem for estonian documents or other with many special characters

* Fixed bug in HTSimplify not skipping host names. HTSimplify is made faster
  and is now only called once (both from the server and the client). Before
  it was called 2-3 times.

* Bug found in FTP URLs containing UserID and Passwd fixed 

* Bug fixed in name generation in client cache

* Removed bug in FTP and IP-rotation on multi-homed hosts. When FTP
  server is in PASV mode it sends back a port number on a specific
  host. In this case we can't use IP-address rotation.

* Bug with FTP IP-address network order fixed for PASV mode

* Gopher errors (code 3) are now just put as a string as they are not
  _real_ error

* Bug fixed in HTWriter.c function flush() where a partial success in
  NETWRITE would produce a wrong output (repeated buffer)

                              *  *  *  *  *

  The CERN Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web Browser.
  It is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for the
  CERN Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non-
  interactive mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety
  of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is
  primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or
  used in batch jobs.

			      *	 *  *  *  *

CERN Line Mode Browser 2.15 is available, source code:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_2.15.tar.Z

Precompiled binaries are available for Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake,
NeXT, NeXT-386, Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI and AIX. They can be
found at

CERN Line Mode Browser Release Notes

As always, most of the added features in the Line Mode Browser are a
result of changes to the CERN Library of Common Code. However, the
following new features deserve to be mentioned:

* Introduced a more sophisticated verbose mode that takes parameter
  after the -v option. This feature is implemented due to an excessive
  amount of verbose output from the Library and the Browser. The -v
  option can now be followed by none, one, or more of the following
  characters:

	a  Anchor relevant information
	p  Protocol Modules
	s  SGML/HTML information
	u  URI management

  The -v flag alone turns on all trace messages. This feature is a
  result of a more advanced TRACE management in the Library of
  Common Code

* LineMode Browser now supports direct WAIS access. If it is compiled
  with the same WAIS flags in the Makefile as the CERN server then it
  can access a WAIS server directly.

* New command line feature: -m <method> where <method> is one of

	GET or HEAD

  This will later get extended to also include other HTTP methods

* Cyrillic support added for Line Mode Browser. This is a patch from
  Anton Tropashko, agl@glas2.glas.apc.org

* Bug where the Browser prompted the user a UserID and Password in
  non-interactive mode fixed. Now non-interactive _really_
  means non-interactive.

* The common BUILD for the Line Mode Browser, the CERN Server and the Library
  of common code now accepts a command line option:

	BUILD linemode | daemon | library

  to build a specific component. The default action is to build all three
  parts. BUILD is now also provided in a Bourne Shell version

                           *  *  *  *  *

  CERN httpd is a generic hypertext server which can be used as a
  regular HTTP server running typically on port 80 to serve hypertext
  and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a firewall
  machine -- that provides access for people inside a firewall to the
  outside world.  When running as proxy httpd may be configured to
  do caching of documents resulting in faster response times and lower
  impact on the network traffic to the outside world.

                           *  *  *  *  *

CERN httpd 3.0 is now available. You can get the source code from

        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/WWWDaemon.tar.Z

Note that this package DOESN'T contain the CERN Library. This must be
down loaded from

        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/WWWLibrary.tar.Z

An announcement of a new release of the library is made together with
this one. Many of the BUG-fixes and new features are a part of this library.

Precompiled binaries are available for Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake,
NeXT, NeXT-386, Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI and AIX. They can be
found at

        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin

Look also at the list of other platforms supported at

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Platform/Platform.html

Precompiled binaries with direct WAIS access are available for both
Sun4 and Solaris. If the daemon is used without direct WAIS access then
it goes to our server at

	http://info.cern.ch:8001

This server has been there for a while but due to heavy overload on
info, PLEASE get your own WAIS gateway. See more information on this
at

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/WAISGate.html

Furthermore, there is a cern_httpd_3.0-lresolv.tar.Z for Sun4
which contains an httpd linked with the -lresolv option.

Remember that the binaries for utility programs (htadm, htimagem
cgiparse, and cgiutils) are distributed in a separate file in
	
        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin

CERN Httpd 3.0 Release Notes

* The common BUILD for the Line Mode Browser, the CERN Server and the Library
  of common code now accepts a command line option:

        BUILD linemode | daemon | library

  to build a specific component. The default action is to build all three
  parts. BUILD is now also provided in a Bourne Shell version

* Added
        - IconPath
        - AddIconToStd

  as directives in the configuration file. The first one allows to redirect
  the standard icons to another server without having to do the installation
  manually. The second allows to add a icon to the standard set. This
  is handy if a single icon is to be added for a specific MIME-type

* Also added the `LogFileDateExt' as a new configuration directive. It
  specifies a common time/date extension for all the logfiles. Spaces
  in the format are converted to `_`

* Logfiles are now opened with a O_APPEND option on UNIX platforms. This 
  should prevent child processes from writing to the log file at the
  same time

* Bug in `\ ' parsing fixed in config file

* Bug in password recognition fixed. This ensures no more endless loops!

* Fixed bug on GMT time calculation (thanks to Michael Fischer)

* Increased the BACKLOG number of the listen command from 5 to 32 -
  thanks to Simon E Spero, ses@tipper.oit.unc.edu.

* Error messages are always of type www/html. They were not initialized
  in the previous release.

* Removed all use of inet_ntoa(). This function causes BIG problems on
  many platforms

* Fixed bug in AddBlankIcon (now understands both with and w/o ALT tag)

* The '*' is not a valid alias for `All' in this release. 

* Max linelength for any line in the config file is now put to 1024 characters

* Bug in Timezone calculation for sysV fixed, thanks to Rainer Klute

* Bug in redirection fixed. Now any search information is also
  returned as a part of the redirection

* The no-linger will not be turned off as it is needed on some
  platforms, e.g. the UTS

* Bug when calling a script with no name, that is "" fixed

* Cache garbage collection now falls back to default value 3.00am if
  wrong date format given (was turned off completely)

* incorporated Lauren Weinstein's (second) ISC 3.0 changes

* This time Makefiles really don't have includes left

* HTPut.c no longer in the distribution (confused Imake)

* CacheSize automatically taken to be 90% of the given value (10% has been
  experimentally seen to be the amount of diskspace taken up by the
  directory structure and cache info files, and allows a suitable margin)

* Memory problem on AIX platform in buf_put_char() fixed

* Updated ICE package from http://www.igd.fhg.de/~neuss/me.html.
  Example http://www.igd.fhg.de/htbin/ice-form.pl

* Now zombies should be avoided on SVR3 platforms

Yes, a group of us are working on this, and we're finally making
progress.  Most of the group are from MIT, which should surprise
no one, and I'm the lone California member.

However, our initial target was for use with network management and our
goal has been means by which one machine can get a remote machine to
act on its behalf, even if the net is partitioned.  This is, I think,
quite a different thing than a "smart document" (which is what I think
we are talking about on these lists.)

We are finding security to be a real tough nut to crack. In our
definition, programs can create yet more programs on other machines.
It's necessary to add mechanisms to keep track of chains of privilege
and prevent mutations, etc.  simply having a "safe" execution
environment isn't enough if it is possible to establish a collection
of interacting machines which is not also "safe".

I suspect before we get into picking a language we really ought to
cogitate for a while and try to understant how much power we want to
put into smart documents.

Well. I never intended to start a flame war, nor indeed a war about
languages. More than anything else, I'd like to see *forms* be
dynamic, or more precisely, over what is sent to the server.

SGML (of which HTML is one particular use),
is *great* for WWW, and I would hate to see it replaced by a full
scripting language *now*, because on the horizon (10 years maybe) we
have distributed object systems which are *far* better than sending
nice little "candy-grams" (as one repondent calls them).

I should not ethat about 3 years or so ago I *did* implement a system
based on the "candy-gram" model. It was a full cooperative,
distributed environment, and we solved the security problems primarily
via virtual machines and instruction set limitations. This system was
*very* nice; there were not so much client and servers as "peers"
working together. The emergent behavior in some cases was
interesting....

Sadly, I *cannot* give out details, and the system will probably *not*
get out from underneath the politics and misunderstanding above it...

That work was *not* EBT, and no, EBT doen't listen to me, so my
opinions are meaningless to them... :-)

Yes, it is a parameter to the text/xxx content type:-

Or some such stuff.

This is a Mosaic problem, not a WWW problem. Mosaic can handle multiple

Hacked versions afor any particular language are easy to come by. There
is no browser that can display english, greek and Hebrew together at
present. This will change. At some point the difficult question of 
mixing left/right scanning languages will have to be tackled.

Here I suspect you need something quite a bit more sophisticated and which
is at least 6 months off. You need a highly modular browser and drop in your
own module into it. That type of research tends to need highly specialised
fonts and a lot more flexibility that first sight might imply.

Again for any ancient language I suspect you will need multiple character
sets for different periods, different script styles etc. RFC-822 is pretty
much the same in gothic or helvetica. But if you are discussing an ancient
text typeface questions can be very critical. This is especially so with
cuenniform or hyroglyphic texts.

If the browser is a good one it should understand the accents in standard
ISO code as well as as entities. The entities are pretty much redundant
for a, v etc unless you have a derraged transport that is not 8 bit clean.

Well since a large number of developers here have funny accents in their
name as I suspect your forebears would have done (Gvrwitz) extended Latin
is pretty much catered  for. Greek is essential for the maths and so will
go in. Hebrew characters will probably arrive before mixing right/left
scanning.

If the 7bit mail transport strips off the accents then you might not
understand some of the above bits...

Wouldn't this benefit from the Content-length instead of separators?
Especially since the browser knows the lengths of all items before
submission.  i.e:

Content-type: multipart/x-www-form-data

Content-id: Name
Content-length: 8
Raw Data
Content-id: AnotherName
Content-length: 15
More Raw Data

Content-id: etc etc...

Sure.  Pull up Dave Bridgham's page:

	http://www.epilogue.com/~dab

And follow the pointers to scheme and the scheme underground.

It's an amazingly powerful and concise language -- I have trouble
with it because my brain is stuck in C/C++ styles.

There are a fair number of implementations out there, some with X11
toolkits.  It is efficient enough that it is in some experimental RMON
network monitors which have to operate in quasi-real-time.

Let me know if you need more pointers.

Glad to here that you are interested.

By-the-way, what part of the world contains Verity?  Are you in the SF Bay

  I think you need both in a multipart message, don't you?  Forgot to put
in the content-length in my example code - will change that this afternoon.

Hi!  Sorry I missed you at Interop.  I was too busy in the NOC to spend
much time on the show floor

Anyway...

An elegant implementation of an interpreter is a long way from saying
the same thing about the language itself.

Please don't take me as an anti-TCL bigot.  Rather, I'm concerned that
as we load servers with more and more interpretable blocks of code
that what are tolerable levels of overhead will be vastly multiplied.
(The standard warning in http daemon configuration documents that
running the daemon from inetd might not be desirable is a similar
forewarning.)

The concern I have about "safe" environments is that they often do not
consider the interactions which can occur between machines, i.e. as
things travel across "safe" boundaries.  We find this kind of problem
all the time in network security where people hook up machines running
secure operating systems over an encrypted network.  Because the
secure environments aren't coordinated, it is possible to introduce
information which has different meaning in the various security
contexts and hence cause a secrutity violation.  This often happens if
the different machines have different privileges attached to the same
user ids or user names, for example.

Yes, I've seen many Sparcstation 10s sinking under the load.

I did an interesting comparision, a TCL/TK program that did some bit
map drawing and the ELK Scheme toolkit (that also has X operations
built-in).  The Scheme (Lisp) based approach ran circles (drew
circles?) around the TCL/TK engine.

I quite agree with your point about finding the slow spots and then
optimizing.  If I didn't believe that I would still be using assembly
language.

However, as someone else mentioned, the value of TCL is that it gives
a means to express the sequence of execution, which just about all
languages can do.  And hence the value of TCL/TK is in TK, not TCL.

And I don't think that we are talking about documents that have
built-in X11 display operations?

But we are getting in a language war here, which is not what this list
is all about.

I haven't seen anyone advocating C or anything like it.  I'm surprised
I haven't seen anyone mention (I hope I'm not hit by lightning for
this) Microsoft's Visual Basic.

One interesting side point about languages like Scheme is that they
are so small that it may be possible to build tools that can validate
that the program itself is safe rather than wrapping it in run-time
checks.  But this is starting into proof-of-correctness territory, a
black art I haven't practiced in some years.

Ah, finally what I do want to talk about.  But first, I think we
really need to understand how smart documents will interact with one
another or spawn one another, if they do so at all, or how cgi-scripts
interact with other cgi-scripts, if they do so at all.

The stuff I've been working on allows the creator of a
script-in-execution to have enough control over that script to kill it
or replace it.  I don't know that this is a relevant concern to this
group except insofar as these kinds of things make really nice web
search engines.  (I'm working with controlled worm programs -- it's
time to dust off the old copy of Shockwave Rider.)

As I understand i18n, it is not suitable for anything we should
be envisioning for WWW.  It is not a multilingual standard,
but a method for helping software developers localize their sys-
tems.  The distinction here is critical.  Localization is the
process of gearing a package for one specific locale.  This is
not a method for generalizing display methods for multilingual
use.

However, let me add that Motif supposedly has code for bidirec-
tional text widgets.  That is, it can theoretically handle text that
includes right-left and left-right wordwrapping text.  So, for
example, you could write a bilingual Arabic-English or Hebrew-
English dictionary, and expect to find facilities there for
quoting both languages in the same document (same entry, in
fact).

I should emphasize, though, that I am not a Motif programmer,
and I am told that the code described above was ifdef'd out
in the current distribution because it wasn't considered fully
debugged.  The next release may have it enabled.  I also know
nothing about mixed up-down and right-left or left-right lang-
uages.

Well, if you're talking about uploading Tcl to the server from a client, 
that's one thing. You're going to need some sort of scripting language, 
and Tcl is nice because you can add new operations in assembler, C, shell 
scripts, or whatever you want.  Indeed it was designed for that, unlike 
other languages (scheme springs to mind) wherein their environment is 
closed but can be openned.

Well, you can take a SafeTcl program from anywhere and run it under your 
userID without even looking at the source, and know that it's not going 
to read files without you giving permission, send mail, print, lock up 
your terminal, etc etc etc.

Sure. But I think that's way off the topic of what we're talking about.  
There, the two networks trust each other, yet the owners thereof screw 
up. I am talking about when you *don't* trust the other person.  That's 
much easier.

But the server isn't going to be running Tk stuff.  The client will be 
running Tk stuff.

In which case the efficiency of Tk doesn't really matter, since it would 
be the client running it, not the server.

Well, X11-like operations, in the same sense that Mosaic has X11-like forms.

No.

As I see it, there's three languages here.

1) The interface between the server and server-written code. We already 
have one, called CGI.

2) Programs that people send to a server from untrusted clients to be 
executed on the server's hardware. This I would think should be an 
easily-extendible language. This seems like the kind of thing where 
either an operation doesn't get executed very often (in which case it's 
better to interpret it) or it's something that should be compiled in (in 
which case you want to extend the language, or use 1 above). 

3) Programs imbedded in documents to be sent back to clients, like 
sophisticated forms. In this case, efficiency isn't much of a concern, 
since you're already running X and stuff, and there's only so many 
programs whose output you can watch at once.

Since #2 is the real efficiency-problem, it's clear that Tk isn't the 
problem, at least to me.  The problem is the efficiency of the code 
runing on the server on behalf of the clients.  Since the kinds of stuff 
I'd let people run on my server without checking it fall into a few 
categories, I would think I could extend my language to cover them 
efficiently, just imagining for 5 minutes off the top of my head.

SafeTcl's approach is to remove all elements from the language which are 
unsafe, then allow the server (in our discussion) to chose to add them 
back in a controlled way.  No validation *or* runtime-checks.

(I can't imagine letting untrusted people run programs on my machine for 
their benefit that take so long it's faster to prove they're safe than it 
is to check at run-time.)

Yes!  Yes!  With a good interface between, the language matters much less.

Well, if people here aren't interested, I'd certainly like to take it to 
private email.  I've been interested in safe distributed languages for a 
while now.  -- Darren

ISO 2022 and ISO TR 9573 describe methods of charset shifting
for use in SGML.  The TEI has developed an approach, too.  
And SGML Open (the consortium of vendors) has a committee on
the issue.  

For the Docbook DTD we've decided that to handle element-level
charset shifts we need CHARSET, LANG, and COUNTRY common attributes.
But shifting between charsets at arbitrary points is more 
complicated, and we've been waiting for SGML Open to indicate
the manner in which vendors are willing to support it, so haven't
implemented anything.

I'm enclosing below my "official blurb" on what is happening in my new
group at Sun.  Tcl and Tk will be competitive with Visual Basic in the
sense that they make it easy to build GUI applications, and in the sense
that they'll have a GUI builder.  However, the Sun work is targeted at
networks and multi-platform scripting, which are currently outside
Visual Basic's range.  In this sense I don't see head-to-head competition
with VB.

Here's the blurb:

The Tcl/Tk project that I'm heading at Sun has the long-term goal
of making Tcl and Tk into a universal scripting language for the
Internet.  You will be able write scripts (both GUI and non-GUI)
that will run unchanged on any machine in the Internet.  If they
are GUI, they will present themselves using the native look and
feel of the platform on which they execute.  Tcl will provide a
secure execution environment so that you will be able to execute
incoming scripts without fear of viruses or other damage to your
machine, even if you don't trust the source of the scripts.  As
authentication mechanisms become available, Tcl will use them to
allow a variety of levels of trust of incoming scripts.

We think that a universal scripting language will enable many
exciting new applications.  One example is active documents.  An
active document is one that contains both the data of the document
and a set of scripts to control its presentation and propagation.
The document can be delivered to a recipient by many mechanisms,
such as e-mail or the World-Wide Web.  Its scripts can then be
executed so that it can interact graphically with the recipient.
Once the interaction is complete, the document's scripts can take
other actions such as making entries in databases.  The scripts
can also forward the document elsewhere around the network.  Active
documents subsume work-flow applications as a subset, but they could
also be used for purposes such as active advertisements.

The Sun Tcl/Tk team will be carrying out the following projects over
the short term (6-12 months?):

1. Port both Tcl and Tk to Macintoshes and Windows.
2. Incorporate dynamic loading and the Safe-Tcl security extensions
   back into the Tcl core.
3. Develop an interactive GUI builder for Tk like Visual Basic or
   NextStep.

Over the longer term we hope to do some or all of the following
additional projects:

4. Build an on-the-fly compiler for Tcl scripts (should yield a
   10-20x performance improvement in many cases).
5. Improve Tcl/Tk internationalization to handle Asian character
   sets.
6. Build other development tools such as debuggers, test coverage
   analyzers, etc.
7. Develop interesting applications such as active documents.

Our policy is that all of the core facilities for executing Tcl scripts,
such as the Mac and PC ports, Safe-Tcl, etc. will always be distributed
freely, without any restrictions.  Of course, Sun has to make money off
of this somehow, otherwise it won't be able to continue funding development.
Most likely this will happen by making products out of applications and
development tools like the GUI builder.  It's likely that some of these
will be distributed freely in source form at first, but as they mature
and turn into products, sources may stop being available and you'll have
to pay to use them.

Right now I don't have a detailed schedule for any of the projects,
nor can I give specifics about eventual products or licensing terms,
except to say that the core Tcl/Tk engines will always be free.  The
project is currently located in Sun Microsystems Laboratories, the
research arm of the company, and there are not yet any official
product commitments from the Sun product organizations.  I'll make
more information available as we figure it out.

I've been messing around with SIOD (Scheme In One Defun) for a few
weeks.  It is unencumbered (as near as I can tell).

You can grab it from

ftp://ftp.std.com/pub/gjc/

It is small and very easy to extend by adding new functions using C;
I have already created some basic graphics and network functions.

I'm not sure what it would take to make siod safe.  I assume
that all that is needed is to remove the functions that modify
files which should be pretty easy to do.

WINTERP -- the OSF/Motif Widget INTERPreter -- is available via anonymous
ftp from ftp.x.org /contrib/devel_tools/winterp-2.XX.tar.gz (where XX=03
currently). You can also get a slightly older version (2.00) from the X
Consortium's X11r6 distribution. WINTERP is free software available under
the standard X Consortium non-restrictive copyright.

WINTERP home page:
	http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterp.html
WINTERP introductory blurb:
	http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterpIS.html

In the past, we've demonstrated that WINTERP can be used for supporting
"smart" forms-based interfaces in an e-mail based groupware system called
STRUDEL. STRUDEL is "distributed" system, meaning that forms interpretation
and processing happens entirely on the "client side" since there is no
centralized server...

        Allan Shepherd, Niels Mayer, and Allan Kuchinsky.  STRUDEL: An
        Extensible Electronic Conversation Toolkit. In David Marca and

        (originally, in proceedings Conference on Computer-Supported
        Cooperative Work, Los Angeles, October 1990, pp.  93-104.)

Another example of WINTERP useage is EIT's HTML Multimedia Authoring
environment:

	http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/link-anchor-br.gif

--------------------

I've been thinking about embedding WINTERP into Mosaic such that you can
have real user interfaces in place of Mosaic forms and hairy CGI scripts;
furthermore, you could use WINTERP's graphics/animation widget to create
dynamic, animated interfaces, "smart" image mapping, etc.

Embedding WINTERP in Mosaic is pretty easy, since they're both just Motif
programs sharing the same Xt event loop. Slightly harder, but still pretty
easy is getting WINTERP-generated widgetry to display in-line. The hardest
part is security.  Obviously, to make something like this useable, you want
to either make the UI "applet" language safe and secure (a la safe-TCL), or
make use of secure HTTP to authenticate any "applet" programs running on
the client side. 

Unfortunately, I don't have much time to work on stuff like that since I'm
spending my full 110% trying to get the aforementioned WWW authoring
environment to beta....

However, I'd be happy to give people pointers on embedding WINTERP into
Mosaic, since I don't have time to do it myself.

The viola language system is "object-oriented" (not pure in the Smalltalk
sense, but has big object units...). This makes it easy to enforce safety
by a policy of marking imported objects as untrusted. As such, those
imported objects' scripts have no system priviledges, no sub interpreters,
can't coarse other objects to do things in a dangerous way...

It's somewhat C like in syntax, has very simple grammar. It's typeless,
or rather, has automatic conversion and has internal data types (this
has efficiency implications).

The viola system is more GUI centric. But the abstraction could be
knocked up higher such that the GUIs might be more sensibly replaced
by other interfaces (ASCII, voice, etc).

The system has almost no Unix or X ism. Should port very well.

The violaWWW development on this front has been underway for a while now.
Needs refinement, but it's basically already working in ViolaWWW,
in the WWW context, such that applets may be built and linked/embedded
into toolbar or documents.

There's more info in the paper on this.

Apparently so! It's come up several times before, and nobody
has come up with any globally optimal solutions. You'll certainly
want to troll the www-talk archives and see what's been discussed.
For example, you might start with:

Well... the problem isn't how to announce the data format. You can
make up a new MIME type, if you like. The problem is deploying clients
that understand the data type. We just need lots of prototypes.

Jean-Christophe:  YESSSS!  We're very interested, since the conference
registration filled September 1, and we're casting (no pun intended!)
around for alternative technologies that would enable reasonable
participation from remote sites.  I'll pass your posting to our network

I think we have the same concerns, but different emphasis.  We are certainly
in agreement that whatever language is used for #2 it should be extensible
in the sense that it should be possible to recast frequently used operations
into fast primitives.

I've been thinking of using scripts like these to do things like watch
the documents on a server for changes or do other kinds of document
aggregation (i.e. index building.)  Some people would put this into
the clients, but I like the idea of a client having the ability to
inject something into a server that says "do the following...".  I'm
not sure how to build the response path for something like this in the
current http architecture.

I know this is getting towards robot-land... it's sort of like a
roll-your-own robot to run on the server.

And because I've been thinking of potentially long-lived server
scripts, and potentially a lot of them, efficient execution and
minimization of context switch overhead is a big concern to me.
(Especially as I want to see solid servers on inexpensive platforms.)

The interface is the most valuable part; the languages may change, but the
interface will tend to remain for a long time.  Besides, I find that clean
interfaces let people build interesting products in less time.

But I do not have a clear vision how these smart documents or server
scripts or whatever we call them are going to interact with one
another, or whether they should at all.

Subject: ISO, Unicode -> multilinguality
content-length: 3645

Just received an enlightening personal letter.  In it there was one
question worth answering here on www-talk.  In my haste, it simply
did not occur to me that everyone here has the same background as I
do :-)...

>   Here's another exigency that must be handled.  Arabic, Hebrew, etc.

>in the source.)

This is an excellent question.  Why indeed should we ever have to code
backwards?  I've been talking Arabic so far, but consider the case we
often see on Israeli servers.  They often show menus with English at one
end and Hebrew at the other (implying an ISO 8859-8 encoding - you just
have to switch your client over manually).  The do it like this:

                   Menu item 1....................1 meti uneM
                   Menu item 2....................2 meti uneM
                   etc.

Of course the right-hand material would be written in Hebrew.  I just
reversed the English here so everyone would be able to see the point.
All servers assume left-right directionality.  So the only way to get
the English and Hebrew both up is to code the English in forwards, and
enter the Hebrew backwards.

<UL>
  <LI>
    <language English encoding="ISO 8859-1" direction="normal">
      Menu item 1................
    </language>
    <language Hebrew encoding="ISO 8859-8" direction="reverse">
      1 meti uneM
    </language><BR>
  <LI>
    <language English encoding="ISO 8859-1" direction="normal">
      Menu item 2................
    </language>
    <language Hebrew encoding="ISO 8859-8 direction="reverse">
      2 meti uneM
    </language><BR>
</UL>

What we are doing is putting the Hebrew in manually, reversing its
natural or normal order in the underlying file (which should be text
coming first should be coded first - here it is the opposite of that).
Again, if this example were "real," the Hebrew text above would use
high-order characters, as in ISO 8859-8.  Note that the above coding
assumes that some server is not going to break up the line.  Pretty
bad assumption.  Who knows what they'll do.  So that brings us to the
more sensible coding scheme, i.e., to code both English and Hebrew
"forwards," but expect the client to know that when it comes to dis-
playing Hebrew, it's going to run right-left:

<UL>
  <LI>
    <language English encoding="ISO 8859-1" direction="normal">
      Menu item 1................
    </language>
    <language Hebrew encoding="ISO 8859-8" direction="normal">
      Menu item 1
    </language><BR>
  <LI>
    <language English encoding="ISO 8859-1" direction="normal">
      Menu item 2................
    </language>
    <language Hebrew encoding="ISO 8859-8 direction="normal">
      Menu item 2
    </language><BR>
</UL>

I hope this helps get us all on the same page.  As I mentioned, I
believe that the MIME standerd merges in both of these methods.
But I'm no expert.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

The fact that menus like what I described above are being hacked to-
gether on the net shows that the demand is there for bilingual text
(multilingual text, in fact) - this in addition to all of the databse
and dictionary projects I mentioned in earlier postings.

This didn't get much response on www-html (possibly me being naive or 
uninformed) so I thought I'd post it here...   :-)

I know this isn't very "document-like", but could be used to do many 
interesting things on the client side.  A similar idea would be to define a 
secondary page(s) to be opened simultaneously in a separate window(s) as a 
floating toolbar, control panel, table-of-contents, keyword list, etc.  
These would be coordinated by the client so we don't have to keep jumping 
back to the "top".

Any pointers to folks with similar thoughts?  Maybe the individual(s) who 
first proposed Forms and input fields?   I'd rather converse with someone 
who's already involved in the process of evolving HTML, letting them take 
such ideas and meld them into their own, rather than I throwing such things 
at the mailing list piece-meal.

Thanks!

If you haven't noticed, Motif doesn't allow the mixing of character
sets in a single text widget - it takes more than a hack of the client
to display multiple character sets (e.g. Hebrew, Greek, Japanese) on
the same "page."

The only way to do this - I haven't tried - would be to use Mule.

   Is there any way to get lynx to read the news from the spool on disk??

But is this really a solution?  Doesn't this specify a specific char-
acter set for the entire document, and not for arbitrary sections of
text?

Just for the record, most people working with ancient languages would be
happy with a single generic font.  What they'd do is use this for general
transcription, and link in images for those who want to look at the ac-
tual texts.  E.g. Greek and Latin texts are done in a modern typeface,
not in ancient uncial or other script.  Akkadian is similar - in fact
there you can get away with ISO 8859-1 for the transliterations.

It is impossible, though, to put scholarly discussions of the classics,
for example, online until it's possible to encode multilingual texts.
Typical editions of Homer, for instance, have both the Greek text and
an extensive set of modern annotations.  Lest anyone laugh (what? clas-
sical Greek online?), note that virtually the entire classical Greek
corpus is online right now, waiting for the Web to understand multi-
lingual and/or non-ISO-8859-1 text.

Most of the scenarios which I've seen described involve the program
being executed on the client side, though doing things on the server
side is an interesting possiblity (can't think of many scenarios for
it offhand...)  It occurs to me that we might be talking about
entirely different issues.

Part of it depends on the current producer-consumer model.  If you
stick to that, the idea is for the producer to give a level of
interaction that is not practical if continuous server contact is
needed.  The Parc map server is cool and useful, but it would be even
more cool if it could simply send a simple program for browsing a
globe and twiddling the options available (not to mention a lot
faster, fast enough to allow for things like spinning the globe.)

This is what I'm interested in; server-provided, client-executing
programs that allow a greater level of interactivity without breaking
the Web's ease of use, portability, and security.  Forms that are
"smart" about what combinations of choices preclude other choices, or
can provide better feedback for users about what is and is not
appropriate entries.  Animations that are dynamic and interactive, not
static MPEGs.

I don't know if I'd consider this a "safe" environment in that classic
sense.  It's that the functionality of the language is dumbed down
from general-purpose functionality to limited-purpose functionality
that can't do anything potentially harmful.

>And I don't think that we are talking about documents that have
>built-in X11 display operations?

Sure, why not?  It would tend to be better if such low-level details
tended to be abstracted away so the same program could also work under
MS-Windows or other environments, of course.  A well-designed program
should tell what kind of environment it's working in (X11, MS-Windows,
with or without various extensions present, or plain text, or
whatever) and present an appropriate interface as best it can.  (Tk
is, after all, already running under Windows.)

The degree to which people want to do X stuff with WWW is
considerable, as one can tell from the folks who want some
standardized way for a CGI progarm to find out what the DISPLAY of the
client is.  Doing this via a program that runs on the client side
makes things a lot more efficient, interoperable, and secure.

>I haven't seen anyone advocating C or anything like it.  I'm surprised

Well, I don't know of an abstract specification for it, or a free
implementation suitable for use by developers, or a safe version of it
specified or implemented.  That kind of precludes it as a serious
possibility, but not because of the langauge itself per se.

Hmmm.  I guess I consider active objects to be mostly orthogonal to
CGI-scripts (or virtual documents in general.)  The issue of how
multiple programs should interact with each other, if at all, is also
kind of outside the decision of what language to use as long as the
lanaguge can have whatever functionality for interaction is desired
and added.

Ousterhout is planning to integrate Safe-Tcl into the main package in
the medium-term (he was quoting a timeline of six months this summer.)
Tcl/Tk in general is a rather widely employed package, and this means
it's a a reasonable supposition that a significant number of people
will have Safe-Tcl installed on their systems within a year from now.
I know of nothing else with comperable functionality about which this
can be said.

Please don't take me as a pro-Tcl bigot.  What matters to me is that I
can put active objects into anchors and have a nontrivial number of
people click on them and have it work.  If others want to wait for the
Ultimate Scripting Language, OK, but the world will not.

Integrating it, or anything else, smoothly into existing WWW browsers
is another, more difficult task, since most existing clients' designs
are hostile to such integration working in any nontrivial way, but
better clients are a different issue.

Anyone think active objects should have a BOF in Chicago?

I argued for this a long time ago (back when it could have easily become
part of the standard) but nothing ever happened.

My idea was to have a navigation window that would typically be rendered
seperate from the normal contents of the document (but of course, this
would be up to the browser).

The main reason for this was because I wanted my server to add the
standard (forward, back, top) type information on the fly and if there
was a <NAV> section (like <HEAD>...</HEAD><NAV>...</NAV><BODY>...</BODY>)
then I could do this much more easily.  Also, it would be a *MAJOR* feature
if users had easy access to this.

In that way, each document could have it's own custom navigation interface
(or as you say, do any number of other interesting things I've never even
thought about).

(For completeness, can't remember if this got mentioned recently.)
The distribution of specs, background, and reference implementation of
Safe-Tcl is in <ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/mrose/safe-tcl/>.  A couple of
lengthy papers about the language design included are recommended
reading for anyone wishing to design a safe language for active
documents.

I thought this was what the LINK stuff was for...
There are enough LINK types defined to do all the things that NAV could do.
It's just that it's hard to render a LINK...

So we added to our hacked Mosaic browser a little thing that allows us to put
   <LINK HREF="some.url" SRC="url/next.gif" REL="next">
and hence we can render the SRC somewhere out of the way with a link to the 
HREF.  It works well and doesn't take much to add.

Considering the general level of resistance to new body tags, adding a whole
new section to HTML probably won't get far...

In general I agree with this, but it just struck me that there is a
degenerate case in UNIX (where else? :-) ) of named pipes.  A user might
select the named pipe as the file to send and have the data generated by
the program at the other end of the pipe sent to the server (seems like a
sort of useful facility).  The browser won't know the content length a

bit like the server doesn't know the content length of CGI script's output).

You can't, currently. There is the internationalised version of the M-entity by 
Toshihiro Takada <http://www.ntt.jp/Mosaic-l10n/README.html> which addresses 
some of the problems of automatic switching on a *per document* basis. 

I agree that switching on a per-element basis is needed, but as I said SGML does 
not appear to support this. Perhaps the SGML standard could do with an 
ammendment in the light of this?

> Let me just toss off a suggestion here.  Say we suddenly move
> from English to Greek text:

> <language Greek encoding="ISO 8859-8">

I see what you are saying, I have said similar things myself in the past. You 
correctly separate the problem into two sub-problems: changing the language, and 
changing the encoding. 

For example, being able to tag the English, French and Italian sections of a 
document (all using ISO 8859-1) is doable with changes to the DTD. This would 
have desirable consequences in terms of targetted searching, for example.

Changing the encoding cannot apparently be done like this. You cannot express it 
in the DTD. This is a severe limitation. As I have said before, the 
Much-of-Western-Europe-and-the-USA Wide Web is flourishing, but the "World" bit 
is sorely lacking.

A related issue is defining overlaps between languages and their subsets etc. 
There are actually three things to juggle with; the country, the language and 
the encoding (there may be more than one encoding possible).

For example, you may want to tag a section as US English. Or British English. Or 
US Medical English. But it needs to be expressed somehow that people who read 
British English can also understand US English (well, mostly ;-) ). Expressing 
tis as a locale, eg Britain, doesn't help because people here speak Scots Gaelic 
or Welsh or Manx or Romany or Sheltie, in some cases as a first language, and we 
don't want any backdoor cultural imperialism do we ;-(

In case that example was a little too UK-centric for some tastes: expressing 
locale as Switzerland doesn't help becuase the primary language may be Swiss 
German or Swiss French or Swiss Italian (or English if they are at CERN ;-) ) 
and it may in some cases be desirable to distinguish Swiss German from German 
German.

Or again, in the USA a lot of people have Latin American Spanish as a first 
language I am told. In Spain, "Spanish" (Castillian) is widely used but there 
are a lot that speak Catalan. And so on.

I think you answer that well in your next paragraph - people have the fonts they 
use regularly on their machine. People aquire others according to need. Clients 
can help by offering to download fonts that are needed. Or gracefully recover, 
or just to say "this passage is in Ancient Babylonian, you don't have the 
fonts". The user may care, or they may not. Clients start off with a minimal set 
and build up capabilities for what they are interested in reading.

Good. Keep saying these things. Multilingual capability is essential. The more 
people that express opinions about it and keep it in the forefront, the better.

Well it would have beein in HTML 3.0 but the reference code won't support it
so it has been delayed. Expect it in HTML/3.1 It is needed for lots of things
including

* Navigation.
* Document status indication CONFIDENTIAL etc.
* Put logos there when a document is authenticated.

The document at CERN specifies language codes as ISO 3316 with optional ISO 639 
country codes to specify a national variant. An example is given of en_UK for 
British English. Does anyone have a list  of these codes? (or a pointer to one)

Do they cover enough? For example can you specify things like Patagonian Welsh 
(ha!). What about historical languages? The country may be called something 
different, or (in the general case) the area of use of a language or language 
variant may not mesh well with a specific modern country.

[note on reversing the order of letters deleted]

The suggestion does not work when the text has multiple lines. For this the
rules are quite complex but tractable. there is an RFC with an algorithm
for doing the wrapping. I think it is better to assume that particular encodings
will read in their natural direction and then let the computer do the
reordering.

In X11 if you typeset Hebrew you end up with a negative length string with the
characters displayed right to left. Note this is not reversing the ordering
because the notion of right and left do not apply to a byte stream, only before 
and afterwards. The technology is international, it is our mindset that is 
parochial.

I demonstrated a motif browser that had Greek and Latin characters on the

And if the Xt hierarchy gets in the way write it without Xt.

This was discussed in the work with the Language Tag for MIME
etc. I mentioned (draft-ietf-mailext-lang-tag-00.txt). This
was the result (and I quote):

    1.  The Language tag

    The language tag is composed of 2 parts: A language tag and a
    subtag.

    The syntax of this header is:

    Language-Header ::= 'Content-language:' Language [',' Language]...
    Language ::= ALPHA*8 [ '-' ALPHA*8 ]

    The namespace of language tags and subtags is administered by the
    IANA. The following registrations are predefined:

    In the language tag:

    -    All 2-letter codes are interpreted according to ISO 639.

    -    All 3-letter codes are reserved for the (hopefully)
         forthcoming revision to ISO 639

    -    The value "IANA" is reserved for IANA-defined
         subregistrations

    -    The value "X" is reserved for private use. Subtags of "X"
         will not be registered by the IANA.

    -    No other registration is allowed.

    In the sublanguage tag:

    -    All 2-letter codes are interpreted as ISO 3166 country codes,
         according to the rules laid down in ISO 639.

    -    Codes of 3 to 8 letters may be registered with the IANA by
         anyone who feels a need for it. IANA has the right to reject
         registrations that are felt to be misleading.

    The information in the sublanguage tag may for instance be:

    -    Country identification, such as en-US (this usage is
         described in ISO 639)

    -    Dialect information, such as no-NYNORSK or en-COCKNEY

    -    Languages not listed in ISO 639, which can be registered with
         the IANA prefix, such as IANA-CHEROKEE


    If multiple languages are used in the MIME body part, they are
    listed with commas between them.

And, later

    3.  Usage examples

    Examples of protocol usage of this header are:

    -    WWW selection of an appropriate version of information for
         display, based on a profile for the user listing languages
         that are understood

    -    MIME usage of alternate body parts in E-mail

So, *this* part of the work is already done, just to use.

Yes, a very tough nut to crack.  I'm glad to hear you say it, actually
-- I spent five years of my life working on this problem, I'm glad to
hear it isn't actually trivial! 

I suggest that you might want to read my CSCW 92 paper on the ATOMICMAIL
language.  This was a predecessor of Safe-Tcl, now defunct, but was
based on your beloved LISP syntax.  You might find some of the security
problems in a safe LISP variant were already addressed in that work. 

For my part, spending several years building a safe LISP variant was one
of the things that convinced me that Tcl was a far more appropriate
language model for this sort of thing.  -- Nathaniel

Fascinating.  It's worth bearing in mind that John only built Tk as an
example of the *class* of things that Tcl made easier.  Given that, in
the process, he produced what is arguably the world's best toolkit for
X11, it seems to me imprudent to dismiss out of hand John's own
interpretation of what he had done.  If you ask John, I'm sure he'll
tell you that it is the Tcl language and architecture that made Tk what
it is.  For my part, I believe him 100%.

I think you are mixing (1) and (2). I was referring to just (1)
here: the possibility to localize the client. In our research
and education environment we would like to offer our students
the Mosaic user-interface in Swedish and that Mosaic fetches in
the first place Swedish-language documents if such exist, else
English. In parallell to this, our non-Swedish guest
researchers must be able to use just English language. The i18n
methods could make the user-interface choice possible through
the use of "locale" settings, still having just one binary
program file. The default document language choice could also
be controlled by "locale", but if a language priority list is
desired, additional "preferences" settings is required.

First, I would like to thank Mr. Nebel for bringing up this topic.  A 
standard method of file upload simplifies the transition of the Web to a 
read/write system.  (Something I have needed in my own work.)

The proposed widget is interesting, but I am concerned because HTTP POST 
would become the only HTTP method that does not follow the simple "single 
request-single response" design of other HTTP transactions.  With the 
proposed widget, the server will have to wait for the CGI script to complete 
before it can complete the transaction, or impose an arbitrary time-out on 
the transaction (another server configuration parameter!).  The client, 
meanwhile, has to wait on the server's response before it can end the 
transaction at its end.  IMHO, the proposed method would not have the 
(current) HTTP nature.

The larger question is, "How often would multiple files need uploading?". 
 As a software developer and a Webmaster (both professions requiring working 
with groups of files), I find the common case is editing of one file. 
 Multi-file operations are handy at the start of a project or when porting 
code.  For the sake of logical partitioning, modifications should extend 
across as few files as reasonable without glomming everything together into 
one big file.

The widget I have proposed uses a single-line edit box, a button, and a 
simple file-selection dialog box.  The HTTP protocol would need no changes 
to handle this widget while still enjoying the benefits of receiving files 
on top of the current reception of form parameters.  There would need to be 
a separator between the CGI variables and the files; a CR-LF pair would do 
nicely.

Subject: ISO, Unicode; right-left languages
content-length: 5988

Several people have written, mostly my compatriots, suggesting that there
isn't much demand for multilingual text - still less bidirectional text.
I'd like to take this opportunity to show that the issue is in fact impor-
tant enough to have spawned several RFCs and a series of ECMA and ISO/IEC
technical reports and standards.  You can look at servers that are biling-
ual right now, although they won't look right unless you have a specially
hacked server (e.g. try http://www.huji.ac.il/WWW_DIR/default.html).  Read
on, brave souls:

First, I quote a previous response to my posting on bidirectional word-
wrap.  The poster is commenting on the option of using "visual" or
reverse encoding for right-left language:

>[note on reversing the order of letters deleted]
>
>The suggestion does not work when the text has multiple lines. For this the

This doesn't quite make sense to me.  Files have no order, other than
beginning-to-end.  The notion of right-left and left-right is purely
visual.  So ideally you'd always want to code all languages the same:
The characters that come first in the text come first in the file.  You
say this later on on your posting, so I realize you're fully aware of
the issues.

The reason we can't just do things this way is that bilingual diction-
aries, servers with bi- or multi-lingual menus (e.g. Japanese-English,
Arabic-English), etc., must cope with translating a mondirectional file
structure into a bidirectional display.  To do this you have to either
change directions manually in the file (example one in my last posting)
or you must use the same internal directionality, and rely on either the
server to preformat the display, or let the client do the reversal it-
self (example two in my last posting).

It's really not all that difficult to do once you're used to how the
system works.  There are well-established typographical conventions on
how to wrap mixed left-right and right-left text, and there are some
de facto standards on how to mix up-down with either of these.  Any-
one who is seriously interested in implementing such a scheme is in-
vited to contact me for more information.  I'm probably not the best
source though.  There are existing docs you can consult (read on...).

Although the market in Arabic-speaking countries is potentially huge,
most of the initial work has been done for Hebrew.  RFC 1555 has some
discussion of the difference between 1) coding direction shifts into the
byte stream and 2) leaving them for the server and client to arrange.
I quote from RFC 1555 (here it's talking about mail):

   The default directionality of the text is visual.  This means that
   the Hebrew text is encoded from left to right (even though Hebrew
   text is entered right to left) and is transmitted from left to right
   via the standard MIME mechanisms.  Other methods to control
   directionality are supported and are covered in the complementary RFC
   1556, "Handling of Bi-directional Texts in MIME".

Unfortunately, RFC 1556 doesn't help much:

   Fortunately, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) has
   tackled this problem previously and has issued a technical report
   called "Handling of Bi-Directional Texts".  ECMA TR/53, as it is
   called, was used to update the Standard ECMA-48 which in turn was
   used as the basis for ISO/IEC 6429 which was adopted under a special
   "fast track procedure". It is based on this information that a new
   character set is being defined which will indicate that the bi-
   directional message is either encoded in implicit mode or explicit
   mode.  The default is visual mode which requires no special character
   set other than the standard ones previously defined by ISO-8859.

I haven't consulted ECMA TR/53, and I'd like to know where it can be
had.  RFC 1556 doesn't actually get down to the details, but dwells
mainly on visual encoding - which, as has been pointed out here, will
not work well if you don't know where the line breaks occur.

My feeling is that there are plenty of resources out there to come to
at least a tentative solution to the problem of multidirectional text.
What we still need are:

    1) X widget sets that support multidirectional text (Motif apparently
       is on track to do this - put the pressure on, now!)
    2) HTML tags that tell us
        a) language
        b) encoding method (e.g. ISO 8859-1)
        c) which order the characters will be coming in, normal or
           reverse (note that this allows us to ignore whether the
           script goes visually l-r, r-l, or u-d)
        d) clients that recognize multilingual (possibly multidirec-
           tional) text, and can
            i) request necessary fonts from the server
            ii) fail gracefully if those fonts are not available, or
               if the client cannot cope with the display parameters
               (e.g. can't do Japanese; or, can't do Arabic in the mid-
               dle of an English text)
        e) servers that can provide fonts in a variety of formats on
           request; ultimately we'd need servers that could provide
           information about which characters are separators for which
           languages, although this could also be encoded as part of
           the overall DTD and client model (at great expense?)

To these ends, I'd like to float a proposal that there be a new entity
that enables us to code

    1) language (e.g. English, French, Dutch, Arabic, Japanese...)
    2) encoding (e.g. ISO 8859-1)
    3) direction (normal | reverse) - referring to the file; not the display

Again, if I (a Humanities guy) seem to be obtruding where I don't belong,
don't hesitate to put me in my place.

Subject: HTML and Custom Interfaces (was RE: Non-Scrolling Region)
content-length: 2714

I hate to sound like a purist, but requests like this are making HTML seem
less and less document-like.  Non-scrolling widgets, tool pallettes, forms,
and even my personal favorite, imagemaps are valid, important, and extremely
valuable things on the World Wide Web, but THEY AREN'T REALLY DOCUMENTS.

I've noticed that over the past couple years, the most controversial HTML
element proposals have almost always fallen into this category.  Consequently,
many are put off by HTML's weak interface (compared to Hypercard or multimedia
authoring tools), and weak document description (compared to any word
processor).  I believe this is because HTML is being asked to do everything, and
consequently can't do any of it very well.

So here goes my wild proposal.  Perhaps we should define a new language, ala
Tk, which is specifically designed for defining interfaces.  There is nothing
that locks HTTP with HTML; two major languages could be handled easily.  For
purposes of this argument, I'll call it WIDL (Web Interface Description
Language).  It could probably be largely lifted from Tk or other very-high-
level languages.  Basically it would be a very compact "program" that would
direct the browser to create new interface elements, carving up the HTML
document space, or open new windows.

This is not the same as sending scripts.  These interfaces wouldn't actually
"do" anything.  They would create widgets that would either execute standard
browser features (i.e. Back, Home, generate imagemap query, display HTML text)
or execute a URL with one of the defined methods.  Thus it would be very
closely tied to the Web, just like HTML is.

With this language, the following things could be shunted off HTML into WIDL:
  Forms
  Graphical Home Pages
  Interactive Graphics
  
Ralph's suggestion could be handled by a WIDL script that included elements
at the top, and a slightly smaller HTML-page widget.

An advantage of splitting these features off is that they would simplify the
document-description part of HTML, giving it room to add new features in the
field where it belongs without becoming completely unwieldy.

I know this sounds similar to the modular client idea, but the problem with
that approach is that you can never rely on everyone to have all the
necessary modules, and of course you can't send binary modules over HTTP, since
they are large and platform-specific.  Also, these could be interpreted well
by non-graphical clients (Lynx).

I hope this doesn't sound like one of those newbie "I want everything" requests,
but I think it can work.  I and my geography colleagues have a stack of
applications that are waiting for something like this.

There are several ideas relevant to this:

    o   Introducing a LANG attribute common to most elements for
        specifying the language is use in that context, e.g.
        <P LANG="en_uk">This is in British English, <EM LANG="fr">
        mais celui-ci c'est en francais</EM>

    o   Using the MIME header to declare which charset is in use
        e.g. Unicode.

    o   Using a mechanism like ISO 2022 to switch charsets dynamically
        as used by NTT's multilingual version of Mosaic.

    o   Introducing a CHARSET attribute to direct the browser that
        the next sequence of characters (following the ">") is in
        a specified character set

    o   Fixing SGML to handle multiple character sets properly

The LANG attribute is essential for handling text which reads right
to left rather than left to right. This can be mixed on the same line.
The character set issue needs to be resolved over the next few months.

I don't know about anyone else, but my httpd 1.3 doesn't send any of the

Subject: Content-Transfer-Encoding: packets for HTTP
Distribution: world


In developing enhancements to HTTP, which uses many MIME techniques,
we keep coming across the problem of "how do you signal the end of a
big block of binary data?"

The original method was to use the closing of the connection as
EOF. It's simple and it works for lots of applications.

A recent development is that many (certainly not all) HTTP servers add
a Content-Length: header in the resopnse. This allows the client user
interface to give the user an idea of how much longer the transmission
will take, but it's not reliable for any uses beyond that.

Besides: it's often the case that the HTTP server is receiving the
data from a source that doesn't allow it to determine the length of
the data before sending the data (a unix PIPE, for example.)

The idea of sending multiple objects in one HTTP transaction or
conducting multiple HTTP transactions over one TCP connection has
been raised again and again on the www-talk mailing list.

Most of the proposals involve using the MIME multipart/* syntax
and the boundary mechanism. This has terrible performance implications.
An HTTP server would have to scan the entire data stream to come up
with a suitable boundary before sending even the first body part.

Besides, the boundary mechanism is designed to address problems that
simply do not arise over a reliable 8-bit data stream.

However, one recent proposal struct me as a very good idea: The strategy
is to deploy a new content-transfer-encoding. Let's call it "packet."
The bytes of a body are written into a body part in packets: each
packet consists of a length (written out in ASCII characters, to avoid
byte order and word size issues), a CRLF, and a corresponding number
of bytes. For example, server code might look like:

write_response(FILE *body, const char *contentType)
{
	enum { LF=10, CR=13 };
	char buffer[4000]; /* chosen to match system considerations */
	int bytes;

	printf("0200 document follows%c%c", CR, LF);
	printf("Content-Type: %s%c%c", contentType, CR, LF);
	printf("Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet%c%c", CR, LF);
	printf("%c%c", CR, LF);

	while((bytes = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), body)) > 0){
		printf("%d%c%c", bytes, CR, LF);
		fwrite(buffer, 1, bytes, stdout);
	}

	/* @@ Hmmm... what happens if I get an error reading from body?
	 * perhaps negative packet lengths could be used to indicate
	 * errors?
	 */
	printf("0%c%c", CR, LF);
}


The returned data might look like:

	0200 document follows
	Content-Type: application/octet-stream
	Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet

	4000
	...4000 bytes of stuff...
	1745
	...1745 bytes of styff...
	0

Then the connection would be available for another transaction.

If several objects were to be wrapped up into one and returned using
this content-transfer-encoding, it wouldn't make sense to use a
multipart/* content type, unless it seems reasonable to use a name
like multipart/packet that does not share syntax with the oher
multipart types. I suggest aggregate/mixed, aggregate/parallel, etc.

There's still the issue of "how do you know when you've seen the last
body part of an aggregate/*?" How about this: when you're ready
to read the headers of the next body part, if you see instead a "."
on a line by itself, you're done.

The default content-transfer-encoding inside an aggregate/* is packet. So for
example:

	0200 document follows
	Content-Type: aggregate/mixed
	Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

	Content-Type: text/html

	4000
	...4000 bytes of stuff...
	1745
	...1745 bytes of styff...
	0
	Content-Type: image/gif

	4000
	...4000 bytes of stuff...
	1745
	...1745 bytes of styff...
	0
	.


Does this seem like a reasonable proposal?

Browsers *will* become fully SGMl aware, and they *will* support
stylesheets, I can guarantee that.There is nothing wrong with
specifying a UI interms of SGMl either, thoug it *is* a somewhat
strange application. Something like:

<window>
<hbox>
<texteditor width=400><menu><item NAME="item1" VALUE="foobar">
</hbox>
</window>

I should mention that the lisp based distributed hypermedia system I
wrote a few years ago also allowed editing of UI's, and in fact, the
original goal was to allow groups to work together to build a UI
suitable to presenting the information they were concerned with. This
went as far as editable text areas, video clips etc.

The above system had many nice features, but is *way* overkill for the
WWW. Perhaps having systems like this would be great, but perhaps they
should be built on top of a simpler foundations, or perhaps seperately,
but still be able to interact with the WWW in a meaningful, and open
manner. Eventually we'll all be moving to distributed object systems
anyway...

Hmm. This is what we saw in early versions of the system I mentioned.
Sometime the emergent behaviour of candy-grams with other candy-grams,
and themselves, even within a "safe" environment, is quite interesting
indeed! 

I should also mention that Elk is very good, but slow when compared to
some other schemes... the smallest of course, is probably siod: 45k or
so., and imbeddable.

It's easy enough to load safe-tcl documents to be viewed/execd by
an external viewer. If it becomes popular, then browsers will be
built with this feature built in.

Something I would like to see is a method for external viewers
to communicate back to the browser. People talk about this from
time to time but I've yet to see anything substantive (perhaps
I missed it).

It could be done any number of ways, we just need to pick something
that works well and use it.

It is nice to let both the client and the server reprogram each other.

Ummm... the server *still* won't be running Tk.  Who is going to look at it?
Tk is an X-Windows toolkit, you know.

Harinder,

> I am looking for a masters project on caching mechanisms 
> for NCSA Mosaic to reduce network traffic and network latency.

One idea I would like to see explored is to make a start at handling
URNs. The basic idea goes like this:

    a)  Each object registered with the "network" is described by
        a file containing meta-information for the object, e.g.
        the author, expiry date, copyright holder, title, keywords
        from a controlled vocabulary etc. The registration process
        generates a globally unique name (a URN). Mosaic's Fill-out
        forms seem like a natural interface for registration.

    b)  Web servers cooperate to provide a distributed name look up
        scheme similar in spirit to DNS, *BUT* which allows for
        distributed copies of objects as well as naming info. The
        caching hierarchy is modelled after DNS, following the
        IP network/subnetwork divisions.

This approach saves time by combining the process of resolving a URN
to a physical address and retrieving the object. Given that you are
after a masters degree, I think you should aim to keep things real
simple. The idea introduces server to server communication and could
be built by adapting existing server software. Don't worry too much
about the syntax for URNs; I would recommend something like:

 gun: name [.name]*   e.g. gun:mybook.me.mydepartment.myuniversity.edu

I have used gun for "globally unique name" :) to avoid confusion with
the ongoing IETF efforts to come up with a consensus for URNs. This
choice would fit the globally unique names into the URL name space.

Let me know if you want more detailed info on how this all would work.
I have lots more ideas, e.g. for rule based binding of URNs to objects
based on properties of the client, aliases, non-hierarchical naming
schemes using centroids, and pre-emptive caching.

You may have noticed that some subscribers have difficulties to
unsubscribe.

Usually, they have registered under one specific email, 
and then try to unsubscribe from another account.

Of course, the listprocessor cannot find their entry
in the database, nor does it allow a removal of
another entry that they may specify, since
it cannot authentify them.

Some of you have proven they knew ways to pass this
difficulty, and I thank them for having done so when
this list was receiving garbage :)

I will soon modify the capabilities of this list processor
so that subscribers may subscribe or unsubscribe under whatever
email. Subscribers will be allowed to protect themselves by 
modifying their password. If you have other suggestions,
please let me know.

Please do not mail to this list for such administrative
requests. I know I may act with some delay, and I will
do my best to fasten this.

Arthur

Subject: Re: ISO, Unicode; right-left languages

To save time I agree with all of what Richard said except for his final bit :-

    1) language (e.g. English, French, Dutch, Arabic, Japanese...)
    2) encoding (e.g. ISO 8859-1)
    3) direction (normal | reverse) - referring to the file; not the display

First off I don't see anything `normal' about left/right. The ordering is
temporal, not spacial as Richard points out.

What I do not want is to have to cope with two orderings where one is enough.
If there is a need to reorder bytes for the purposes of the display I
would much prefer to do it myself after I have rendered the entities etc
into tokens. Having the user do it as well simply confuses matters.

The one exception I would make is for apperances of out of band entities in
normal text. IE if I have a bit of text "fred &aleph;&gimel;" and the entities
are just pushed into standard text I want them to be read left-right since
they are in a LATIN context. To make them read right-left I would have to
put them in a HEBREW context. 

This is to make the maths mode work since there may be the odd equation with
hebrew characters (eg HEP equations).


Anyway I have just been digging for fonts and come up with a lot of mf ones.
Does anyone know how to make them into X11 bitmaps in an easy manner. I would
like to have the hieroglyphic font in X11. More importantly I would like the 
TeX maths fonts in X11 and ps. i'm not sure about the best way to do this.

Anyone know the ISO enties for hieroglphs? &hierA1; &hierA2; etc?

Try putting a reflector in your CGI and see what happens.
Whose httpd are you using?  Seems to me that what the client sees
is a functions of how the CGI script was written.  I've had data
coming into the client before it had stopped sending to the server.
We have a process running on a PC (in Excel) that sends to the server
for POSTing to an Oracle database.  We can't get a Content length
without writing the output to a temporary buffer and that would be
a waste.  If the httpd handled multipart documents then it could
pick up the end tag but it doesn't (we're using the NCSA httpd).
Our temporary solution is to pipe the data through a shell script
looking for the end tag.

Could we discuss this at WWW 94?

The BOF section of WWW 94 might be a fine time to discuss this.
I added a proposal to the list (http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/bof.shtml)

My proposed BOF (http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/bof/20.shtml) reads
as follows:

-------------

HTML documents currently provide a limited amount of user interaction
though the forms and ISMAP interface, and a number of people have used
these to good effect. Now we also feel the limits of this interface.

It would be fun to talk about this. Topics might include: 

  * Establishing the requirements: what applications are simply not
    possible now but could be? 

  * Are there simple extensions to HTML that could enable such
    applications, or is this a bottomless pit? 

  * What are the issues for such interaction languages? (safety,
    expressibility,  multi-platform, multiple look-and-feel) 

  * Are there suitable existing languages? Among those suggested are Python,
    Scheme+Tk, and safe-tcl. 

For more information see http://dri.cornell.edu/pub/davis/html-interaction.html

From: Stavros Macrakis <macrakis@osf.org>

Dave Raggett says:

   The LANG attribute is essential for handling text which reads right
   to left rather than left to right....

Actually, all that is needed is a unique identification of each
presentation character as right-to-left or left-to-right.  If a viewer
encounters the logical sequence of letters Arabic-J Arabic-M Arabic-L,
is presenting them using Arabic script, and has an Arabic font to
present it in, it should display the glyphs:

	Final-Arabic-L  Median-Arabic-M  Initial-Arabic-J

Note that this requires two kinds of information: first, that Arabic
uses distinct glyphs for letters depending on adjacent letters, and
secondly, that Arabic script is written right-to-left.

If however the viewer cannot display Arabic script, or if the user
prefers Latin script (perhaps s/he doesn't even read Arabic script,
but is consulting the etymology of a word that comes from Arabic in a
dictionary), it may well choose to present it in transliteration as
"jml" in that order.  You can see from this example that it doesn't
matter what the _language_ is, it doesn't even matter what the
_letters_ are; what matters is the presentation _script_ used to
represent the letters.  Of course, it is critical that Arabic-J be
encoded differently from Latin-J.

The algorithm for displaying mixed left-to-right and right-to-left
glyphs is pretty straightforward and is presented in the Unicode
documents.  There is NO EXCUSE for using presentation order in HTML
documents.

	-s

PS This is not to say that a language attribute is a bad idea, but it
   is orthogonal to the script issue.

PPS Presenting Arabic nicely actually involves more than just Initial,
   Medial, and Final forms, but that is peripheral to the issues being
   discussed here.

I'd be interested in hearing.

Actually I'm hardly "beloved" of lisp like languages.  It took about
three years of discussion to get me out of the postscript/forth camp
:-)  (And I do all of my serious coding in C++, where the rich set of
class libraries gives me a better prototying environment than I get in
most interpretive languages.)

One of reasons I do like lisp/scheme is the garbage collection -- it makes
writing long-lived scripts much easier because memory leaks become much less
of a problem.

I don't think many client/viewers are going to be amenable to having random
long-lived scripts loaded into them as a result of a URL fetch.  I'm much
more concerned with what happens on servers.

I certainly would be interested if you have a short note describing
what it means to be a "safe" execution environment.  I saw the note
from Osterholz (sp) from Sun about safe-TCL mentioning database
updates and I was wondering how things like that could be secured.

"arguably" is certainly an appropriate word.  :-)

(I suspect that if one asked Gutenberg what was the most important
thing he had done, he would say "a beautiful bible" and that he
considered moveable type as a mere a tool to get it done faster.)

But let's get away from the language wars.

People have begun to talk about mechanisms in which documents may
contain embedded intelligence so that they are more than simple forms.
Functionality is a big issue.  Doing it safely is a big issue.  Choice
of language is a small issue.

If those documents are to have access to resources outside of those
they carry along inside of themselves, i.e. if they update shared
databases or interact with third party machines, the use of security
gets even more interesting; and I think that it then goes well beyond
the concept of a neutered "safe" execution environment.

Then there is the nearly 100% severable issue of clients putting
things into a server.  My favorite example is a periodic polling
script that would let me know when a new document of a certain type
appears in the server.  This is perhaps a robot issue, but it is
something I think many commercial users would want.  (Or, as a
scientist, I might want a poll script to watch for new documents which
pertain to a certain process or which cite some previous document.)

It is this latter possibility that intrigues me.  I don't know that it
fits very well with the current architecture.

I don't see why you don't think HTML forms are a reasonable place to
start in designing WIDL: they're device independent, include the
semantics of what is being asked for rather than the widgets for
presentation, have a possibility of reflecting themselves in
interfaces that are used with pens or voice activiation rather than
typing and clicking. I do think that the forms capability in HTML
needs some more focused attention, and that most of the HTML designers
are currently looking at more traditional document representation
issues (ICADD, SGML, tables). I think there's as much a place for
"semantic markup" for user interfaces (vs, say, what you get from TK)
as there is for semantic markup for text independent of what you get
from PDF.

What's missing from HTML forms? Beyond the ability to ask for files
and other kinds of data stream (which is a BOF/working group which
we're pursuing with some vigor), the ability to selectively enable or
disable interface choices, are there other features present in
interface construction toolkits that aren't here?

The ATOMICMAIL CSCW paper is available in pub/nsb/CSCW-ATOMICMAIL.txt on
thumper.bellcore.com.  36 kbytes.  Bear in mind that ATOMICMAIL is now
100% obsolete, though. 

As for persistence and garbage collection -- Tcl is GREAT at this sort
of thing.  You have access to several storage management schemes.  Also,
Tcl's facility for allowing multiple "interpreters" gives you the
ULTIMATE garbage collection -- you can reclaim EVERYTHING if you so
choose as soon as the foreign script is done running, by running it in
its own interpreter.  Hybrid schemes are also possible. 

As for what it means to have a safe execution environment, I refer you
both to the ATOMICMAIL paper and to the Safe-Tcl paper published in
ULPAA '94 of this year.  That paper is available as part of the safe-tcl
distribution, which also includes a document that explains the basic
model, a language specification, full source code and documentation. 
FTP it from ftp.ics.uci.edu, in the directory mrose/safe-tcl.  

There's also a mailing list:  safe-tcl[-request]@cs.utk.edu, for anyone
who is interested. 

I am NOT going to argue that Tcl is the perfect language, or that I have
solved all the problems of safe execution environments and everyone
should just use my work.  However, I do strongly encourage you to read
about Safe-Tcl and to try to avoid re-inventing the wheel if possible. 
A single scripting language, with both restricted ("safe") and
unrestricted versions, would be a great thing to see universally
deployed.....  -- Nathaniel

I think you'll find this addressed at least partially by ATOMICMAIL's
file system, Safe--Tcl's distributed libraries, and the Safe-Tcl
two-interpreter extension model.  Check it out.

I'm not sure, because I don't understand this example.  When the new
document comes to exist, what exactly do you want to happen?  -- NB

"Normal" - let me clarify - would mean simply this:  That the order in
which you read the text is the order it occurs in the file.  This has
nothing to do with the way the text is displayed.  I felt it was impor-
tant to separate these two issues out.  "Reverse" would be allowed, but
depracated, because it only works if you put in hard carriage returns,
and know what the line lengths are going to be.  You'd need to block off
each line separately, putting in <BR> and turning off </arabic>.  It is
a horrible mess, and I would not complain a bit if everyone just said,
"To hell with it; we'll just make sure clients know what to do when a
shift from left-right to right-left occurs, or can barf appropriately
if they don't."

I agree.  But in fact both ways of doing things seem to exist.  Note the
RFCs I quoted in my last posting (1555 & 1556).  The default MIME standard
is, in fact, the "backwards" way of doing things that you and I are com-
plaining about.

This is where the current model breaks down since it is essentially
driven by client requests.  I'd like to be able for my viewer to put a
"watcher" into a server.  Some mechanism, not yet existing, would have
to be invented to let the watcher tell my viewer that something new
and interesting (as defined by my script) is out there.  Then my
viewer could have the new document fetched, my coffee brewed, and my
slippers handy when I got up in the morning.

This isn't a wild idea.  I get this kind of service from a lot of the
information publishers.  For example, Shepards will FAX me updates
as they occur.  Yes, I pay extra, but it is a valuable service.

Using the Shepards model -- suppose I'm researching a-b-hydrolithium
as a cure for aging.  I'd want to put a script into the servers for a
number of of journals to inform me of any document that is added that
refers to a-b-hydrolithium or any document that had a citation to Dr.
Foo's groundbreaking paper on the use of lithium "A" compounds.

What do you mean by "my viewer"?  If, for example, you're willing to be
notified by email, the watcher can simply send you an active email (e.g.

I like this proposal.  It requires finite buffers (4000 bytes) which
will improved performance of piped applications, and it supports multiparts.  

Just a question, can the receiver of http assume a reliable transport
mechanism, without errors, or should there be some kind of CRC or
similar confidence check on the length headers to assure that the 
receiver doesn't get misaligned? 

...well two questions...   Are you proposing a standardized maximumum size 
on the packets, or could this be negotiated in an Accept header?
(4K sounds like a reasonable fixed max to me .... anything but 53bytes ;-)

I have to agree with Dave here, though you are persuasive enough,
I'll admit.  The basic point is that various coding schemes overlap.
You can't assume that everyone will jump on the Unicode bandwagon
right away.  In come contexts, 8-bit characters will always be with
us.  So we are left with only one option - a LANG attribute, plus
some other attribute designating the encoding scheme used.

Just in theoretical terms, it's more pleasing to talk about languages
then characters, anyway.  After all, I can write a glyph any way I
want.  What determines how the glyph relates to other glyphs is the
script system it belongs to.

This is a really thoughtful point, and frankly it had not occurred
to me before.  There are, indeed, international standards for trans-
literating Arabic, as for many other languages.  Your idea, though,
is not practical because there aren't always one-to-one correspon-
dences.  Take, for example, the classical Hebrew shwa.  How do we
do it in English?  First of all it is a diacritic.  Secondly it is
pronounced differently in different contexts - sometimes as nothing
at all.  It's a bit like rendering English "wine" in a foreign
script.  Do we transliterate the final -e?

Unfortunately, transliteration requires more than a simple mapping
of one charset to another.  Knowledge of the underlying language is
required.  So I vote that we stick with a LANG attribute.  If a
client runs into Arabic, and can't display Arabic, then it's out of
luck.  I don't think that automatic translation into a Latin font
is practical for enough cases to warrant building it into the cli-
ents along with everything else we're proposing.

Here here!

I'm really amazed at how much people here know about so many dif-
ferent things.

"Viewer" == Mosaic++, ...etc

I want to get a response that is in such a form that an integrated
intelligent viewer can give a homogeneous interface to the user.

I would expect that using e-mail would be difficult to smoothly
integrate and probably a pain to administer.  Rather, I would want a
more unified and consistent exhange mechanism, so that, for example,
only one TCP connection need be used.

I'm rather opposed to building world-wide mechanisms using the
duct-tape-and-bailing wire mechanisms found in e-mail, particularly
Un*x based e-mail.

(Of course, who am I to complain, considering I've been promoting IP
over e-mail [and punched paper tape] for years.)

Don't really see why it would need to be active; a standard MIME
message/external-body with a pointer to the information (probably
along with a textual explanation and whatever else seems appropriate)
should suffice nicely.

A structured mail message certainly should be able to do that...

This seems like a rather low level of problem to be worrying about;
what matters is that the server can somehow send a message to the user
which will cause the user's client to be directed to the new
information.  Considering the server (presumably) has no way of
knowing where the user is, or whether he's running a client at all at
the moment, email seems very well suited to this task.

I've been reading www-talk for about a year, read lots of archives, poured
over the docs at CERN and NCSA, and I still think that giving presentational
hints wouldn't violate the fundamentals of what TimBL and others had in 
mind.  And I'm not interested in verging away from SGML for this, 
either.  This doesn't have to be irresistable force (artistic 
presentation) versus immovable object (structured, efficient text).  HTML 
won't give everything to both camps, but it can go pretty far.  I'll be 
posting a wish list here soon of things I'd like to see which haven't 
been addressed by anything I've seen presented on HTML 3.0, all of which 
can be hopefully done in SGML.

Well, exactly what I was saying, too, which is that the two of them

Hmm... I don't agree.  The Web's primary value is indeed in a standard user
interface, and browser plug-ins would indeed by default change that user
interface.  If designed well, they would change them in a uniform way - or
leave that change up to the browser to best implement, the same way HTML is
left up to the browser.  Content providers might have need for different
options or capabilities to be built into the browser specifically for their
system, obviating the need for separate "Mosaic customized for l10n", "Mosaic
with fish search", "Mosaic supporting mailto: URLs".  That's all I'm 
talking about here.  Some people might even sell plug-ins that talk a 
proprietary protocol to their server for something - a modular browser is 
really the only way that business model could float.

On the subject of plug-ins - any word from NCSA (or spyglass) as to the 
status of XMosaic 2.5 and the forthcoming plug-in scheme?

Ack!  Maybe I just don't have my thinking cap set on correctly, but what
application would involve public, anonymous users sending code to the server
to run, who wouldn't otherwise have a login account on that system or are
"trusted" anyways?

Wait - here's a new tack on the client-side safe scripting languages problem. 
There is a certain set of actions that are "unsafe", and so far the debate
has been over what can be done to get a safe language for the WWW.  Instead,
why not create a safe-environment-shell, in which a script in *any* language
that the client can understand can run, and when it attempts to do something
labeled as unsafe, the user is prompted for validation (or gives his consent
on certain actions by default).  I doesn't seem like it would be too 
difficult to create this shell, though I don't know what the performance 
hit would be like.  For example, I could put up a Perl script to do the 
Xerox map generator, the mime type of which would be

application/perl

and that type is mapped to 

application/perl; safecsh perl

I guess this is similar in a way to Vinay's vsafecsh, at

http://www.eit.com/software/vsafecsh/vsafecsh.html

though a bit more extensive in that you don't declare the safe programs, 
you declare the safe system operations.  Also nice would be added 
security like zero-ing out any memory the application might want to 
allocate.  This solution is indeed platform-specific, but it's only 
platform-specific at the client level - many scripting languages have 
been ported to every major platform.  And for the non-faint-of-heart,
compiled languages could work similarly - downloading a C program, having 
it compiled, and starting it all with one click of a button would be just 
too cool.

Now, this *still* doesn't solve the question of creating dynamic user
graphical interfaces, I admit - but that's a whole different can of worms.
What I'd like to see is a list of applications that require their own user
interface that *can't* be done using either client-side plug-ins or giving
more oomph to HTML (there's lots that can be done with the LINK element, hint
hint).  My guess is that the list is small, and the applications so intensive
- 3-d object viewer comes to mind - that expecting a scripting gui 
language to do that would be asking... a lot.

I've already done a simple version of this using a CGI script for an
electronic journal prototype I ran (Project ELVYN; a BLR&DD funded project
in cooperation with the IoPP).  Basically there was a form that the user
could fill in with keywords and his email address.  These were the salted
away in a file.  When a new issue of the journal was processed to put it
online, a script was run over the email address/keyword file and each line
was used to search the new issue of the journal for keyword matches.  If
there were any matches the document titles and URLs were extracted and
emailed to the user.  I called it the alerting service.

Looking at the logs, I must say that I'm surprised to find that it wasn't
very popular.  Maybe the users just didn't understand what it was for. 
Anyway, the point of all this is that if we had a scripting language that
allowed late-binding code and data to be uploaded to the server, this type
of service would be much more powerful.  On the other hand, it would also
require programming skills from the users and whilst this is fine for most
of the members of this mailing list, the great unwashed masses might not
be so keen on it.

This is an interesting answer if you think that 'client-editing' is
the most common case of a client uploading a file to a server.
However, the kinds of applications that have been proposed are:

   NSF puts up web servers for grant applications.
   You fill out the form, and, as part of it, submit the
    postscript of your application, the individual resumes
    of all of the participants, and the budget.

   
   SGML validation service: you supply the DTD as one file,
    and the SGML file as another.

   etc. etc.

I'll be the first to admit that lots of applications need only a
single file upload, but lots more might want several files. In either
case, no changes to 'HTTP' are being proposed. Changes to HTML,
additional MIME types to encapsulate multiple values more efficiently,
etc. 

Submitting things by ftp: or mailto: make perfect sense, too.

Funny you should mention that, but I am just in the process of experimenting
with this for the HTML 3.0 proposal.

In HTML+ I extended the LINK element and defined a fixed set of REL
attribute values for this purpose. Using LINK in this way to define
navigation buttons (or menu items) makes it particularly easy to add
hypertext paths or guided tours where a separate list of URLs is used
to insert Previous and Next buttons into the toolbar. In fact the HTTP
protocol even defines a mechanism for using WWW-Link: fields in the
MIME header that are merged into the document head. This gives us a
way of defining toolbars for other document types than HTML.

The basic requirements are:

    o   Defining a set of buttons or menu items that can be viewed
        on graphical and non-graphical browsers, preferably with
        the ability to provide a custom graphic

    o   Providing a way for automatically inserting Previous
        and Next buttons when following a guided tour

    o   Static text such as "Company Confidential"

    o   Static images such as corporate logos

In my opinion the position of the non-scrolling area should be a matter
of personal preference, e.g. whether you prefer it to be at the top,
left or right sides, or the bottom of the scrolling area. The security
status of a document *shouldn't* be part of either area to avoid the
worry that authors might work a way of fooling the user with a suitably
chosen graphic. SecureMosaic uses a new region placed next to the globe
device.

Anyway, I hope to get something working, but am running out of time
for WWWF'94. The email load is getting in the way of programming :(

Perhaps I am not on the right mailing-lists, but there seemed to be a
flurry of ideas, if not actual activity, surrounding this just before
WWW'94 and then everything quietened down.

Is the Web now too large for such a radical new idea?

David,

I think you "jumped the gun" so to speak with your admonition. Club
Internet is 100% based on the World-Wide Web! :-) It is constructed
from a distributed set of Web servers many of which are provided by
sponsoring companies and linked into the club. Our "commercial
solicitation", as you call it, was merely a pre-announcement to seek
those wishing to contribute to the club.

The reason our Web URL has not been announced is because it does not
open for access until 1995 and thus is not yet available to be accessed.
The club will have a large area with free access and a subscriber only
area.

I hope this clears up both yours and everyone else's misconception about
our announcement -- we have been inundated! 

Our apologies for any confusion or disappointment that the URL is not
yet public -- watch the newspapers for that snippet -- not this space!

Nigel Willson.

  NGS> Is the Web now too large for such a radical new idea?

I don't think that the Web is too large to do a considerable amount of work
in getting URNs functional.  Although achieving a ubiquitous implementation
might take a while (and probably should, considering the number of issues
still needing to be resolved), there's no reason that individual service
providers couldn't at least have URNs for their own site, providing at least
a partial fix for the "roaming URL" problem.

The work to be done to in getting "site-wide URNs" (ahem) isn't really all
that bad.  I know that at least I (and a few others) have made a couple of
baby steps in that direction utilizing HTTP redirection (that is to say, one
attempts to retrieve <URL:http://www.hmc.edu/urn/opaque_urn_syntax>, the
server figures out where to map this to, and issues a redirect to the
client).  I'm using the Plexus server, so it's been almost trivial to
implement this at a low level, but it should be doable via CGI programs for
any server.

I personally think that most of the prototyping for URNs for the Web should
be implemented in terms of HTTP redirects instead of spending much effort
modifying the vast installed browser base to do URNs natively.  Although
implementing this server-side resolution would kill any large-volume server,
those of us with smaller severs actually have a fair amount of spare CPU
cycles to kill with this kind of experimentation.

Are there any other people who have set up "site-wide URNs"?  All's we
really need is two cooperating sites doing server-side URN resolution to get
a large amount of real-world experience in the resolution protocol and the
issues involved.  Although I have my own grandiose visions for the
resolution protocol, I imagine that whois++ will be the only protocol we can
standardize upon quickly.

Is anyone working on a perl-based whois++ implementation?

How about I want to query the New York Times database and get back a list of
all their URLs that have the mention of a guitar in them?

What if I want to search the picture database as well?  *I* know how to find
guitars in pictures, but it's not the sort of thing you build into a search
engine.

And hey, why not call that shell "Safe Tcl"?   ;-)

Seriously, if I'm running under ms-dos and you send me a C program, how do I
keep it from messing things up? I mean, I would have thought the finger
protocol was pretty easy to get right, you know?  The morris worm I think
pretty plainly shows that you can introduce loopholes in even the simplest
things if you're sloppy.  It's clear to me that what you want is a specific
list of things allowed rather than a list of things disallowed.

And even if awk, perl, tcl, glump, floop and splurg have all been ported to
DOS, I might not want them all installed on the off chance that someone out
there might want to use one for something.  That's half the impetus that
keeps C alive (flames to email, please).

Suppose I want to provide access to a fortran to C

a number of files.

A remote compiler is another example.

This issue of client-side scripting is something I tackled quite a while
back now. For HTML the approach is simple, you add a SCRIPT attribute to
the FORM element that specifies the URL of a script. The browser then
uses the Accept header to specify which scripting languages it supports.

What we should be spending air time on is the abstract API between
the browser and the script interpreter. Trusted scripts can be recognised
as such as they will carry a digital signature plus certificates in the
HTTP header. I will therefore concentrate on untrusted scripts:

    o   scripts can read a set of browser environment variables
        e.g. the user's name, email address, time of day etc.

    o   scripts can read the contents of form fields and their
        associated status flags (in-error, disabled).

    o   scripts can set the contents of form fields and their
        associated status flags (in-error, disabled).

    o   scripts can get/set the current focus

    o   scripts are passed various classes of events, e.g.
        get/release focus, mouse clicks, keyboard events

    o   scripts can set/clear a system error message

    o   scripts can access a few well chosen library routines

    o   scripts are limited in the amount of memory or screen
        resources they can consume

    o   scripts interpreters are linked to the browser via
        a (scripting) language independent API

    o   form fields belong to a well defined set of classes
        but there is a way to define new classes that are
        painted by the script

    o   scripts can't send messages

I don't have time to refine this, and would love to see other people
work together on refining this into a detailed proposal, rather than
arguing on which language to choose.

p.s. why not Visual Basic :)

But this implies, for example, that your Mosaic-like browser is always
running, doesn't it?  It seems to me that if you want the remote agent
to be able to notify you whenever it finds something, regardless of what
you are doing, you need an asynchronous protocol for personal
communication, which to my mind means some variant of email....

	I've never been fond of  LISTSERV/listproc/listprocessor 
use of passwords.   The usual reasons apply.   I'd avoid it. 
 
	One thing that may give you and us the needed relief is 
domain string matching.   What I mean is,  this note should appear 
to come to you from   "troth@rice.edu",  but it's being composed on 
the machine  "is.rice.edu"  and would  (with a different MUA)  appear 
to be from  "troth@is.rice.edu".   So what I'm saying is that you 
could/should match right-to-left for the length of the shorter of 
the two FQDNs,  if an exact match fails.

   I have to agree with Dave here, though you are persuasive enough,
   I'll admit.

"Persuasive", perhaps, but apparently not "enough"....

   The basic point is that various coding schemes overlap.  You can't
   assume that everyone will jump on the Unicode bandwagon right away.
   In come contexts, 8-bit characters will always be with us.  So we
   are left with only one option - a LANG attribute, plus some other
   attribute designating the encoding scheme used.

I was not assuming that everyone will be using Unicode immediately.  I
was assuming that any character in the HTML can be unambiguously
identified.  This only needs an encoding-system attribute, not a
language attribute.  The rendering system does _not_ need to know
whether a given letter "t" in my text is being used to write German,
Chinese in Pinyin, or Maltese.  It does not need to know whether a
given letter Arabic-sin is being used to write Arabic, Persian,
Ottoman Turkish, or Greek (yes, I have seen Greek written in Arabic
script), or whether a given letter Hebrew-aleph is being used to write
Hebrew or Yiddish.

   Just in theoretical terms, it's more pleasing to talk about
   languages then characters, anyway.  After all, I can write a glyph
   any way I want.  What determines how the glyph relates to other
   glyphs is the script system it belongs to.

Part of the problem here is terminological.  Unfortunately, there is
no standard terminology.  In any case, I think we agree that the
_script system_ of each character needs to be unambiguously
identified--we would not want to encode an Arabic-L in the same way as
a Latin-L.

   >If however the viewer cannot display Arabic script, or if the user
   >prefers Latin script (perhaps s/he doesn't even read Arabic script,
   >but is consulting the etymology of a word that comes from Arabic in a

   >"jml" in that order.

   This is a really thoughtful point, and frankly it had not occurred
   to me before.  There are, indeed, international standards for
   trans- literating Arabic, as for many other languages.  Your idea,
   though, is not practical because there aren't always one-to-one
   correspon- dences.  Take, for example, the classical Hebrew shwa.
   How do we do it in English?  First of all it is a diacritic.
   Secondly it is pronounced differently in different contexts -
   sometimes as nothing at all.  It's a bit like rendering English
   "wine" in a foreign script.  Do we transliterate the final -e?
   Unfortunately, transliteration requires more than a simple mapping
   of one charset to another.  Knowledge of the underlying language is
   required.  So I vote that we stick with a LANG attribute.

Note that I said "transliterate" and not "transcribe".  We certainly
don't have enough information from the Arabic text j-m-l to know
whether to transcribe it as jamal or jumil or whatever.  However, we
do have the information to transliterate it as jml.  I agree that we
can do a better job of transliterating if the language is identified,
since in some cases different transliteration systems are used for
different languages using the same script.  But this is a second-order
effect.  As I said in my last message, identifying the language _is_
useful, but not essential, as is identifying the script system.

   If a client runs into Arabic, and can't display Arabic, then it's
   out of luck.  I don't think that automatic translation into a Latin
   font is practical for enough cases to warrant building it into the
   clients along with everything else we're proposing.

This is up to the client writers to decide.  The HTML spec should
simply provide the necessary information.  Let me give you an example
of the usefulness of the functionality I sketched.  The 11th edition
of the Encyclopedia Britannica (which has a good chance of being
online soon, for free) includes citations in Greek and Hebrew in the
original script.  I am familiar with Greek script, and would like to
see it as Greek.  However, I am not familiar with Hebrew script, and
would prefer to see it in transliteration.  The OED includes even more
scripts in the original form....

Subject: Mosaic '94: Accessibilty IS an ISSUE
content-length: 2175

I have received the following mail from TV Raman, a blind Web user and creater
of AsTeR. Please note that Dr. Raman is an expert in this field and will be
attending Mosaic '94. He and I are very interested in pursuing the issues
related to access to the WEB, MOSAIC, and people with disabilties.

Thus far, I have received a few brief replies from folks at the NCSA. I 
really appreciate this. However, we are looking for committment and 
communication from you. 

At the moment, I am not funded (nor financially in a position) to attend
Mosaic '94. I am working on this. One way or another, I plan to get there.

Please feel free to contact me so that we can organize a meeting in Chicago.

Hi Mike,

I just sent the following to the html-wg list (html working group).
Could you also forward the note to the icadd list?

There seems to be considerable interest at the Mosaic94 conference in making
the WWW accessible to the print-impaired.

Most of the emphasis is being placed on the WWW browsers. Though it is
important to have accessible browsers, they're useless if the information
present on the WWW is not encoded in an accessible format.

Given that there has been some interest on this list on the issues of making
HTML and ICAD converge, as well as making HTML friendlier to applications
producing output in alternative formats, could we pull together a meeting at
the Mosaic conference to address these questions?

Main thrust:

An accessible WWW requires accessible document encodings.
We may design the world's best accessible WWW browser, say one that produces
speech or Braille, but it'd be absolutely useless if the documents on the WWW
were gif, ps or pdf files!

It would be *very* difficult, actually.  There have been lots of
attempts to do this sort of thing.  It's really hard to come up with a
reliable list of safe or unsafe actions, and even harder to come up with
a hole-free implementation.  This sounds easy conceptually, but in
practice it is fraught with peril and complications......  It is
sufficiently hard to even build a safe language that building a safe
shell-like environment may be pretty near impossible in practice.  --

The is where all of the commercial work on "agents" is going - 
the client sending code to the server. This is largely because
they are targeting the disconnected mobile user and the 
low-bandwith connected home user. This is exactly what Telescript,
etc. is supposed to do. ( With a lot of commercial hooks most of
us university internet folks haven't addressed much yet: how to
specify "and I don't want to spend more than $NN on this search,
and here's the billing authority. You may pass this charge token
on to other servers as long as all requests do not exceed $NN. ) 


I DON'T know if they have looked at the problem in the other
direction at all - the server sending code to the client. But
for mobile users, with small memory machines and no simple way
of adding yet another viewer when required, it would seem to 
make sense for them to allow this also. "Oh - you don't know
how to handle gsm compressed audio ? well, here's the code to
decompress it... " - i.e. the PostScript model - don't send
the bitmap, send the instructions to create it.

I would not want to enforce a uniform transliteration system based
on encoding scheme only.  You have to reckon with the possibility
that you will use one encoding scheme, but different translitera-
tion systems, depending on the language each encoding scheme is
used to render.  I certainly would not want to render Persian with
the same system used for classical Arabic, though they are written
with the same basic glyphs.

Let's take an interesting example from the remote past.  The basic
Sumerian syllabary (our oldest writing system) was used to repre-
sent Akkadian, Hittite, Urartian, Elamite, and so on.  Slight dif-
ferences in sign shapes accumulate over time and across various
locales, but the system is basically the same.  Probably the most
practical initial design of a coding scheme for this script would
be to start with a single encoding. but have a language attribute that
would allow us to make adjustments for time and place, and signal
different transliteration schemes if need be.

Having language and encoding scheme separate just buys us a little flexi-
bility.

How about.... email?

Why not send an email to the client's account.  When the email arrives, it
starts up a viewer on the selected information.

The thing you have to ask yourself is what happens if 1) you're not logged
in, 2) you're not running a viewer, 3) your machine is turned off, .... when
this new document arrives.

Why not just extend your email viewer to handle external references that can
include URLs in addition to anon-ftp and all that stuff?

Just before the "language wars" broke out, I was thinking of this
problem, and Karl's remarks reminded me of it again.

What we want is a sort of asynchronous callback mechanism. 
E-mail is one sort, but it is *too* unboundedly asynchronous
for some requirements. 

I see two non-exclusive methods to do this: 

1: Client passes to the server, along with the request, a URL (containing,
probably, an explicit port number), and perhaps an authorization cookie,
and any advice or restrictions of when to call back. This URL could 
represent the client itself if it has the ability to also listen on
a port, as well as initiating connections. ( it becomes in effect, a 
mini, detached (not always available) server. ), or it could represent
a server that is willing to act as a proxy and accept a post, or any
other program that can listen on a socket and follow the protocol. 


2: Server hands client a "future" : a URI that is currently unavailable,
but that will be in the future. ( plus optionally and authorization
cookie and schedule advice. ) There should be enough information
returned that a smart client can automagically stash this future
reference away, and do some reasonable polling, based on the schedule
advice. A dumb client should get a refused message, with enough 
additional information that a smart user can figure out what to do
by hand - save this URI somewhere and try to access it later. 


Which of these methods to use, or whether to use e-mail would need 
a negotiation protocol similar to how mime types are handled.

To be fair (something that people don't often accuse me of), John
Ousterhout posted a reply that among other things pointed out some
flaws in RMS' arguments.  As in most things, the truth, I'm sure
lays somewhere in middle ground.

The language issues are being "discussed" on other lists.  And the
issue that I'd rather keep dealing with is whether it might be
a worthwhile extension to the current architecture to allow
users to run scripts in the servers.

A lot of people are saying "what's the value" or "it wouldn't be
secure" or "it would be a burden on the server".  All good questions.

And some people have shown that cgi scripts in conjunction with other
background programs can do some of this kind of work, and can make use
of e-mail as an ad-hoc back channel.

I think robot technology is nice, and it seems to me that there is
value in extending that notion so that the searching and page
aggregation can be performed, according to the user's needs, within
a server itself.

An alternative is to provide a "robot server" that accepts arbitrary
robot-scripts and sits close to a server, polling in endlessly.  I don't
like the feel of that.

Who say's I'm running mosaic or anything like it?  Perhaps I have a tool
on my end that knows how to generate these scripts for the server
and anxiously awaits a reply?

Yes, it would be nice if the internet had an asynchronous delivery
protocol.  E-mail is being used to approximate it, but it is a noisy
channel with high administrative overhead.

I did an asynchronous text file transfer protocol (way back in the
very early 1980's -- before sendmail) and it served this purpose.
IBM's SNADS also serves this purpose.  They could carry e-mail quite
nicely along with other kinds of traffic -- forms, print, etc.  It's
somewhat of an inversion of the concept to try to layer general text
files over e-mail.

So, yes, I wan't an asycnronous path, but I don't agree that this
means e-mail.

"Anxiously awaits a reply"?  So you're talking about deploying an
infrastructure in which there are permanently-available services to
receive these replies?  That's a lot of infrastructure.  I don't see any
reason not to just piggyback it on email.

Why?   This doesn't make any sense to me at all.  You can set up, for
example, an email alias "karl-incoming-stuff@yourhost.com" that takes
all these server alerts and does something with them locally, if you
don't want to actually see them as email.  It can put it into a Web
database that only you can read, if that's your preference.  Or it can
consolidate them and then send you a daily digest of your daemon
reports.  Whatever you want.  Email is ONLY the delivery mechanism.  As
such, I think that it gives you reliable asynchronous delivery without
in any way forcing you to use any particular structure for the end-user
interface.  What can't you do with email?

I don't see why, actually.  Plenty of people are building this kind of
mail-enabled applications.  They can be totally automated, they just
take advantage of email as the only globally reliable infrastructure for
asynchronous delivery.  -- Nathaniel

Sounds like a useful variation.  I had trouble in my "assocation"
mechanism mentioned in another message about buffering response
traffic when the other party is down.  And I've always thought that
it might be nice at times to let the server hold things and do some
polling as an alternative.

The problem is, how long does the server hold on and wait before
throwing the result away?  This is solveable.

Client tells server a preferred window to respond ( we need a syntax
for this, to be able to say "you can get me Mon-Fri between 6 and 9 PM",
and all the typical variations. ) which can ( and should ) include 
a maximum limit. Server can reply and say, "OK, except that *my* max

History, and because much of the world has differnt points of view
on what e-mail should accomplish.

I was amused by a recent posting suggesting that to receive e-mail
based asynchronous replies from a server my web viewer program should
edit my /etc/alias file, run newaliases, and push my YP/NIS maps.  I
wonder what happed to "safe"?

So basically you're replacing sendmail/SMTP with your own more-specialized
protocol.  It still requires your machine to be running when the new document
arrives.

I agree that email is overloaded, but perhaps there's a reason for that.  ;-)

Well, then you need to queue stuff locally at the server and retry
periodically, and hope that it isn't a SLIP connection that just doesn't
happen to be up when you're polling.

And sendmail != SMTP.  Write something that translates sendmail.cf into
something legible for a new mailer and I expect people will flee sendmail.

And that it's the only protocol that already has a bunch of functionality
that you don't get with IP's point-to-point realtime connections.

Now with MIME, you have typed data that can invoke arbitrary programs, either
when the mail arrives or when the user "reads" it.

That's many more levels of cruft than you really need.  Why would you need to
change the routing of email to handle a message saying that a new paper has
been published?

   ...You have to reckon with the possibility that you will use one

I have certainly agree that having _both_ encoding information and

is crucial (without it, the bits are meaningless) while language
information is simply useful (having it allows additional
functionality).  Neither is a good substitute for the other.

Given that  METHOD=GET,  why can't  $doc  be processed  "after the

Yes, it can be made to work, but it is certainly a clumsy architecture.

(My approach would be to e-mail a C program which would be compiled
into a Scheme interpreter which would await a subsequent e-mail with
the scheme program...  :-)

I geuss when all you have is a hammer (i.e. e-mail transport)
everything looks like a nail (e-mail messages.)

E-mail has it problems too.  And it is so overloaded with mechanisms
that it is a noisy, high administrative overhead channel, one that
often takes system level privileges to configure.  Moreover, there are
a lot of non-un*x boxes out there in which e-mail isn't quite as easy
to manipulate.

That's why I'm following this thread (probably much to the bother of
some folk.)

In my own network management related work, we handled this by coming
up with an "association" concept that/protocol that has a lifetime
longer than a single transport (indeed, it is transport agile -- able
to leap to IPX/SPX or dial-up if needed.)

I agree with this 100%.  The problem that remains to be solved is
whether we need a directionality switch.  It's been claimed that
MIME's default "visual" encoding standard just doesn't fit into
HTML and SGML's philosophy, because it anticipates too many aspects
of the presentation - the way clients will choose to display things.
But can we do without it?

It would be theoretically cleaner, for sure, if we all just bit
the bullet and did things "right", i.e., used normal byte order
for all languages, relying on the clients and servers to negotiate
how direction changes will be handled.

For example, the Geometry Center's Cyberview 3D viewer allows  
anonymous users to enter nearly arbitrary OOGL code for viewing.  The  
reason this makes sense is because an execution time limit is imposed  
to conserve resources;  also, the few "dangerous" operators in OOGL  
are disallowed.

More sophisticated resource limits could of course be imposed (e.g.  
memory usage), but given our limited per-user "liability", we feel  
that an OOGL interpreter is a worthwhile service to offer the public.

P.S. See page 117 of the latest WIRED for more info. :-)

I'm waiting (wishing) for the WWW/Mosaic widget that would let the
user click a button ... and the widget would save the user's
existing style sheet ... but instantly substitute, for that
document only, the style sheet selected by the designer.

Seems to me it should not be an impossible programming task ... but
I haven't heard that anybody's actually doing it yet.  (Of course
there are various problems with lack of a standard set of fonts
across platforms and individual machines, and so forth.)

Does anybody else want it?  Is anybody planning to do it?

Cheers,

Subject: PROPOSAL: W3 Advisory Board
content-length: 2586

I tried to send this yesterday, but I didn't see it on the list, so it must
have been lost. Here it is again.
--------------------------------------
I have noticed a couple things lately that trouble me about the way the WWW is
currently being "handled" (or the fact that it's not being handled).

1. I have been thinking about how I'm going to do next year's Best of the Web,
   and have come to the conclusion that I can't.  I don't have time, it's way
   too big now (an order of magnitude in a year?!), and it's not in the realm
   of my current research.  I've had some offers from corporate sponsors, but
   I think it should be really handled in an "official" way (thanks again to
   CERN for being an official sponsor of last year's).  I still believe that the
   BoWeb is an important anchor in the legitimacy and quality of the Web, but
   I can't handle it myself.

2. The discussions here the past few months have made me wonder about the way
   the growth of the HTML and HTTP specs is being managed.  There isn't any
   official way that a proposal is worked out and accepted (or rejected).  W3O\
   is an important body for maintenance of the standard, but it's not really a
   decision-making body.

So, here's my idea:

We should set up a governing body of sorts, called the W3 Advisory Board or W3
Congress or something.  It would be composed of about 50-100 experts in the Web,
(basically the subscribers to this list) including techs, policy-makers,
commercial interests, etc, and would operate under the direction of the W3
Organization (or as part of it).  It would not be a controlling or policing
body, but would make decisions and reccomendations regarding the general
direction of the Web.  It would handle tasks such as:

 - Manage standards: view and discuss proposals, making reccommendations to W3O
   for implementation.

We have used the ROLE attribute and made it the browser's responsibility
to provide the GUI elements for navigational control.  In addition, we
are experimenting with the Dienst notion of multiple content types to
have links associated with the printable form, the appropriate search
and help pages, etc...

I really think the format question should be solved through the server's
response in what formats are available and that printing, searching and
help should be integrated back into the base browser for control (i.e.
when you go to print the document in postscript, download the postscript
version of the document, don't convert.  Same applies for the help menu
bar item and the search functionality.

Funny you should mention that, but I am just in the process of experimenting
with this for the HTML 3.0 proposal.

In HTML+ I extended the LINK element and defined a fixed set of REL
attribute values for this purpose. Using LINK in this way to define
navigation buttons (or menu items) makes it particularly easy to add
hypertext paths or guided tours where a separate list of URLs is used
to insert Previous and Next buttons into the toolbar. In fact the HTTP
protocol even defines a mechanism for using WWW-Link: fields in the
MIME header that are merged into the document head. This gives us a
way of defining toolbars for other document types than HTML.

The basic requirements are:

o   Defining a set of buttons or menu items that can be viewed
on graphical and non-graphical browsers, preferably with
the ability to provide a custom graphic

o   Providing a way for automatically inserting Previous
and Next buttons when following a guided tour

o   Static text such as "Company Confidential"

o   Static images such as corporate logos

In my opinion the position of the non-scrolling area should be a matter
of personal preference, e.g. whether you prefer it to be at the top,
left or right sides, or the bottom of the scrolling area. The security
status of a document *shouldn't* be part of either area to avoid the
worry that authors might work a way of fooling the user with a suitably
chosen graphic. SecureMosaic uses a new region placed next to the globe
device.

Anyway, I hope to get something working, but am running out of time
for WWWF'94. The email load is getting in the way of programming :(

    If you haven't noticed, Motif doesn't allow the mixing of character
    sets in a single text widget - it takes more than a hack of the client
    to display multiple character sets (e.g. Hebrew, Greek, Japanese) on
    the same "page."

    The only way to do this - I haven't tried - would be to use Mule.

    js

This is not entirely true.     It depends on the localization of the
particular system.  AIX is now providing a UTF-8 locale and I believe 
Plan 9 is doing something also with UTF-8.

Actually X11 release 6 did include some support for UTF-8 but it was never
completed.  Finally, UTF-8 has been promoted by the X/Open and Uniforum
Joing Internatioanlization Working Group as the most portable means to 
support UCS on traditional XPG/POSIX systems....

And to prove that it is real...

On the recent AIX 4.1, we provide a UNIVERSAL locale that is based on 
UTF-8 (wchar_t = UCS-2)....  We are currently able to input and display
using the standard Motif 1.2  with our localization for:

ISO8859-1,2,5,6,7,8,9
Japanese/Chinese/Korean
Hebrew/Arabic

This support was demononstrated at the last Unicode Workshop this month.

All of this is using standard Motif 1.2 which is internataionalized such
that it can display in any locale.   In addition we (AIX) provide over 50 
national locales that use the local code set of the territory.  All of this
actually works with the Common Desktop Environment.

This would require by-passing the standard Motif localization and providing
your own localization (fonts, input methods, locale, etc...) along with 
the browser...  I think a better approach is to use the standard
Motif 1.2 internationalization API's and depend on the localization provided
by the Motif implementation.

I know that the (COSE) CDE environment I18N is based on this and is
sufficient for their mail/edit/helps/etc...

I wonder if they are using standard Motif/X I18N functions?

     |>|>No general solution exists.  

I'd say that Motif/X I18N functions should meet the needs of regional 
documents.   

For multilingual documents, the UTF-8 should be the preferred means...

For display and input purposes this is not absolutely neccessary.  We've
build a "universal input method" that allows user to switch from one
language to another and allows user to select characters using planes
of UCS...

Just get a browser that uses the standard Motif 1.2 and X 11 release 5

this will meet the requirements for documents shared in a regional 
environment and ...

then put the requirement for UTF-8 localization from the Motif suppliers
to do multilingual documents ... actually, we should request the

Bill, what you are wishing for is a preference file which is seperate from
the browser.
That way a subscriber to your publication can use the preference settings
*you* prefer for your publication. Now, that begs the question: why would
you want to do that?
The whole idea behind WWW and the browsers is that the reader should be
allowed to use *their own* preference. You could start every home page with
an URL showing what you feel is best for the publication, but what is the
fuss?
In the end it is the content which sells not the typeface.

        My first impression with Vinay's work here is that it's
completely UNIX-centric.   We really must avoid that.   I mean,
if you want to perform prototyping and must have some platform
dependencies for a short time,  okay,  but keep an eye on the
long term  platform independent  goal.

        UNIX can run shells and will be happy with that syntax.
OS/2 and NT will probably swallow it.   DOS or VM/CMS or VAX/VMS might
tolerateit.   But I doubt a Macintosh will be at all happy with it.
It any case,  it will require too many shims on the platforms to which
it isn't native.

        Personally,  I like it.   But you're right:  it's for the
non-faint-of-heart.   And yes,  the scripting languages are becoming
reliably ubiquitous.   But you had explicit shell syntax in your
example above,  which concerns me.

        I don't know anything about  i18n,  but I am in favor of
internationalized clients.   Several weeks ago I mentioned the use of
message codes instead of message text in certain parts of the HTTP
transaction.   If the various response states are represented by
unique numbers,  then those unique numbers can be followed by a
known number of optional replacement tokens  (this is optional)
and in any case the number can be mapped to local language text.

        The idea is that the  *client*,  not the server,
would provide the HTML to hand to its HTML processor for certain
situations,  not only just local results or internal conditions.
Say the server returns a

                HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found

        (can you translate that to Swedish for me?  thanks!)
Your Swedish client would see the  404,  throw away the  "Not Found",
and supply corresponding Swedish text for the user.   CMS Gopher does
this using stock CMS "message repostory" tools.   Sadly,  though,  we
only have one other language besides  EN_US.   Wanna contribute?   ;-)

        I don't have anything to add to the discussion about  (2).

After reading most of the language wars thread on this list,
as well as the thread on gnu.misc.discuss, et.al. : 

 I think trying to choose and anoint "THE" language for the
Web would be divisive and split the Web community into non
communicating camps. After all - one of the great features 
of CGI is that it is language independent - it hasn't excluded
anyone. 

 I think that some of the focus on sending procedures, safe or
otherwise, is due to an unclearly defined problem.  No flame 
intended on Nat Borenstein and others - *I'm* one of the ones 
experimenting with the idea too, but I think _experimenting_ IS
the operative word here. If we knew more exactly about what we 
wanted to do, we could come up with a non-procedural description.
( Which is clearly the safe-est representation of all! ) 

 Particularly on the client side, a non-procedural description would 
be (IMHO) more in the spirit of the Web/HTML/etc.  ( Server "agents"
may be another matter entirely ) Even with a safe system, I don't 
know if I want to give that much control over presentation, popping
up windows and asking me questions, etc. to an outside entity. 
These is a domain for this: I'm using Mosaic as a poor man's GUI 
for some internal projects, but I'm not sure if that makes sense 
in the wider world of the Web. I've read the safe-tcl papers and 
I've said before that I'm not convinced that (please read all the
qualifiers here)  the fine grain of control that I would like is
easily specifiable. ( I don't mean that as much in the realm of 
enabled-mail as in trying to extend it into other areas.) With 
a non procedural description, you can look at it and decide that
you want to display or react to it differently. I think Dan Connolly
pointed out the problems of PostScript and Tex representations - 
you don't know WHAT the heck it represents *until* you have executed
it. A higher-level, non-procedural description doesn't have that
problem, it specifies WHAT should be done, and not HOW. 


 A client-side equivalent of CGI would definitely be nice, but 
considering the greater variation on what can be relied upon on
the client side to implement things, I'm not sure how much can
be done.  On the client-side, we have to deal with a lot more 
proprietary stuff: DDLs and OLE, AppleEvents, etc. The only thing
there that looks like it will be portable enough NOT to make our
life MORE difficult is OpenDoc. ( Exactly how *Open* is OpenDoc ? 
Can we get the full specs without paying money to join the CIL 
consortium ? ) 

[ The ILU stuff from Xerox looks promising, but I haven't yet
  digested the documentation. ] 

Again: no slam on safe-tcl or Nathaniel's work intended. I encourage
he and others to pursue this project. I intend to. ( My interest
in doing it IN Python, rather than just adopting safe-tcl, is due
to the fact that my interest didn't start with enabled-mail, but
with trying to support collaborative and distributed programming
IN Python. I came across his papers on safe-tcl as one of the 
best thought out works on the subject. I understand his desire 
that for it to be an effective standard, defacto or otherwise, 
he would rather see people adopt his scheme that putting energy
into a "competing" product. But adopting safe-tcl won't get me to 
where I'm going. ( But I'm certainly going to install it and try
it, and give it a chance to dispel some of my concerns - but if
I adopt it for enabled-mail, it still won't stop me from trying
to get a safe-Python for other purposes. But thanks for the 
path-breaking work on this! )

A PERFECT example of a "batch" application!

E-mailing a program to the compiler-server would be sufficient 
response time. I suggest an alternate *postal* interface that
accepts express mail delivery of hollerith punch cards and sends 
pack either puched deck output, or paper (with green strips).  

Old IBMers and computer nostalgia buffs like myself would flock
to use the service. ( Any chance of putting up an Intercal 
compile server ? )

WWWinda and W3A provides places to start looking at; a restricted
interface for untrusted accessories should provide some functionality
desired.  (Or should we eschew WWWinda because its implementation uses
Tcl? :-)

This, of course, requires a whole new generation of browsers; that's
fine, but means it will take quite some time and requires a lot of
consensus (is w3org involved in/interested in these sorts of issues?)

> [ list of some pretty good ideas ]

A good list, though obviously any system we create will need to be
sufficiently extensible; there will always be new good ideas.  I'm not
sure exactly what you mean by "scripts can't send messages"; that
seems rather a serious limitation, though it depends what exactly you
mean by "messages."

What's more important is to support old tools, take existing tools and
try to do what we reasonably can with them, and use the lessons
learned to make better tools.  That's what supporting plain text via
FTP while deploying HTML via HTTP and discussing plans for HTML+ via
HTTP/2.0 is about.

Meanwhile, advocating software and network communication protocols
that do not exist is a pointless exercise.  We should do what we can
with what is here while working on what comes next; these things
complement one another.

Since clients will have to cope with `proper' byte order there is no advantage
in also permitting a reversed scheme to make it `easier'. All that would do
is add in an extra case to cope with.

MIME is a bit different, or rather text/plain is different. Here a `treat
all characters as going left to right' mode is easy to do.  But the idea
of block shuffling HTML to work out the logical order of the text gives me
the screaming heebie-geebies, literally.

<p>
this is some text &aleph;&gimel; ordered aleph gimel <lang=hebrew>&gimel;
&aleph; desrever</lang> as was the last bit followed by the word "reversed".
</p>

The problem with the reverse ordering is that it falls apart where there
are multiple words and a line break intervenes. In general the rule should be
to permit arbitary characters in arbitrary contexts (so I can refer to the
aleph collaboration inside english text). But that proper text odering requires
a <lang> environment.

The rules for formatting are quite easy to work out:

1) The margins of the paragraph are set by the language environment that
	the paragraph started in. Ie range left, range right, center, justify. 

	This also sets the main scan order, the starting point for the 
	typesetting after a new line.

2) Typesett each word working out if it will fit, if there is not enough
	space start a new line.

3) If the scan order changes then the space remaining on the line is 
	calculated and typestting continues as normal, except that we do 
	not finalise placing until either the line ends or we have
	another scanning order reverse. 
		
		When this happens we fill in the offsets on the buffered
		segments so that the end of the text in the previous scan
		order adjoins the previous text.

so if we have an imaginary text where e is left right scanning and h is right
left :-

eeeeeeee_1 eeeeeeeee_2 eeeeeee_3  hhhhhh_2 hhhhhhh_1 eee_1 hhhhh_1
hhhhh_3 hhhh_2 eeeeee_1 eee_2


Because we started left to right the second block of hhhh continues at
the left margin.

Well, I really have to disagree with this one point.  The whole point of
extension languages, to my mind, is dealing with the unanticipated. 
Knowing even a lot more about what we will want to do doesn't really
help AT ALL.  If we knew EVERYTHING we might want to do, then we
wouldn't need an extension language, but failing that, we do.  Now, you
can say "non-procedural" but it's not a magic phrase.  There are
non-procedural languages (Prolog comes to mind) but they're just as
dangerous as procedural ones (and a heck of a lot less efficient, too).

Don't worry, I'm really pretty thick-skinned.  And I welcome
constructive criticism.

I think you've captured my argument pretty well here.  I wouldn't dream
of objecting to people building new languages for good reasons; my
biggest concern is to try to reduce the amount of *frivolous*
reinvention-of-the-wheel, because ultimately I think that such work will
have a negative impact on progress towards better global infrastructure.
 The people I really want to persuade are those who might believe that
safe-tcl is really good except for using "that horrible Tcl" as its
language model.  That's the path that could get this whole effort
derailed in "language wars".  And for folks who hate Tcl, I would point
out that there is no language model that won't have SOMEONE hating it;
therefore I contend that the language model really shouldn't be the
deciding factor in the acceptance of this sort of technology. 

I would *love* to hear, however, about anything you want/need to do in
collaborative computing that can't be made to work well in Safe-Tcl.  I
see this as an iterative evolutionary process, and my concern is to try
to make us evolve as far as possible in terms of constructive facility
evolution without getting sidetracked by language wars....  --

I haven't got a problem with users deciding how to view a document. As a
designer, though, I think that I have something to offer the user. I can
enhance the information in a document so that information is communicated
more efficiently.

Allowing the user the option of seeing either the designer's layout or
seeing the user's preferences applied to the layout would be more than
welcome.

>In the end it is the content which sells not the typeface.

If that were the case, there would be no need for the use of multiple
levels of heads, blockquotes, etc. Small changes (such as size, weight, or
style) to even a single typface (even ubiquous Times) can effectively
enhance communication of a document's content.

Typefaces are not all created equal. Some are better suited to use in long
blocks of printed text. Some are better suited to use on a computer screen.
Some are better suited to use in tables.

Good designers will choose the appropriate typeface for the job.

Having said that, I don't think it's neccesary right now to use loads of
obscure fonts in a WWW document, mainly because differences between two
serifed text faces set at 12pt in size are lost when rendered at 72dpi on
screen.

My mistake; no changes to HTTP are needed.

I like Daniel W. Connolly's "Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet" proposal. 
 It solves the same problem "Content-Length:" and "boundary=" do without 
imposing the requirements either of knowing the length of the content a 
priori or of having to scan the data for a boundary.  I would make these 
additions to it:

1. Have each packet header in the form:
     enum { LF=10, CR=13 };
     printf("Packet: %d%c%c", bytes, CR, LF);

2. Define "Content-Type: multipart/file; name=X" where X is the suggested 
filename for that part.  Agents (mail user agents, WWW browsers, etc.) are 
free to rename the file as they deem fit or to reject filenames if they 
violate filesystem access permissions (like "Content-Type: multipart/file; 
name=/etc/passwd");

3. Allow the "Content-Type:" header to occur when a "Packet:" occurs;

4. Force a blank line:
     printf("%c%c", CR, LF);
between these headers and the packet contents; and

5. Once a "Content-Type:" header is seen, the following packets up to the 
next "Content-Type:" or the end of the message belong to the file/part 
specified in the first "Content-Type:".

The resulting data would look like this for two files, each with one line of 
text terminated by a CR-LF pair:

     Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet
     Content-Type: multipart/file; name="capital.txt"
     Packet: 28

     ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet
     Content-Type: multipart/file; name="lower.txt"
     Packet: 28

     abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

These changes create a new MIME type for transferring multipart messages 
(like groups of files) in an 8bit-clean environment.  (1) and (3) are just 
syntactic sugar that might make it easier to code the necessary 
modifications.

If "file=X" was optional for multipart/file, then files could be anonymous 
instead of forcing the creating program to come up with random names.  Not

Subject: WWW/HTML history questions
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
content-length: 1726

Hello!

I've been given the task of talking about the relationship between
SGML and HTML on a Norwegian SGML user group meeting later this year.

As such I find that I lack quite a bit of information about the early
history of WWW and HTML. I'll appreciate all pointers (URLs, references
to papers and articles) to WWW and HTML history.

What I really need an answer to (instead of basing it all on my own,
perhaps faulty, assumptions) are things like:

The current CERN HTML documentation says that the definition of HTML
is based on SGML. Was HTML originally defined with basis in SGML, or
is this an afterthought?

Eg. did the NCSA people use CERN parser code as the "definition" of
HTML (adding their own stuff along the road?)? Or did they base their
implementation on a formally defined SGML DTD?

All pointers, anecdotes, etc. will be much appreciated and given full
credit (or full discression and anonymity, if that's your
preference...:-). 

Thanx in advance!

- Steinar

PS I'm not on the www-talk list so please keep me in a To: or CC: field
   in your reply.

PPS Just to clarify some of what I already know/have done:

 - I'm aware of the HTML 1.0 DTD, Dan Connoly's HTML 2.0 DTD, and the
   ongoing HTML+/HTML 3.0 work.
   Right now I use psgml and emacs with the HTML 2.0 DTD for editing
   and creating HTML files.

 - I'm aware that parsers like Mosaic and Lynx use a custom hand-
   written parser instead of using a full blown SGML parser and a DTD.
   I'm also aware of some of the browser 

 - I've been crawling around in the Webs of CERN and NCSA (and
   hal.com) without quite finding what I'm looking for. I'm also a
   regular reader of comp.text.sgml and the comp.infosystems.www.*
   news groups.

This idea apparently has floated around the Information Retrieval community 
for a while under the rubric of "Selective Dissemination of Information". 
 One paper on SDI that has (IMHO) a pretty decent bibliography is "Index 
Structures for Selective Dissemination of Information Under the Boolean 
Model", by Tak W. Yan and Hector Garcia-Molina,  ACM Transactions on 
Database Systems, Vol. 19, No. 2, June 1994.  From that paper, it seems that 
implementations have usually been by some hard-coded mechanism instead of 
the general-purpose "upload a script" proposed here.  For SDI, TCL 
extensions for searches would seem appropriate.

I'd sure like to see someone implement this -- SDI is on my to-do list if I 
don't soon see code somewhere else.

This doesn't make sense to me, but then that may just be me.  The issues
of localization and multilingualism are distinct.  The above paragraph,

Let me avoid abstraction by giving a concrete example.  Suppose we want
a) a multilingual client and b) to use it in Germany.  To fulfull b, we
might well localize for Germany.  Surely users will want all of the mes-

German, they might well stumble onto an important Bengali or Swahili
information source, and want to read it.  The bottom line is that the
user still wants the German localization.  But he or she nevertheless
wants multilingual facilities as well.

So to repeat, localization and multi-language interfaces are not incom-
patible.  Hence my confusion over why anyone would want to achive multi-
lingualism by broadening localization to include a UNIVERSAL locale.
Seems to be self-defeating.

But of course, as I keep emphasizing, I'm a Humanities person, and new
here.  I may misunderstand.

This is mixing methaphors. For one thing, you can't call it
multipart/* without using the multipart syntax, including
boundaries. And you can't stick any content-transfer-encoding except
7bit inside multipart/*. The MIME spec frowns on complex encodings
(e.g. base64 wrapped up in base64).

Did you see my proposal for aggregate/mixed etc? This allows
the features you're after.

Blech. Parsing of packets is supposed to be quick and dirty.
Don't muck it up with header/body parsing.

Your Packet: header is exactly the Content-Length: header in sheep's
clothing! You're back to the old problem of having to know how big the
body is before you write the headers of the body part.

I agree that content is primary
I also agree that readers should be able to use their own preferences.
(It's essential for making documents accessible to folks with low vision
problems, among other things.)
But as I understand it, there is no convenient way at the moment 
for the reader to know what MY preferences were when I designed the
document ... and easily switch to those for just my document.
It's just possible the reader might like the effect I achieved.

Yes, I could have a url that would display a list of the styles I
had used .. .but as I understand it the user would have to manually
adapt his/her styles to match -- a very laborious process ... and
equally laborious to undo after reading my document.

Why would the reader want to use my preferences?  One example
of many I could cite...
Lets say I write a series of headlines
to a particular count so each will nicely fill
one line on the screen.  If my reader doesn't know what font and size
I used when I wrote the headline ... he/she may end up with an
ugly display that splits the head over two very uneven lines ...
and throws off the view of what else can be taken in at a glance
without scrolling the display.

For the work I'm doing at the moment,
I really don't need to be able to mimic
a multi-column newspaper page display ... but I'd like to give
the reader the option of seeing a very close approximation of
what I saw as I composed the document.

Cheers,
Bill

Be very careful before you make this leap. I've been dealing with
document formats for years, and if there's one thing I've learned,
it's that making documents into programs is fraught with peril.

Keep in mind that as long as the document format is "non-procedural,"
that is, less expressive than a turing machine, you maintain the
possiblity of translating the document to another representation
reliably.

The _instant_ your documents become programs (e.g. nroff, TeX),
document conversion (back to a non-turning-complete language) is as
difficult as the halting problem, and only heuristic solutions are
possible.

It's very difficult to keep system dependencies out of programming
languages. Python does a pretty darn good job, but it still requires a
certain class of machine to run, and many of the useful modules have
to be ported to each new system.

I encourage folks to explore "declarative" ways to express the
features they need. (and use an SGML DTD as a way to specify
the language... it's kinda ugly, but it works...)

Re: Transliteration

Some languages are relatively easy to transliterate: e.g. Russian

Some are really, really difficult: Japanese written in Kanji... where
there is no simple one to one correspondence between a single character
and the transliteration.  To transliterate you need context, and you might
even need to actually understand what is written in order to disambiguate
some cases... and maybe even to put any word breaks into
the transcription, since Japanese doesn't usually have any (and doesn't
need any).  Japanese is readable in English transcription... and for those
gajgin who don't know a whole lot of Kanji, it can be easier.   Once your
kanji vocabulary is big enough, the kanji actually is easier to deal with.

BUT: transcription systems even for something like Russian are not simple.
For English speakers there are at least three different systems in
common use and the choice depends pretty much on use:
	Library of Congress system
	Slavic Linguists system  (lots of hacheks and diacritics)
	Third system whose name escapes me (no diacritics, less precise than ones
					above)
	
A fourth system has also appeared based on a encoding in common use
in the former USSR (I think this is KOI-8, but it may be one of the variants of
it) that pretty much transliterates cyrillic character by chopping off the
8th bit of the character which yields a rough ascii transliteration.... which
can be read off the screen directly that way and is perfectly
understandable and useful.  More than a little bit of email gets
transmitted this way, and some of it never gets transliterated back into
cyrillic.

A second thing to understand about transcription, beyond the fact that there
may be multiple systems within a language, is that the transcription system 
is frequently different for different languages.  The reason you listen to
ballets with music by "Tchaikowsky" is because his name came to us via the
French.  If it had come via some English speaking Slavic scholar, it might
have been "Chajkovskij" (Maybe "C-hachek" rather than "Ch", though).

For a real good time, look at Korean. A fascinating writing system
that I suspect would give a machine transliteration system a run for
its money, although this is way out of the range of languages that I
have studied.

An additional related point:  The English-Arabic dictionary is one thing,
but how about Armenian-Russian or Arabic-Chinese?  One object I heard from
the Russians and Balts that I have spoken to is that even the attempts to 
standardize on expanded character sets have tended to ignore THESE kinds
of mixtures, showing a kind of western europe-fixation that does not solve
THEIR problems.

We're clearly dealing with different goals here.  I want a document that
is able to ask you questions, and execute semi-arbitrary processes based
on your answers.  If you state the goal that broadly, you really do need
this kind of expressiveness, and you definitely sacrifice
translatability, as you point out. 

In fact, this gets to the nub of MY concern for a single scripting
language:  truly extensible documents require compuationally powerful
languages that simply CAN NOT be translated because of the halting
problem.  (It's a fact of theoretical computer science, you can look it
up.)  This is precisely why we need to converge on a single safe network
extension language as soon as possible -- it is because translating
between multiple such languages is permanently infeasible.  -- Nathaniel

Phil provides the following remarkably concise summary of bidirectional
wordwrap methods.  His overall point is that a language and encoding at-
tribute are fine, but a direction attribute is useless, if not harmful.
He's convinced me.

My only worry is that most client implementors won't understand his formu-
lation.  What I'm going to do, therefore, is quote his, then add one of
my own that essentially says the same thing but in different words. What
I'm essentially providing here is a full tutorial.

Save this if you are implementing clients or WYSIWYG HTML editors.

Now me.  First let me begin with an interactive description of how
Arabic would be typed into an English paragraph:

Let's begin on a very simple level.  Let's say I want to na etouq
esarhp cibarA (i.e. "quote an Arabic phrase" written right-left).
Note how "quote an" ends up on the top line, while "Arabic phrase"
ends up on the second.  If I were entering this via an interactive
system, what would happen is: As I added text, the Arabic letters
would appear right where the "n" is in "an" (i.e. "na"). The cursor
would not move.  Rather, the Arabic letters would be "pushed" to-
ward the right-hand margin. When the margin was reached, the cursor
would hop down onto the next line at the far left, and begin pushing
letters toward the margin there. I.e., the cursor stays in place,
and text moves right until it hits the margin, at which point the
cursor hops to the far left of the next line, and once again, and
resumes pushing letters rightward, etc.

This is a fairly simple example, so let me quote a response to some-
one who asked for a kind of tutorial a few months ago.  His questions
are marked as ">  ".  I am not quoting Phil, that is.  The discussion
begins with a question regarding how cursor movement works when mov-
ing across a R-L region of text:

> I assume that cursor keys "<-" and "->" still work visually, that is
> assuming R-L text "54*321" and cursor marked with *, cursor key '->'

Correct!

> result "543*1" and "delete-next-character" "54*21"?

The behavior of delete-next-character or delete-previous-character
will depend on the inherent directionality of the language being used
at that particular moment.  You are quite correct about R-L languages.
The trouble is what happens when you are at a border between R-L and
L-R text.  On this, see below.

> Assuming "abcd*e54321abcde", when "abcde" is L-R and "54321" is R-L
> text, then what is cursor position after application of 3

> simply go visually?
>
>	abcde*54321abcde
>	abcde5*4321abcde
>	abcde54*321abcde

This is correct.  Another method is to create an invisible border
between the L-R and the R-L text that does not appear on-screen.
It would be noticed only when doing what you have done above, i.e.,
to move from a L-R region to a R-L region (or vice-versa).  When the
cursor reaches this border, and a cursor-right (->) action occurs,
the cursor should change color only, and not move (signifying that
it has crossed the invisible border.  After this point, it moves nor-
mally, with the newly acquired color.  Another method is to change
cursor shape.  Still another method (which I've seen implemented)
is to move the cursor just a pixel or two.  The user notices less
movement than he or she is expecting, and this quickly becomes
internalized as a region change.

The reason for all this is simple.  If you are between L-R and R-L text,
and you execute a delete-previous-character command, it is impossible
for the user to know which way the cursor will go unless he has some
visual cue as to which region he or she is in!  Now I can really an-
swer the Q above about deleting characters.  It depends on which color
or shape or whatever the cursor is, i.e., on which region it's in.  If
in a R-L region, the directionality of the delete-next and delete-pre-
vious commands is reversed.

Okay, this raises some really fun and interesting questions.  There
are several possible ways of doing this.  One is purely visually.
That is, whatever you select is what you get.  Internally, however, it
is probable that the 1 above will be near the "e."  That is, the
beginning of the (say, Arabic) word "54321" is the "1", and this will
stand next to the end of the English word "abcde" **internally**.  So as
soon as the cursor hits and crosses the invisible border, you are
essentially selecting the entire chunk of text from a to 1 (visually)
and from a to 5 (internally).  If the pointing device (say the mouse)
is moved to the spot between the 4 and the 3 (abc*de54*321abcde), then
the defined region would be abc[de]54[321]abcde.  This might sound
like science fiction, but it's quite intuitive for anyone who's typed
in bilingual text.  Note that if I start with the pointing device 
between the 4 and the 5 (abcde5*4321abcde), and move it leftward, I
will end up selecting text as expected (visually) until the invisible
border is reached separating English from Arabic text.  At that point,
the defined Arabic region would become inverse.  Let's say that I stopped
selecting text between the c and the d.  The defined region would end
up being abc[de]5[4321]abcde - the same as if I had moved in the
opposite direction, i.e., from between the c and d to between the 4
and the 5.

Again, it's really quite intuitive for people who write bilingual text.
The Arabic, remember, "begins" at the "1" (internally, and not visually
that is).  As a result if I decide to select characters from the
"e" to the "1", I am in reality selecting the end of one English word
and the beginning of an Arabic word.

Now let's get into the question of input order and wordwrap - which will
help clarify the difference between internal byte-stream order and ex-
ternal presentations.

Note first that the Arabic may extend over more than one line.  Let's
use our pseudo-Arabic "54321" example once again, but place this string
close enough to the end of the line that it will have to be wrapped:

1:  abcdeabcdeabcde21
2:  543abcdeabcdeabcd
3:  abcde etc.

Note how the wrapping algorithm works.  I finish typing English at the
last "e" on line one above.  When I switch to Arabic, the cursor
stands in place, and the letters all move toward the right margin:

    abcdeabcdeabcde*1
->  abcdeabcdeabcde*21

When the right margin is reached, the cursor hops to the beginning of
the next line, and the letters continue pushing to the right margin:

    abcdeabcdeabcde*12
    *3

->  abcdeabcdeabcde21
    *43

->  abcdeabcdeabcde21
    *543

Now I begin typing English again:

->  abcdeabcdeabcde21
    543a*

One critical point:  The wordwrap here assumes basic left-right
directionality.  I.e. it assumes English or some L-R language as
setting the primary wordwrap method.  If one selects **R-L** as the
primary direction, then the cursor begins on the right-hand side of
the line, and moves leftward for Arabic text.  If one *then* types in
English, the cursor stands in place, pushing text leftward until it
hits the margin, then it wraps, placing excess characters at the right
side of the next line.  The cursor then remains at the right side of
the next line, and pushes characters to the left.  When the user
switches back to Arabic, the cursor leaps over the English text, i.e.
leftwards over the letters that have been pushed towards the left
margin, and the cursor resumes "normal" operation, advancing to the
left after each character is typed!

           *1       (normal Arabic cursor movement; moves leftward after
->        *21        every char. is typed)
->       *321
->      *4321
->     *54321
->    a*54321       (language switch; L-R language begins; cursor stays
->   ab*54321        put; characters are pushed leftwards)
->  abc*54321

->   abc54321       (margin reached; line wrap occurs; cursor jumps to the
           d*        beginning of the next line; resumes leftward "push")

->   abc54321
           d*

->   abc54321
          de*

->   abc54321        (Arabic text resumes, cursor jumps to the end of Eng.)
         *1de

->   abc54321
        *21de

etc.

What I'm trying to emphasize is that there are two parameters that
need to be set at every instance.  These are 1) the basic
directionality of the text, and 2) the directionality of the
particular language being typed.  Phil already said this above, and
he's right on the money.  I think we can get everything we want here
by generalizing clients' notions of wordwrap, and by adding a lang-
uage and encoding attribute to the HTML standard.

I don't like the old TEI method of identifying language with encod-
ing (e.g. language="ISO 8859-1").  It's not flexible enough.  But I
love the idea of separate language and encoding attributes, and I
love Phil's notion that directionality should always be "natural",
and we should not bother with an explicit direction attribute.

Anyone actually read this far?  I have lots of other things to do,
but I felt it was important to set aside a significant chunk of
my time in order to do a good job of explaining.

I guess my worry comes down to: can you ever really make the unanticipated
safe ? ( I've tried to choose my words carefully when I said I was
"unconvinced" by the paper: I just may not understand the model sufficiently
- I'm the sort that usually needs some hands-on experience before what I have
read falls into place, so maybe after I've actually tried to write a 
safe-tcl script or two, I'll acquire more confidence in it. )

Well - the main point was that I wanted to add safe features to Python
to aid *Python* programming. 

  Not to get into language wars, but one of the things I have found 
about Python is that it's module and O-O class system ( and overloading
of builtin operators ) makes code reuse and collaborative work easy and
practical. I find my code-reuse in other languages tends to be done
mostly in the editor: cut and paste and modify pieces of code. In Python,
I find myself using other peoples modules and classes without having to
poke around in the code. What we've been lacking though, is someone with
the time to organize and document all of the posted and contributed code 
into one package. So I'm looking for a way to _distribute_ the work: 
The plan is to embed Python <CODE> in HTML documents, to get a sort of
hypertext-literate-programming-class-browser-and-documentation-viewer 
and to add a remote "import" to the language. However, the "safe" features
required for this are pretty much the same sort of things required for
enabled-mail and other agent-ware. This did not start out in competition
with safe-tcl (although it was partially inspired by it), but, inevitably,
any alternative *is* competition.

I agree. In fact, I had some initial hesitation to push forward on this
project - I didn't want to be a "spoiler" - so the fact that I am launched
on it anyway - I'm *not* in the "anything but tcl" camp - is one of the
things that makes me sceptical about the success of a procedural language 
based standard of this sort. ( I should add: sceptical, but also hopeful
that I'm wrong! ) 

The other things has been touched on in the gnu.misc.discuss et.al 
language wars:

 I also evaluated tcl and several other languages before I settled on Python
for several projects. Tcl would have actually been a better fit for one or
two of them, but I didn't want to have to support both of them, and Python
looked like a better all around choice - it wasn't as minimal a language as
tcl. TO some extent, that desire seems to be futile: I *will* have to support
Python, Perl, Tcl, Xlisp-Stat, as well as C, Fortran and a couple of others.
:-(

  However - how many languages do I need to use in one program ? 
If I need to write in C and Python and Tcl and XXX, the complexity
of the interfaces between them all starts to become a bigger factor
than the effort saved by "using the RIGHT language for the job". 

Maybe ILU - Inter Language Unification, from Xerox is
the solution to the problem of proliferating interfaces. 

Or maybe writing one language in another - after reading 
the TC tcl compiler paper, I considered trying to write 
a TCL compiler in Python, that would compile into Python's 
byte-code. It didn't look that hard, but it was suggested
to me that that didn't get me too far, as without Tk and
other support modules, it wouldn't bee very useful. However,
now that someone has ported Tk to Python, I may reconsider:
it would yield a faster tcl. The only problem is those 
*damn* interfaces ... All the Tcl code would run unchanged,
but I'ld have to modify any other C-coded support modules
to fit into both Python and Tcl. 

( I saw the references to Rush yesterday, and I'm going to 
  read them at lunch. )

The devil is in the details.  That's another reason we don't want lots
of such languages; the more there are, the more likely it is that a
nasty bug/hole will slip through.  My level of confidence in Safe-Tcl is
moderately high, and was made higher by the fact that when I first
released it, I immediately got several safe-tcl messages by email that
illustrated (in a kind and harmless way) some nasty bugs in the
interpreter (though not the language spec).  I haven't gotten any of
these in a while, which makes me more confident.  The greatest
confidence in this area will come from knowing that lots of clever
people have tried to break it and failed.  The more such languages we
have, the more the hackers will have to divide their attention and the
more likely they are to miss out on important bugs. 

By the way, object-oriented extensions to Safe-Tcl are definitely on the
drawing boards....  -- Nathaniel

Well, this shows a deficiency in the navigational aids for the

What's missing from HTML forms?

I don't see why you don't think HTML forms are a reasonable place to
start in designing WIDL: they're device independent, include the
semantics of what is being asked for rather than the widgets for
presentation, have a possibility of reflecting themselves in
interfaces that are used with pens or voice activiation rather than
typing and clicking. I do think that the forms capability in HTML
needs some more focused attention, and that most of the HTML designers
are currently looking at more traditional document representation
issues (ICADD, SGML, tables). I think there's as much a place for
"semantic markup" for user interfaces (vs, say, what you get from TK)
as there is for semantic markup for text independent of what you get
from PDF.

What's missing from HTML forms? Beyond the ability to ask for files
and other kinds of data stream (which is a BOF/working group which
we're pursuing with some vigor), the ability to selectively enable or
disable interface choices, are there other features present in
interface construction toolkits that aren't here?

But you'd need to know my video resolution, window size, etc. to be able to 
judge what fonts on MY screen would give a 'close approximation' of what's 
on YOUR screen. Rather difficult...

The alternative, of course, would be to design for the lowest possible

Subject: Putting the "World" back in WWW...
content-length: 2446


Microsoft has discussed the Web international issue with some web 
related vendors and would like to make a proposal, but first, let me 
give a few (unofficial) definitions:

Unicode - A 16 bit character encoding scheme that has defined code 
points for every character in virtually every language in the world.  
All common  languages can be expressed in this scheme and include: 
18,000 Han characters set by industry standards in China, Japan, Korea 
and Taiwan; other supported languages include  Greek, Hebrew, Latin, 
Pali, Sanskrit and literary Chinese.  In addition, several hundred 
common math symbols, geometric shapes, and basic dingbats are defined.  
At the beginning of a Unicode document is a two byte signature called 
the Byte Ordering Mark (BOM) of 0xFEFF so clients can resolve big 
endian/little endian differences.

UTF-8 - A special byte encoding that makes full 8 bit transfer over 7 
bit  gateways safe.  Since HTTP is defined to be 8 bit clean, this is 
not needed.


The HTTP protocol (since it is a protocol) will always be in Latin-1 
using 8 bit characters (and hopefully this will move to a binary scheme).

A good solution for the multi-lingual problem would be to use Unicode 
as the character encoding.  Issues of left to right and right to left 
text are simply resolved by the Unicode character code (no language or 
locale information needed).  A document can contain any language at any 
place in the document without special delimiters.  The only limitation 
is whether the browser has the font for the language and supports 
non-left to right languages (which a real international browser should).

To go along with this, I would suggest adding a new MIME type - 
"text/uni-html" that indicates the document is using Unicode.   This 
allows locations that don't need the extra information to not accept 
unicode versions of the documents (saves on bandwidth).  This also 
means that existing servers work and don't care they are serving up 
Unicode docs.  The HTML definition doesn't change except a remark needs 
to be added that if the document is a Unicode HTML document, then the 
BOM will be the first two bytes of the document.

I have been writing Unicode networking applications for many years and 
I'm sold on it's simplicity and elegance.  There is simply no better 
way to internationalize a product.  If other vendors are interested in 
pursuing this with Microsoft, please let me know.

Dan, 

I may have forgotten to credit you, but your "On Formally Unconvertable 
Document Formats",[1] as well as other discussions re: markup vs. 
presentation, were in mind when I was questioning procedural 
representation. Especially your remarks about finding the third word 
in a TeX document. 

 I don't (in some contexts) want a piece of code that opens a window and
prints a message asking me a question, etc. because, if I want to handle 
this by an automated process, instead of interactively, I have 
non-marked-up text to scan ( a program source ) to try to figure out what 
it is doing. *If* the language can be constrained to higher level 
functions that are trivially decipherable, then I suspect whatever it
does can be represented non-procedurally.

Totally a client issue.  Some clients do this correctly.

>From a table in the HTML file?  Ack.  I'd support type checking, along the
lines of only allowing certain types of characters to be typed in (possibly a
regular expression?) or a valid file name for upload-a-file when that becomes
popular.  Those are the only checks that should be done by the client, that
*could* be done, short of smart forms that are really programs in our
much-debated scripting language.  But those would be quite nice, yes.

I actually see a great future for SGML, as having richer markup
is just what you need if you want to do knowledgebased typography.
Right now when you maximise a Mosaic window, it looks a mess with
very long text lines right across the screen. Imagine instead the
advantages of getting a multicolumn magazine like appearence, where
the layout, including the number of columns etc. changes to suit the
current window size.

A knowledgebased approach allows the information provider to keep
stylistic control while adapting to the user's preference settings
and the fonts etc. available in the client. All this works much better
with richer markup, and will ensure that low-level page-description
languages play a minority role. MIT's Media Lab has been pioneering
these ideas and I am looking forward to exploiting them on the Web.

No John, the content type is orthogonal to this the tag you want is :

Content-Encoding: Unicode


Yes we are very interested in Unicode. Main problem in the short term is 
the question of generic fonts etc. To work we need Unicode for every
platform. X11 supports 16 bit fonts already.

I would like to adapt quite a bit of libwww to use 16 bit codes internaly
in any case.

Yes, it's completely a client-side issue.

OK so either you send the validation table as part of the document, and the 
client uses it (this is in effect sending the client a program to execute) or 
you send the entry to a server to validate (which implies the server maintaining 
some sort of state on the completion of the rest of the form.) Either way, yes, 
it's currently missing.

Multi-document forms are possible but a bit of a pain. Take a look at 

http://www.lpac.qmw.ac.uk/SEL-HPC/Questionnaire/JiscQuest_man.html

which uses a form split over four documents. It does not do validation, but the 
multi-document structure would allow individual chunks to be rejected and 
returned for valid completion. It uses hidden fields to save state. No, I didn't 
write it.

Excerpts from www-talk: 30-Sep-94 Why documents? (was Languag.. A M. I.
t. Future@media. (1234) 

> Why do you want *documents* that do this?  It sounds a lot like what you 
> want is *programs*.  Now, we may entertain the argument that says there is

Well, you could play with words and say that what I want is documents
that have programs attached.  That's fine.  I tend to think it
translates into more or less the same thing.  I definitely want to be
able to add arbitrary user interaction to the semantics involved in
viewing a file. 

To try and illustrate the interconnectedness of documents and programs,
let me go off on a bit of a tangent.  Imagine a standardized universal
generic document architecture -- we'll call it HTML++^^* -- that makes
this clean separation, so that it has a markup language with program
"attachments".  Now, you can imagine translating HTML++^^* into ODA, or
Troff, or whatever you want, assuming that they also have appropriate
"attachment" capability, and that translation might well be (with a few
strange exceptions that don't really matter very much) computationally
tractable.  Document translation is really hard, and fraught with peril,
but at least theoretically possible.  But what computational theory
tells us is that the attached programs are themselves NOT translatable
to other languages in the general case.  To my mind, this says that we
really HAVE to have a standardized programming language.  

Now, I think we all agree that a standardized document architecture,
even though it might be theoretically a bit less necessary, would be a
Very Good Thing.  If you were to turn everything on its head and embed
your document architecture *inside* your programming language, you'd get
the document format standardization as a *consequence* of the
programming language standardization, as an "added bonus".  Note that
I'm not actually advocating this approach -- I think Postscript is a
very good example of the limitations of this approach, in fact, and of
the way that solving one problem can create twenty more -- but merely
trying to point out that the two areas are more interconnected than is
apparent at first glance.   

Do I know what the ideal solution is?  Absolutely not.  But I do feel
confident that the best way to move forward is evolutionary development
based on proven models and technologies.  I think embedding a
Safe-Tcl-like programming language inside an HTML-like simple markup
format is the obvious next step in this direction.  There will be
problems with it, and inadequacies, of course.   That's how evolution
works.  

Does it have to be Safe-Tcl?  No.  Does it have to be HTML?  No.  But
using things that already exist and work reasonably well will allow us
to focus on fixing the inadequacies in those systems, rather than on
inventing new systems that will have their own unanticipated
inadequacies.  It will get us there faster, that's all.  -- Nathaniel

I agree that the agreegate/mixed stuff loos interesting but not about the
MIME stuff. In HTTP we junk parts of IETF specs that are simply kludges
to allow the stuff to operate in environments that are not 8 bit clean.

HTTP is 8 bit clean. it extends the use of Content-Length: tags and
8 bit encoding inside MIME multiparts. In the same way the security
extensions, Shen which are effectively PEM do not encode the body in
base64, it goes 8 bit clean.

Not if you send multipart/partial. Then you send out chunks as you can.
It is not pretty but it does at least avoid having to create a new packet
scheme. I think that that scheme belongs in an optimised Binary-HTTP
(B-HTTP). Optimising packet transport without sorting out the RFC-822
nonsense makes little sense. I would prefer to define an optimisation
for the complete set of IETF protocols, a binary mode and as part of that
derrive a packet form of the multipart schemes.

But this is way in the future, at least three months. First we need to get
some other RFCs done, An HTTP2.0 describing current practice, and a trio
consisting of architecture description, security issues and multi method
extensions (MM-HTTP). B-HTTP would be an orthogonal global optimisation,
possibly ASN.1 ish in flavour.


The reason I do not want a mixed binary/rfc-822 scheme is that the code
gets much more complex. I have a scheme for piecewise inserting synthetic MIME
parsers into libwww and leveraging binary transport via a rewrite of the
synthesizer. The result would be an RFC-822 header and Binary encasulation
browser.

I would expec the main scenario to be using P-HTTP (plain HTTP) to estblish
the connection for a conference (main case of not knwing the length in
advance), The accept would mention that it accepted B-HTTP encoding to
a particular spec. The other side would grock it and issue a switch
protocol tag and henceforth the rest of the multi-method session would be
B-HTTP. Other tricks to play with this would be to use HTTP authentication
to establish a connection then pass the secure connection (plus shared
session secret) to another protocol such as X-11. This would be a neat
method of exporting HTTP armouring to other protocols. 

Hopefully this would cover the comments made by Simon Spero re efficiency.

I would also like to see other WWW interfaces hardened in the same way,
ie BGI should be congruent to CGI and conversion from one to the other
should merely be a jacket routine. This is very important when you want
a service to run in the client and not force the user to go via a server.

This assumes that Unicode is the be all and end all of coding schemes,
and I don't think that that's a reasonable assumption.  8-bit schemes
will be around a long, long time; and probably 32-bit schemes will be
used as well.  There has to be sufficient flexibility to allow for any
scheme - not just the one favored by Microsoft and the Unicode Consor-
tium.

Of course, let me admit to you on the side that it would be ideal to
have an all-encompassing scheme we could all agree on - one that all
computers would use from now until the next millennium.  But it ain't
gonna happen.  Despite Microsoft's support of Unicode, for instance,
I don't see any intrinsic support for it in Chicago, despite the huge
amount of resources Microsoft has to devote to it.  If Microsoft it-
self isn't able to jump on the bandwagon, how can you expect, say,
people in the Soviet Union to do it?

Aside from the practical matters, I might add, there is also the lar-
ger reality that many don't agree with the approach the Unicode Con-
sortium has taken.  It would be downright inhospitable to force such
people to conform.  Very un-Web-like.

>To go along with this, I would suggest adding a new MIME type -

It's already been suggested here - by Dan or Phil or some other in-
cisive mind - that we'll need language and encoding defaults for
every document.  If not otherwise specified these should be Eng-
lish and ISO 8859-1 (for backwards compatibility).  There should
be no problem specifying Unicode explicitly as the default encoding
scheme, and as you note there should be no problem having clients
that can't handle it reject documents so composed.

The reason we need language defaults is that, as we just hashed out
a few days ago:  You can't assume a one-to-one correspondence be-
tween encoding scheme and language.  Sure, with Unicode you can for
the most part (what every happened with the "Han unification" issue?)
But not with a lot of other coding schemes.

  this is a client issue.  Currently, Mosaic 2.4(TUEV version), lynx,
emacs-w3, and spyglass mosaic allow you to do this.  Not sure about cello
or any of the mac browsers.

> 2 -- valid an entry (FAVLT: from a very large table) for correctness 

  Some validation is part of the spec - that is what the TYPE specification
is for, but I don't think any browser but emacs-w3 bothers to check that
type of information.  Mosaic/X will happily allow you to enter ABC into a
field of TYPE=INT or TYPE=FLOAT, or 123 into TYPE=DATE, or anything into
TYPE=URL.

  How would you propose looking up the value from a very large table?  If
more clients would 'remember' the form data you entered, you could just do
this all on the server side, but currently WinMosaic/AIRMosaic and a few
others have problems doing this, so the user has to retype in all the form
data if they get it wrong the first time.

  One thing that would be really nice from a users point of view would be
checkboxes and radio buttons that you could set a label on.  Right now, if
you have a form like:

[ ] Checkbox 1
[ ] Checkbox 2
[ ] Checkbox 3
^^^ You have to click exactly on the checkbox/radio button to toggle the
state, where standard UI behavior is being able to click on any part of
'[ ] Checkbox 1'.  How about something like:

<input type="checkbox" label="Checkbox 1" value="primed">?  Anybody else
think this would be useful?

(First of all, although it's no big deal, I really dislike "Nate" -- I
tell my Girl Scout troop that they can either call me "Nathaniel" or
"Dr. Borenstein", and it's amazing how many choose the latter.) 

Anyway, false is kind of a strong term, but I do think your dichotomy
misses the mark.  I think that there are really two pieces to a
presentation engine such as Mosaic:  the program that does the
presenting, and the documents that it presents.  So far, this sounds
like your dichotomy.  The difference is, I think that the documents that
such programs present ALSO need to be able to include arbitrary programs
of their own.  That is, there's the built-in process and the
per-document extended process.  I think it's the latter that we're
talking about here.  (At least, that's what *I* am trying to talk
about.... :-)
