Judith--

I certainly agree that library-quality transliteration is not trivial,
and in many cases is impossible.  As you say, there is no reasonable
way to transliterate Japanese Kanji, and many scripts have multiple
transliterations.  And even having a language attribute is in general
insufficient -- as you point out, there are multiple systems for
transliterating many languages (this of course should be a client-side
setting).  In any case, as I said in my last note, language tagging is
useful for many things.  It is simply not critical in the way encoding
tagging is.

But all of this goes far beyond my original point, which was simply
that browsers which are unable to display, say, Arabic, can choose to
display a transliteration instead (NOT a transcription, which is in
general impossible for unvocalized Arabic).  If Arabic comes to me in
an HTML document, and I don't have the appropriate fonts, I would much
rather see "'l'skndry2h" than "#########".  With the former, I have some
chance of recognizing it as al-Iskandariyyah i.e. Alexandria.

   An additional related point: The English-Arabic dictionary is one
   thing, but how about Armenian-Russian or Arabic-Chinese?  One
   object I heard from the Russians and Balts that I have spoken to is
   that even the attempts to standardize on expanded character sets
   have tended to ignore THESE kinds of mixtures, showing a kind of
   western europe-fixation that does not solve THEIR problems.

No one is "ignoring" these problems.  There are two basic ways to
solve them.  1) Define a way of mixing different encoding systems in
one document and 2) Define a universal character set which covers all
necessary characters.  Both ways work, although solution (2) is
cleaner and simpler -- but requires 16 bits/character.  I suspect that
(1) and (2) will have to coexist for the forseeable future.

Solution type (1) requires conventions for switching codesets in the
middle of a document, as is done by ISO 2022 (?), and the proposals
being discussed in this thread.  This solution is rather clumsy, but
works.

Solution type (2) requires defining a universal character set.  There
is in fact such a character set, namely Unicode/ISO 10646, and it is
apparently being seriously considered for use in HTML.

Unicode covers just about every writing system you can think of,
including Latin, Greek, Cyrillic (with all the different extensions),
Arabic (with all the different extensions), Hebrew, Armenian, Laotian,
Chinese (both ideograms and Bopomofo), Japanese (kanji, hiragana,
katakana), Korean (both ideograms and Hangul), Devanagari (with all
the different extensions), Oriya, Tamil, and many other Indian
languages, Tibetan, Mongolian, Ethiopian, and many many others.
Recent proposed extensions include Aramaic, Cherokee, Etruscan,
Glagolitic, Linear B, Ogham, Old Persian Cuneiform, Ugaritic
Cuneiform, Northern Runic, Epigraphic South Arabian, etc.  It is true
that there are some important scripts that are missing, mostly because
there are serious open philological questions.  This includes the
Akkadian, Sumerian, and Babylonian cuneiform systems, Hittite, Linear
A, etc.  If you have questions about how Unicode works, etc., I
suggest you take them off-line, because this is peripheral to WWW.

In response to the objections raised that ...
a. not all monitors are the same size
b. not all monitors have the same resolution
c. not all computers have the same fonts.

Yeah, I know that ... but I'd be happy to be able to design
for the vast bulk of Windows and Macintosh machines that have
at least 640 x 480 resolution ... and reasonable approximations
of Times and Helvetica.  I'll accept a lot of constraints
if in trade I get to give the user the OPTION of seeing
the document the way I designed it. 

(I see no point at all to designing documents with exotic fonts
if only 2 percent of my viewers have those fonts -- now that
would really be a waste!)

I suppose, however, that the widget could be extended
to be able to say to the user --
oops, you haven't got the font needed to optimize this document
... so what you see may not be what the designer intended.

Cheers,
Bill

Well, more to the pint is that Will's Widgetron would either have a user 
pref, or a dialog box, and it would say "should I get the missing font?" 
and it'll zap back and obtain said code object.

I suppose there would have to be a pref called something like "flush 
exotic fonts" which would get rid of those (locally) when you're done.
Of course you could choose to keep them.

This isnt' greatly different in princile from AOL and eWorld downloads of 
PICTs and icons to your local hard disk.

I'm a "few font man" but many other Mac owners I know has 40 or 50 fonts. 
Or 80.

Chicago is a friendly environment for applications that wish to use 
Unicode for their character encoding.  It has full support for 
character conversion plus Unicode versions of TextOut and CharWidth 
Window APIs.  The primary reason the core of Chicago is not Unicode is 
due to the large existing code base that would have to be converted in 
the necessary timeframe.  Portions of Chicago are Unicode.  Windows NT 
is fully Unicode.

Microsoft is absolutely committed to open standards, especially on the

From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 7744


[For those on the scheme48 list, this is in response to some
discussions on www-talk and comp.lang.python about exploring ways to
host untrusted programs. Some folks are considering doing to the
python interpreter what other folks have done to Tcl to make
Safe-Tcl.]

Hmmm... Safe Tcl is the most mature system of its kind (it's kind
being restricted to open systems -- telescript is possibly more
mature). Still...  Tcl give me the heebee-jeebees. I wish I could
prove a theorem like:

	"Construct X (which has been essential to the development
	of distributed hypermedia applications) will always
	have a super-quadratic running time in Tcl, whereas in
	languages with richer type systems, the running time
	is linear."

I have a feeling there's one out there, but it seems like nobody
has found it yet.

One answer is "well... you can always write the performance-critical
parts in C" but that doesn't apply to the Safe-Tcl scenario where you're
sending your code to run on an interpreter on somebody else's machine.

Anyway... the point of this message is to explore the possibility of
supporting mutliple languages by making the safe-computing platform a
virtual machine, rather than a programming langage.

I like the scheme48 virtual machine[1] -- especially the performance.
But the heap technology isn't mature yet (the current release uses a
stop-and-copy collector, but incremental/generational collectors are
"in the works") and the foreign function interface is raw (though
there's a scheme shell, sort of a perl work-alike, and it's author
says the foriegn function interface is maturing). The scheme48 virtual
machine supports full continuations and threads.

The python virtual machine[2] is a proven success, but it's threads
support seems kinda flakey, and its reference-counting implementation
is a pain in the butt for C interfacing.

I understand there's a Tcl compiler called RUSH (I need to read up on
this: somebody wanna send me a pointer?). Ironically, I hear that it
compiles to scheme.

The "plug-n-play" technology for multi-architecture bus cards being
deployed in the PC/workstation arena uses some forth-based virtual
machine to initialize the cards, rather than having machine code for
each architecture for initialization.

Let's explore the plusses and minuses:

	- Safe Tcl is mature technology. If we don't stick to safe-tcl,
	  we have to do a whole bunch of engineering over again.
	  We can re-use some of the knowledge and perhaps some of
	  the code, but "warm fuzzies" are not reusable.

	- Shipping byte codes around rather than source code precludes
	  the possibility of having an optimizing compiler on the compute
	  server. One can argue that it's best to represent the problem
	  at the highest level of abstraction possible, and let the
	  receiving end be responsible for optimizing the concrete
	  solution to the problem.

	  I think this is an unrealistic characterization of the situation.
	  Server developers are going to want to link in a "libSafeComputing.a"
	  and be done with it.

	+ Shipping byte codes around allows for the possiblitiy of
	  an optimizing compiler in the development environment. It allows
	  for development in a variety of languages: Tcl, scheme,
	  python, SmallTalk, etc., given the right kind of virtual
	  machine.

	+ Shipping byte codes around puts the lexing, parsing, and
	  syntax-error checking on the client side. Plus: these
	  tasks will only be done once per version of code, rather
	  than once per execution of code.

	- Shipping byte codes around requires more technology on
	  the client side. You won't be able to just have a form
	  that says: "Type your program here:" and runs the program --
	  that is, unless you're willing to compile the program on
	  the server side.

	  Again, I think this is a rare scenario. Any application
	  where the end user is required to do programming is bound
	  to fail. We must stop making users play the "what sequence
	  of characters will get the machine to do what I want?" game.
	  The tremendous success of Mosaic is yet another piece of
	  evidence that visual interfaces make people productive and happy.

I think that portable source code is a myth. By its nature, source
code is for human consumption and manipulation. A body of code is not
really reusable until it's reached the state of a shared library or
DLL. (The possible exception being Ada/Modula-3 generic modules,
and to some extent, C++ template classes.)

Part of the mess we're in with HTML is because the "code" goes from
the author, through the server, to the display client without ever
going through any kind of compiler/validator/syntax checker.

On the one hand, it seems easier to exhaustively examine the behavior
of a bytecoded virtual machine than the behaviour of the set of
programs expressible in some high-level language. On the other hand,
the important issue is the safety of the system at a macro level. Just
because no one bytecoded instruction can cause damage doesn't mean
that a large program -- or worse, a collection of programs -- won't
exhibit antisocial behavior. In a way, it's more a problem of
analyzing a nonlinear dynamical system than looking at a
state-machine.

I'm sorry I don't have a concrete proposal. In a way, I'm generating a
bunch of heat and not much light. I think I've got a good idea, and
I'd like to get some impressions. Ideally, somebody with more time for
this sort of thing will go off and try it and prove that my idea is
workable or that it is really bad.

To be somewhat concrete, let's describe a hypothetical system
called Safe-VM:

Hmm... the more I think about it, the less interesting it becomes to
think about executing completely untrusted, anonymous programs. The
interesting part is to allow programs access to exactly the set of
resources that they are authorized to use, and to support accounting
for the use of these resources.

A truly anonymous program might begin executing with with finite
resources: a certain amount of memory and some CPU time.  To gain
access to the filesystem, network ports, databases, more compute time,
or more memory, I see three options:

(1) In an interactive session, (like a program that runs inside Mosaic
to control a smart form) the virtual machine could present a dialog to
the interactive user:

	The 'fractal image display' task has consumed the default
	maximum memory resources, and requested 5MB more.
		<Grant Request>  <Abort Task>

(2) In a batch session, the program would have to be certified by some
principal that is authorized to use the resources. For example, the
bytecodes might get to the server with a certificate that says 'This
program is allowed to access databases X, Y, and Z.  It can use 50MB
of disk space for intermediate query results.'  An interesting way to
deploy an authorization/accounting system like this is given in a
paper by Cliff Neuman[3].

(3) If the program can begin execution with a communications channel
back to the user that owns it, it can begin executing anonymously,
and use the communications channel to satisfy challenges to gain
access to resources. For example:

	def auth_callback(encrypted_nonce):
		... send encrypted_nonce accross channel ...
		... it gets decrypted on the other side, and sent back ...
		return result

	x = gimme_a_database_access_cookie("Personnel Files", auth_callback)

	x.read_records(...)

This is why people have been working on platform-independent,
application-independent, font-independent portable file formats like Acrobat

I didn't mean to put you on the defensive.  I'm delighted that Micro-
soft is trying to make Chicago "Unicode friendly."  One of the great
desiderata for Windows has been a multilingual/multidirectional word
processing system like Nisus for the Mac.  It'll be easier now to at-
tain that goal.

My sentiment, though, was that Unicode will never be the only system
around.  Scripts constitute a field unto themselves, and I simply do
not feel that standardizing on one encoding system will ever satisfy
everyone or leave enough flexibility.

Doubtless, though, ISO 10646 will become increasingly important as
time goes on.  Thanks for sticking your neck out.  Mine's right there
beside it :-).

I haven't looked at Safe-Tcl, but I doubt there's any non-linear
performance penalty.  If Safe-Tcl is Turing-complete, you can build an
interpreter in it for any language you like.  There'll be one
interpretation cycle in Safe-Tcl for each atomic action of the
interpreted language.  If there's an upper bound on how long it takes
to interpret all possible atomic actions, then that's the upper bound
of the coefficient of the linear relationship.

Unfortunately, it's not enough to limit the time penalty to merely
linear.  People go to great extremes to save relatively small factors
-- at least small by theoretical computer science standards.  Even a
modest factor of two seems interesting to people, to say nothing of a
factor of ten.

Fair enough. You missed a few I think are important. However, I think
the script language should double as a macro facility for the users,
which adds a number of things:

      o   scripts can manipulate the GUI directly (open/close/resize/move
	  windows & dialog boxes)

      o   scripts are associated can be associated with a specific
	  window in a multiwindowed browser.

      o   scripts can feed HTML to the Browser for display.

      o   scripts can change the browsers preferences settings.

And you've got one odd one here:

>     o   scripts can't send messages

Why not? That's the most useful thing about the scripting extensions
I use in Mosaic. Turning this off for "unsafe" scripts is probably a
good idea, but that's no reason to leave it off for everyone.

*Exactly* my reasoning behind suggesting a "safe shell".  Constraining 
ourselves to any one language is antisocial, nonprogressive, and 
anti-WWW-philosophy (as I see it).  I'd like to put up Perl scripts, C 
code, and even binary code for different platforms - even if there were 
a safe Perl I wouldn't write everything in that.

The 'smart form' task wishes to open a socket connection to port 25
(sendmail) on whitehouse.gov.

The 'geometric viewer' application wants to read the file "/etc/passwd".

It seems that at least in terms of protecting operating systems, which can be
defined by a limited number of subsystems each of which can be explicitely
monitored, this system would work.  The client could even specify certain
allowed things, like "can always write to /tmp". 

The thesis that "specifically allowing certain actions is safer than
specifically prohibiting others" can be integrated into this, one would
think. 

The main argument I heard to this was that shells would be hard to implement
on some systems, such as the Macintosh.  I don't know what to answer to that,
other than I'd have to gain a deeper knowlege of the Macintosh architecture
before being convinced.  Second opinions anyone?

In the lisp system I have mentioned, we used multiple virtual machine
for executing scripts with each script being "tagged" such that
certain capabilities were enabled/disabled depending on where
they orginated etc.

I cannot give out many details, and there are probably only
Japanese papers, but the system did work quite well.

While I like the virtual machine idea, I'd prefer that
distributed object systems be used.

Excerpts from www-talk: 1-Oct-94 How about a Safe Virtual Ma.. "Daniel

I like this idea a lot in theory.   I'm not sure how feasible it is in
practice, though -- it will take some fairly serious thought and
experimentation.  My biggest concern is the mixing of levels of
abstraction.  It turns out that one of the most essential features in a
"safe" language is a customizable user confirmation process.  The more
specifically the program can describe the action that needs to be
confirmed, the more likely it will be that the user can make an
intelligent choice.  Thus, a user stands a much better chance of
answering intelligently when asked: 

"This program is trying to send mail to 'president@whitehouse.gov' with
a Subject of 'Die, Commie Dog!' and a body of.....<text in scrollable
region>......   Do you want to permit this mail to be sent?" 

than when asked 

"This program is trying to execute the 'exec' system call with an
argument list of '/usr/lib/sendmail -t < /tmp/mm1824'.   Do you want to
permit this system call to be executed?" 

(Note that this is just a simplified example, I would never advocate
giving ANY such access to 'exec' or similarly broad functions, having
seen so-called safe-languages that did this.)  The point is that the
confirmation process is most effective when it can reflect user-level
semantics for user-level confirmation.  This means that the "machine
code" for an SVM (Safe Virtual Machine) probably has to look rather
different from the "machine code" for most VM's.  In particular, you
probably want atomic primitives for user-level things like sending mail,
limited file system access, and so on.  This is by no means impossible
(I think), but it does mean that this is NOT your father's Virtual
Machine, not by a long shot. 

(As an aside for any potential implementors out there:  Note that the
confirmation process can't just be a subroutine called by the program in
the safe-langauge, because if the program has the power to take
differential action based on the result of that subroutine, it has the
power to skip the confirmation subroutine altogether, or to spoof the
question to make the action contemplated seem misleadingly benign.  Thus
the confirmation process has to be invoked from WITHIN the SVM
"primitive" operation.  Then, to make matters more complicated and
level-mixing still, the confirmation process must use the right user
interface paradigm for the current interaction environment, which
probably means calling back up to the outermost layers of abstraction,
but in manner that can't be subverted by untrusted code.  Safe-Tcl
actually gets all this right (I believe), but the implementation is more
complicated than you might think.  Be careful!)

I'd like to separate your basic proposal for an SVM from the above
claim, because I'm a big believer in portable source code.  The above
claim is not, however, necessary to support the desirability of an SVM,
so I'd prefer to drop it from this thread.

I think theoretically they're just the same.  In practice it is probably
easier for a human with source code and for a program with byte codes.

Right, and this is also why you need to be able to hook the capabilities
system with the authentication information that comes in from PGP or
PEM, too.  The current safe-tcl interpreter has hooks for this, but
those hooks have not yet been attached to PGP or PEM to complete the
picture. 

To my mind, the biggest open question is whether an SVM is really
feasible, when you take into consideration the way that the
user-confirmation process affects levels of abstraction.  When you
consider, for example, all the parameters that are needed for a "send
mail" primitive, you can see why there aren't any REAL machines out
there on which "send mail" is a primitive machine instruction.  My
concern is that by the time you make the SVM complicated enough to
handle such highly structured "machine instructions", it may end up
looking a lot like a high-level langauge such as Safe-Tcl!  

I'm taking the liberty of re-sending some of these messages to the
safe-tcl list, as I'm sure there will be interest there.  -- Nathaniel

Well, I had hoped to get this into an HTML form that you all could help 
me keep updated, but that's turning into a bigger hassle than it's 
worth.  

Those of us on the content side are getting antsy to start basing services
on forms and user authentication.  Well, more than antsy.  As a part of
this I've come up with a table of different browsers and their
capabilities in this respect.  Within 6 months I hope this will be a moot
exercise, but for now we need it, particularly those of us who want to 
support as many people and platforms as possible.

So, here's the information I've compiled so far regarding browsers and
their capabilities, and which revs of those browser had it solidly
implemented.  If I don't know when certain features were implemented, I
simply say "yes" or "no". Please let me know if you can fill in some of
the gaps or have corrections - private email would probably be best, and I
can post the updated table if there's interest. 

As an aside, I've been tracking browser usage on my site for a couple of 
months now, and over the last week there's been a huge surge in the 
number of accesses from clients that don't pass along their name, from 
about 5% to 23% of all accesses, and looking at the log doesn't turn up 
anything significant, other than most of them come from hosts without 
real hostnames, just IP numbers.  Hmm.

Subject: File XFR Proxy, Take 2
content-length: 918


A couple of weeks ago, I posted that some folks and I were considering
hacking up an httpd to implement an XFR or RCOPY method, which would
transfer a file to a client through an intermediary system.

A small number of folks wrote email, either saying it was a cool idea
or an unbelievably dumb one.  After playing around with the issues, and
getting further through that mess o' spaghetti code known as the NSCA 
httpd, I've come down on the side of those who said it was a dumb idea.

We've implemented the file transfer mechanism as an nph- CGI script done
in C.  Does just what we want, and doesn't break a stock server.

Cool.

Thanks to those folks who sent mail--even the flames.

Subject: rewrite of NCSA httpd ?
content-length: 437


I've just spent the past six weeks wading through the biggest collection
of spaghetti code I've ever seen in my life: the NCSA httpd.

Global vars up the wazu.  Bad C.  No comments.  Pointless comments (e.g.,
"...what a pain in the ass..." ).

It's crying out to be rewritten in a readable and maintainable fashion.

Has anyone done this, or would anyone be interested in collaborating on it?

email replies preferred for now.

Will you stop whining about other people's code in a technical forum.
NCSA httpd is a prototype that has evolved as a result of dozens, if
not hundreds, of people making suggestions for new features and
demanding fast action, and Rob did a great job in that.  His code is
much much better than could ever be expected considering the
circumstances.  I can tell you are new in the Web community so you
have no idea about the pressure that server authors were under those
days.  Rob was often quoted as everybody's hero, he even made it to
the Web Hall of Fame.

> Global vars up the wazu.  Bad C.  No comments.  Pointless comments (e.g.,
> "...what a pain in the ass..." ).

In fact, those kinds of comments are the best.  They point out very
clearly tricky parts in the code.  Plus they're fun.  Don't be a
bore.  Do you prefer reading telephone directories?  :-)

See referenced text, below. 

Dear Marc -- 

Actually, I'm a sr software engineer, and wrote c/s apps for SunOS 
for six years.  In the past two years, I've written them for MS 
Windows and, currently, I write them for MS Windows NT. 

So no, I'm not quite new to the programming thing.

I'm also chasing down an M.S. in computer science and an M.A in
anthropology.  Concurrently. 

The NCSA code sucks for air.  I've written enough "pressured" code
to sympathize, but the facts are the facts.  Can't help it, but I am 
offering to HELP REWRITE IT FOR FREE.  Or did you see red so soon 
that you missed that part? 

I offer this because I admire the NCSA httpd functionality, and
wish to help make it easier to extend and maintain.  

I'll accept your apology, or completely disregard your brainless 
knee-jerk reaction and start fresh, as you prefer.  The default
will be the second of the two. 

Apologies for dragging everybody else into this, and the chest-thumping,
but given the content of Marc's posting, it seemed appropriate. 

End of topic, as far as I'm concerned.  If you're interested in 
exploring collaboration on a rewrite of NCSA httpd, then please
SEND ME EMAIL as I originally requested. 

Regards, 

Richard

Hm...  I think the whole idea of a "safe virtual machine" won't work.
As Nathaniel points out, the operations that need to be verified or
confirmed (etc.) are usually at a much higher level of abstraction.
When thinking (as a result of this discussion) about making Python
safe, maybe 95% of the unsafe operations are library functions -- 4%
are high-level operations that negotiate access to the library
(e.g. importing modules); only a tiny fraction of unsafe operations
are close to the level of the Python virtual machine (such as object
attributes that provide read-write access to internals of the
interpreter).

>New to this whole programming thing, hm?

Richard,

Sure, Marc may have seemed a bit presumptive with that caustic remark,
but you most certainly deserved it.  Yes, the code is spaghetti, but for
many good reasons -- Ari mentioned just a few.  Personally, I've seen much
worse (and it wasn't even free).  NCSA httpd is mostly nasty because it
works on 40-odd different platforms, including such bone-headed examples
as NeXTOS, AIX, and Solaris, and each platform was added one at a time
(often via patches from elsewhere).  Rob certainly knows it is spaghetti --
he was planning on re-architecting the whole bloody thing, but got swept
off his feet [by the MCom wave] before he could start.

I like some of the obscure comments.  For one thing, they remind me just
how much I owe Rob [literally -- do a "grep Roy *.h *.c" on the src directory
to find out how much].  In many cases, they explain why a particular
section of code looks so strange -- because "normal" code broke on one
(or more) of the many platforms.  Sure, I would *prefer* that the code had
better commenting, and the occasional "goto" causes my heart to skip a beat,
but then if I *really* cared about it, there was nothing stopping me
from producing a public patch.  And, when I couldn't figure something
out, Rob would ALWAYS answer my questions.

Collaborative software development is more a social process than an
engineering process -- your brash statements about the quality of the
NCSA httpd code is the social equivalent of a neophyte entering the
monastery for the first time and yelling for everyone to hear:

    "The New Testament makes for a pretty good story, but geez the
     writing is crap!  The grammar sucks, sentences run on and on,
     and the spelling looks like it was checked by an illiterate
     sheep-trainer!  Why, I've seen more divine inspiration in the
     arrangement of puke after a fraternal rush!

     So, would any of you like to help me rewrite it?"

Well, okay, so I'm exaggerating a bit -- nobody's been burned at the stake
for misinterpreting HTTP (yet).  Mind you, Rob has performed a few miracles
in his time, so I'd avoid getting on his bad side (just in case ;-).

You see, the fact is that you haven't EARNED the right to criticize that
code yet.  Rob (of course) has, Ari (CERN httpd) has, Marc (Mosaic) has,
and even I have (libwww-perl), but that's because we have already
contributed to it (or the WWW code in general). 

           THAT IS THE NATURE OF PUBLIC-DOMAIN CODE.

You are perfectly welcome to bewail the state of Microsoft code at any
time -- you paid for it.  The only way to "pay" for public-domain code is
to contribute toward its development.

Fix it first and make the result publicly available.  THEN you will have
the right to complain until you are blue in the mouth (or fingertips)
and we will all like you anyway (assuming you eventually stop).

Oh. This is *correct* C? I agree that moaning never solved
anything though... and he made an offer of a rewrite.

BTW. I do remember a very obscure bug in NCSA httpd. Something
about a pointer not being returned when it should be, but because
of the calling sequence, it would show it's face very rarely, and
cause a core dump.

Its the nature of code that tries to run on platforms developed by sadists

Well they don't send me source code very often. Perhaps a Microsoft bod
could send us some and we could all have a go.


If you want a pretty set of source code there is a very nice set of sources
for a daemon in LISP with specially commissioned comments by Umberto
Eco and J.D.Salinger, unfortunately you need a symbolics machine to
run it.

My model for USEnetII is a MUD in which you troll through various rooms

    UTF-8 - A special byte encoding that makes full 8 bit transfer over 7 
    bit  gateways safe.  Since HTTP is defined to be 8 bit clean, this is 
    not needed.

UTF-8 is based on FSS-UTF (File System Safe UTF ) developed at XOpen that 
is an 8-bit encoding of UCS-2.  My understanding this name has been registered
with the ECMA.  

The 7-bit encoding for UCS, I thought, was called UCS-8.  

The key is that FSS-UTF (UTF-8) is an 8-bit encoding that could be used
by HTTP.

    The HTTP protocol (since it is a protocol) will always be in Latin-1 
    using 8 bit characters (and hopefully this will move to a binary scheme).

Actually, from a "world wide" definition, HTTP will always be "portable
characters set" of Latin-1 (aka ASCII).

    A good solution for the multi-lingual problem would be to use Unicode 
    as the character encoding.  

I personally agree with this.

    Issues of left to right and right to left 
    text are simply resolved by the Unicode character code (no language or 
    locale information needed).  

Issues of directionality is not critical to this given that we've been
able to do Hebrew/Arabic using a single internatioanlized Motif.

    A document can contain any language at any 
    place in the document without special delimiters.  

I agree.

    The only limitation 
    is whether the browser has the font for the language and supports 
    non-left to right languages (which a real international browser should).

This is a sticky issue. I.e. we can not expect every client to be localized
the same as the server...

    To go along with this, I would suggest adding a new MIME type - 
    "text/uni-html" that indicates the document is using Unicode.   This 
    allows locations that don't need the extra information to not accept 
    unicode versions of the documents (saves on bandwidth).  This also 
    means that existing servers work and don't care they are serving up 
    Unicode docs.  The HTML definition doesn't change except a remark needs 
    to be added that if the document is a Unicode HTML document, then the 
    BOM will be the first two bytes of the document.

Again, I personally like this.  But with the addition that a non Uni-browser
should handle un-html and convert it to it's local national code set
and report any conversion errors in a meaningful way.

    I have been writing Unicode networking applications for many years and 
    I'm sold on it's simplicity and elegance.  There is simply no better 
    way to internationalize a product.  

Hummm, I know of a bunch of I18N folks that would disagree.  
But I'm easy and say it is just as simple as using standard I18N API's.

There's no need to take such a hostile tone in a public forum; although 
the NCSA code has many problems relating to performance, I found the code 
quite simple to understand. Remember that when this code was written, Rob 
was also a full time student. In those circumstances, the most important 
dimension to optimise for is time-to-implement- it's more important to 
make something work than to make it look pretty. Considering the amount 
of evolutionary changes that took place in HTTP, and all that 
interference from those Browser Weenies, the code is remarkably clear. 

If you want to see real pasta programming, take a look at the WAIS source 
code (only some of which I'm responsible for).

    This doesn't make sense to me, but then that may just be me.  The issues
    of localization and multilingualism are distinct.  The above paragraph,
    though, seems to combine them.

Yes and no.  Let me explain.  

First, I use "localization" to mean more then just translated messages.
For us we provide "locale packages" for fonts, input methods (including
dictionaries for multibyte languages), code conversions, keymaps, 
helps, on-line doc and translated messages.

Thus we provide a German locale that is based on Latin-1.  We also 
provide 50+ other locale packages that provide support for various 
languages / territories... based on their corresponding 
national code set.

In ADDITION, the UNIVERSAL locale is special because it is defined to 
take advantage of other locale packages.  E.g. the German locale and
Arabic locale packages would each bring in their respective fonts and
keyboard maps.  All  W. European locale packages share the same Latin
fonts.

The UNIVERSAL locale used what ever underlying locale packages are available.
Thus the level of multilingual support in the UNIVERSAL locale depends on
the set of local packages you install.

    Let me avoid abstraction by giving a concrete example.  Suppose we want
    a) a multilingual client and b) to use it in Germany.  To fulfull b, we
    might well localize for Germany.  Surely users will want all of the mes-
    sages to come up in German, and this is what i18n was designed to help
    designers do.  This, however, does *not* mean that users will only want
    to view German text via the Web.  Although their basic interface is in
    German, they might well stumble onto an important Bengali or Swahili
    information source, and want to read it.  The bottom line is that the
    user still wants the German localization.  But he or she nevertheless
    wants multilingual facilities as well.

Agree 100%.  

The set of locale packages we provide allow the users to choose what set
of facilities they desire.

    So to repeat, localization and multi-language interfaces are not incom-
    patible.  

I would agree.  Sorry if my earlier notes confused you.  

By now I hope you'll understand that we have actually integrated localization
and multi-lingual interfaces into one.  (Assumming you expand the definition
of localization to span more then just messages).

    Hence my confusion over why anyone would want to achive multi-
    lingualism by broadening localization to include a UNIVERSAL locale.
    Seems to be self-defeating.

Let me answer by saying that our desire is to make all internatioanlized
applications automatically multilingual via the UNIVESAL locale.  I.e.
the multilingual services (text processing, font, input) can be viewed 
differently from locale specific services (date/time/messages/...).     But
we view all pieces as part of the "localization" process.

I hope I've explained that using standard interfaces internatioanlized 
applications can achieve some level of multilingualism.  Our the goal 
has been to extend the internationalization interfaces to achieve 
multilingual from within te system across all applications 
  - mail, editors, help, print, etc..  
The UNIVERSAL locale is not just for application developers it makes
the entire system becomes multilingual.  

You should see vi with multi-lingual text.

I hopw this helps.

I'll half agree.  Part of the curious thing with free (and, for that
matter, commercial) software is that the squeaky wheel gets the
patching.  Many people will clamor for things like "better access
control" or "authentication support" or other random new flashy
features.  (Note:  In this article, I'm not thinking of NCSA's httpd,
or any other free software in particular.)

Relatively few people will clamor for things like "adherance to the
spec, including portions of it that do not necessarily have an
immediate impact on interoperability" or "code that I can read without
breaking down and crying."  So, quite understandably, some software
authors don't necessarily spend a lot of time worrying about such
issues; why waste time on something nobody cares about when your
mailbox is overflowing with things people do care about?

I think the code also demonstrates why things that look simple aren't
always good. As Roy points out, by last Spring I had found that the
whole thing had evolved through the factors Simon describes into
something unmanagable and I was about to re-architect the whole thing
when I got a little sidetracked... now I have a nice pile of managable
code but sorry, you can't read it :)

I'm now condemned to watch every few weeks as someone else figures out

science they'd hoped it to be and they jump to flap their yap on

fragments of my code held up to scare little children. Some people
would mail httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu about it first, which was good, and I
would always try to calm them down and then help them out. Most of

I can top that one. I once worked on a project which was over 25,000
lines of 65816 assembly code, which is 16-bit. The code was originally
written by Japanese programmers for the 32-bit 68000, and ported by a
person who was very enthusiastic, but was also very new to the whole
assembly scene and (to be polite) wasn't very good at it yet.

If there were ever any comments, they weren't likely to make any
sense. The original authors named modules in Japanese, with the
author's initial before the module name, so modules ended up being
called things like kbutai and ktensiset. Inside each module, there
were usually 20-30 subroutines, all of which did something subtly
different and often jumped into each other, all of which were named by
number, as in kbutai00 - kbutai19. Being assembly language, there were
a lot of branches and jumps within these functions which went to
labels that were parts of nested loops. Some of these loops were over
ten pages long. These labels would again not be named, but numbered.

*That* was a hearty plate of spaghetti. Weighing in at a little over
6,000 lines of C, I think NCSA httpd was more like Mac and Cheese.

I recently posted an offer to help rewrite the NCSA httpd if anyone was
interested in collaborating on such a project. 

The beginning of my posting was carelessly written, and unintentionally
offended several principles in the Web community. 

It has been brought to my attention that sections of a second posting
of mine, in response to one from mcom.com, also might have been written
in a way to make my point clearer.  My point was not that I'm a wizard
programmer and the NCSA httpd team is not, nor was my point that I'm a 
genius because I'm pursuing two degrees concurrently.  My point *was* 
that I'm not new to programming, nor am I unfamiliar with working under 
multiple and sometimes conflicting deadlines.  Just like everybody else. 

While I can't unsay what has been said, I certainly regret the hard 
feelings my words may have caused.  I'd like to take responsibility for my 
inappropriate choice of words, and apologize for any harm done by them.

I'd like to thank the folks who responded to my postings--both those
who were supportive, and those who were ...less than supportive. ;) 

I'd also like to drop this matter now! 

Sincerely,

This isn't all that different from the "capability" architectures I
used back when I was building provably (I can't spell!) secure
operating systems and network.  (Yes, we were doing formal
verification of OS designs and protocols against a formal security
model.  I designed and built the first B level secure OS and was
working on the first A level secure one.)

Capabilities are essentially unforgeable certificates to use a
resource.  What is really nice about them is that they allow a request
to be handled through a chain of distinct protection domains.  Unlike
Unix setuid, in which the privileges are somewhat cascaded and added
(at least to one level), capability passing allows each domain to
explicitly express what privilege is to be passed to another domain.
In other words, the trust one puts into a domain of execution is only
that that domain does not abuse those privileges expressly passed to
it or those which it itself owns.

It's not an easy mechanism to build, especially when the capability
objects must cross over a network.

Capabilities/certificates make it easier to determine whether one
will trust a piece of software, but it is still necessary to determine
whether to trust it or not.

And to me that is the crux of the issue: Safe environments are
designed to so limit a program that whatever it does is ok, even if
that program is generated by a random (or even an "evil") code writer
program.  In other words, no trust is necessary.

But I think that, in networks of information especially, it will be
valuable to have programs that can aggregate and manipulate
inforamation bases in the non-bounded WWW space.  And I have a feeling
that this will require trusted programs rather than confined programs.

On the other hand, I'm not about to give automatic trust to something
that arrives in my machine and says "execute me."

    >Issues of directionality is not critical to this given that we've been
    >able to do Hebrew/Arabic using a single internatioanlized Motif.

    Could you describe this implementation in more detail?  

Basically, the Motif Text widget has been modified to use a set of 
services we call "Layout Services".  These services provide transformations
of text based on a set of layout values, e.g. orientation, typeOfText,
symmetric swapping, numeric, shapingcharset and others.   The 
transformation actually provide the ability to convert between implicit 
data into visual data.  There is some support for some explicit controls 
as well.  All of the layout services are used internal to Motif such
that internationalized applications  are not aware of these transformation.

The Text widget  does provide resources that allow the user to control
some of the layout values, e.g. orientation, swapping and numeric.

Every locale includes it's own layout object that defines its behavior.
Thus the layout services work with every locale but only perform 
re-ordering transformations when executing under the Hebrew/Arabic locales.
We've not done every locale as of yet.

We have proposed the Layout Services to the XOpen and Uniform Joing
Internationalization Working Group and they have been discussing the
proposal.   It has been changed somewhat from the AIX version but
is basically the same.  I understand it will be going into company review 
this month.

    I've never heard
    of a client that correctly handled bidirectional wordwrap.

To be honest, the word support in Motif if non-existent.  Basically, all
it provides is line wrap based on spaces.  Yet, in the Hebrew/Arabic
locales it does do this based on the visual space instead of the 
implicit state.

Also as long as I'm giving more details... the layout services has
only been done using the national code sets of Hebrew/Arabic - ISO88859-6,8
and PC code sets IBM-856/IBM-1046.

Hi,

I am trying to write  a www browser, but need pointers to where  to

WWWLibrary.tar.Z, but how can use that? Should I just browse through the
source code?
The browser I am trying to write  is supposed to handel another language
which is written Right->Left.
Is there any source code for browsers where I can start, preferably
on Windows?
Are there any documentation on the subject?

There is another, related issue. We on the list (myself included) are treating 
it as a new problem to be solved. From our perspective, it is. But of course 
people in Russia and China and Saudi Arabia etc already have computers, already 
create documents in their native languages, so any different, incompatible way 
of doing the same thing is not going to be welcomed. People need to be able to 
prepare text using their existing editors and wordprocessors and just add some 
markup to say how it is encoded.

Absolutely.  The approach we took in Safe-Tcl was to have a core set of
capabilities that was available to untrusted users, and then have simple
ways to extend that capability differentially for particular trusted
users.  

The hooks for doing this have been in Safe-Tcl all along.  Only this
weekend, I finally implemented the small amount of necessary glue that
makes it easy to give Safe-Tcl programs particular extended capabilities
based on PGP signatures.  (For those interested, I sent a preliminary
version of how to do this to the safe-tcl list the day before
yesterday.)  Thus you can say that safe-tcl programs from a certain set
of PGP-signed senders have read or write access to a certain subset of
your files. 

I think that an extensible "safe" environment is the right platform on
which to build differentially more powerful environments for trusted
colleagues.  I think that a binary trusted/untrusted distinction is not
rich enough -- you need to be able to support shared files, for example,
without sharing ALL your files....  -- Nathaniel

        And I think  [the light goes on slowly for me]  that you're
advocating a generic extension.   Right?   Not bound to a particular
language?

        The thing about CGI scripts is that they're under control of
the server's sysadmin or (better sometimes) the data maintainer(s).
In either case,  the language(s) locally available are known and/or
can be acquired and installed.   CGI isn't Perl  (thankfully).

        What worries me,  if we are in fact talking about the
general case,  is that a client might try to get a server on,  say,
a VAX to run a script written in,  say,  REXX.   It ain't gonna fly.

Gary Adams quotes Lilia Carol Scott:

 <blockquote>
 ...  In recent years many UNIX programmers have turned
 to VHLLs for rapid prototypes and complete applications.
 They take advantage of these languages' higher level of abstraction
 to complete projects more rapidly and easily than they could
 with lower level languages.
 </blockquote>

        Indeed!   Hear here:  "rapid prototyping".   Bravo!
Actually,  VHLLs are applicable to full-blown applications as well.
For example:  Richard Schafer's  MAILBOOK,  which is entirely written
in REXX with perhaps one or two lower-level shims.

 <blockquote>
 While VHLLs such as TCL, Perl, Icon, and REXX have gained
 widespread use and popularity,    ...
 </blockquote>

        All four of which qualify as  "CGI scripting languages".
(I'm winging it with Icon;  can it in fact access environment vars?
seems like a safe bet)

Agreed.  And I would like to go further -- in some contexts there are
requirements that after a program has touched a certain class of file
it is henceforth not allowed to write into another class of file.
I.e. the program isn't going to be allowed to reclassify sensitive
data from one level to another.

This is a fairly dynamic kind of safe environment, where the access
rights depend on the sequence of previous actions.

(This kind of thing may reflect my work with governmental and military
based security policies and may be too much for commercial use.
However, I would submit for discussion, that there may be need for
this kind of flexibility.)

Makes sense.  I don't think it would be hard to implement in the current
Safe-Tcl, either -- the extension environment is pretty much arbitrarily
powerful, so policies like this can be implemented by the extension
writer.  The trickiest part would be if there were multiple
independently-developed extensions, in which case they might need a
shared mechanism for making note of what kinds of capabilities had been
previously used.  But one extension writer can do all this easily enough
for a set of related capabilities.   Is that good enough, do you think,
or do we need a standardized interface by which multiple
*independently-implemented* extensions can inform each other about
whether or not they've been used?  -- Nathaniel

Right.  I can't even remember scheme/lisp long enough to read a
program, much less write one.  :-) The only reason I even brought up
scheme was to illustrate that there are alternatives to TCL.  (I *am*
using scheme in other contexts, but not for code I expect humans to
write.)

I really like the saying "everything in computer science can be fixed
by adding another level of indirection."  Of which I find "late
binding" to be a corrolary.

Having hooks where one can hang a complete program language seems to
me to be a way of adding indirection and late binding.

We see this in CGI scripts, where the script itself performs the binding
between the URL and the content that is delivered over http to the client.

I'd like to see a generalized execution environment for me, as a
client, to run sophisticated, perhaps long lived, queries.  I can do
it as a client, but it involves polling using http.  I'd rather make
it more efficient.

The trouble with CGI, however, is that it tends to require the
sysadmin to anticipate all ways that I, as a client, might want to
search or aggregate or summarize the document space offered by the
server (or the other servers I can reach.)

Nah.  I've been thinking of IBM MVS JCL as the script language, perhaps
with RPG or APL extensions.  ;-)

Answering my own question -- I just remembered the stink when people
found out that Prodigy was snapshotting part of their computer's
memory and sending it back to the Sears/IBM servers.

Thus for example, I can conceive of a "safe" execution restriction
that says that once a script has read something from one of my local
files, it can no longer emit network traffic.

I can speak with some authority on the subject of NCSA HTTPD 1.3 as well.
I "adapted" it to the Windows 16-bit and  32-bit environments. It took
a lot of work, and Rob was there for me when I needed it. I did spend 
a lot of time working through the code before embarking on what turned out
to be a mostly rewrite. I wouldn't call that code "maintainable", but then
I wouldn't say too much about it being "bad" either. My only real complaint
was that it depended on the Unix semantics of forking children and letting
the process termination clean up all the memory allocations. Because I
had the goal of making the code multi-threaded (even on 16-bit Windows),
I also had to collect all of the global per-request data into a big struct 
and pass its pointer around all over the place.

Anyway, it is what it is, and it does the job well for loads of people.

For my part: Rob, thanks.

Daniel, et al,

First and foremost, I applaud your interest in getting remotely executable
data objects into the Web.  Since Tim Standish made the original suggestion
for "active messaging" in 1970, the idea of sending off useful snippets of
code has been tantalizing, but reserved for the research world.  We are
finally starting to see it show up in real-world scenarios.

Having said that, I'd like to encourage folks to think carefully about the
real requirements and especially hard about the hard parts.  My own belief
is that universality and safety are the to major requirements.  The latter
is particularly difficult.

"Efficiency" of execution is not irrelevant, but likely to be far less
critical for most applications than most of us tend to think.  Why is that?
Well, most of what is likely to be done is not intensive distributed
system computation.  It is likely to be simple transactions.  The mobile
code acts as an agent for the originator and it interacts with the remote
system to get and give some data.

The lesson on the Internet is that the best way to achieve universality
(i.e., an infrastructure with large-scale interoperability) is by keeping
things simple and uniform, particularly seeking to make the incremental
function known only to the end-points that are participating and not
require any changes to the connectivity infrastructure.

The best way to achieve safety is to have a limited core set of
capabilities and then provide very careful interfaces to required services.
(The user interface concern that Nathaniel expressed clearly is important,
but I believe that it frankly is secondary to the technical constraints on
resource access.  But then, I don't trust users to pay close attention even
to well-done queries from their software...)

Safe-TCL was designed to satisfy these requirements.  Peculiarities of
programming in TCL notwithstanding, it is a simple language and the
interpreter can run on any platform easily.  (TK is less trivial, but is
proving also to be  portable.)  Safe-TCL carefully crippled TCL, to make it
safe, and then provides access to interfaces for "modules" of specialized
service.  I believe that the details of the chosen language are not all
that critical, since it only needs to be reasonable, not "intuitive" or
otherwise perfect.  End-users are not going to be the typical programmers
for these agents.

Few such modules have been developed, yet, so that the real work is to
start exploring extension to Safe-TCL, defining generic modules (e.g.,
calendar schedule is a personal favorite; workflow management might be
another; how about simple product purchasing?...)  This leaves a repertoire
of "virtual services" at each participant's site.  Then we can develop
different kinds of mobile agents to interact.  My distributed meeting
scheduler might move around and conduct scheduling in one way; yours might
do it differently.  Both would interact with the remote sites through the
same 'calendar' interface.  (The concern for 'efficiency' gets addressed by
the implementation of the interface primitives on the remote site.  They
are, in effect, the instructions to the virtual machine for the specialzed
service.)

In other words, let's try not to make the major part of the effort be
definition and implementation of the platform.  I fear that work on a
highly general, virtual 'machine' environment would result in such a
distraction.  Instead, let's use the considerable effort that has been put
into Safe-TCL and build on it, creating some useful Internet services.

d/

p.s. this should not be restricted to the Web.  The same sorts of things
should be available through email.  Most of the world doesn't have high
speed web access, remember.

We have been looking into this over the past few days, UTF basiaclly overcomes 
whinges about UNICODE doubling storage space. It is simply another content
encoding to deal with.

We are not looking at a scheme whereby tokens from the SGML parser are
converted internally into a 32 bit code, mapping this onto UNICODE. Thus
the &wazoo; nonsense can be dealt with by the lexical analyser. Imagine now
a feedback from the SGML parser proper to cause context switches of the 
code converter, using such a scheme it is even possible to change encoding
in mid stream (usefull for handling JIS escapes).

A charset module can easilly be written to convert fairly arbitrary encodings
into UNICODE tokens. This can also do UTS, ASCII, ISO-8893, JIS, and whacky
Russian etc. encodings.

On the other side I am looking into a scheme of `multifonts' which allows 
several X11 fonts to be compounded into a single UNICODE mapping. Because the
display module is directly engaged we can translate into the target font
character by character. This scheme means that the UNICODE stuff does not cause 
increased internal storage requirements.

Because ASCII maps into the lower 8 bits of UNICODE anyway there is no speed
penalty for straight ASCII. Other forms are similarly efficient. The only problem
is when fonts map to overlapping parts of the encoding space.


So the content type is

text/html 			(default to ISO-8893-1)
text/html; charset=UNICODE
text/html; charset=UTF
text/html; charset=ISO..
text/html; charset=JIS
etc.

This is nice because we can then reuse the display module for text/plain.

For X11 this is a real pain because of the way fonts are handled. It is not 
very easy to load up application specific fonts. Otherwise we could use URLs 
as the transport mechanism.

We are currently using the standard X11 font distribution, MIT have free
fonts for Korean, Chinese and Japanese. There are several Hebrew ones. I have
metafont for hieroglyphs which I would like to have in X11 but the SeeTeX
stuff will not compile on my machine.


Anyone got a URL for UNICODE???

It is not at all clear to me that Safe-Tcl provides access to
interfaces to modules. How does one introduce an interface into the
Safe-Tcl system?  By adding to the Safe-Tcl implementations on each
host where my computations will run, I gather. What if my program
uses two independently-developed extension interfaces? How do I build
a Safe-Tcl interpreter with _both_ extensions built in?

This is a solved problem for python, for example. I might argue that
it is as much work to address the modules problem in Tcl as it is to
make python safe.

I also suspect that very soon we will discover that these little agent
programs need to conduct dialogs with multiple parties at the same
time: they need to talk not just with the user, but also with other
agents and network entities. Hence suspect that threads will be an
invaluable part of the runtime system for distributed agents.

Threads are no picnic in python (and I've never seen any work on
multi-threaded Tcl apps...) but the scheme48 virtual machine supports
them. I think it's worth studying carfully.

I agree that a lot of ground has been covered in the Safe-Tcl work,
and that we should not throw it away lightly.

But I also believe that building useful Internet services involves
significant complexity management, and that complexity management is a
particular weakness of Tcl. Sure, the implementation of Safe-Tcl is
clean and somewhat simple, but at the cost of complexity of programs
built on that platform.

The point of this thread is to consider whether a more fine-grain
platform would lead to a system that can be implemented in a
straightforward fashion without hampering the ability to build large
systems using sophisticated languages to manage the complexity.

You're not the first to argue that universality is a requirement of
this system, and I'm not the first one to suggest that a world built
on top of Tcl will be unmanageable.

I can give a specific example of the value of a scripting language in
a document.  Back in the mid-70's I helped develop a modeling language
in which formulas would contain what we then called a "reference function".
The reference would specify data elements to be used in the
current formula.  A reference would consist of location:context:
table:row spec:column spec.  Each formula containing table was
patterned after the green spreadsheets that economists are fond of.
(Yes, I really blew the marketing of this one.)  We might have a table
entry like:
INCOME FROM SALES | (tab=Production:rows=US:cols=1974)times trend(loc=
		FedReserve:tab=GNP:rows=Consumer Products:cols=1965-1973)

Each table could reference other tables the current system or
(depending on who won the fight with the sysadmins) other systems. (Not
much was networked back then.)  The reference function assumed the value
of the referenced object.  The syntax was much different but I think the
example captures what we were doing.  This system was used in creating
economic and financial models and the economists, lawyers and financial
planners loved it (because they could read the code that executed).
 
I've been thinking about how to change the system to take advantage of
web technology.  So far I've resisted the temptation to do it using the
scripting language we used then, which was - see below...

You got it, APL!!!

There is real value in a good scripting language and I've watched this
discussion closely.  Only other thing I might add at this time is that
it might be reasonable to restrict the language so that it can only 
modify the currently active document space.

I agree with Karl:

> files, it can no longer emit network traffic.

To offer another scenario:

Suppose I'm running some kind of for-pay service.  I am interested in
attracting new business, so I want to encourage people to try my
server. But you don't want to be obligated to pay if the service is no
good (you run a long query and discover my server has nothing
relevant) yet I don't want to give answers away for free.

We can get part way there just by having common standards for posting
rates, terms and conditions.  (By analogy with a restaurant, that's
like posting the menu to a restaurant outside the door.  Of course it
doesn't tell you whether the food is good, but at least you know the
price and whether they take checks.)

But might there not be cases where you actually have to run a job or
make a query to tell whether the service is what you want?  In that
case, I might want to allow you to send an agent (program) to my
server where it can execute, but all it's allowed to send back to you
is one bit, which tells you whether you ought to buy in.
Does this scenario make sense?

Safety, by the way, should not require reading the source code.

Two reasons for this.

1) I want to protect the privacy of my agents.  They may embody
private or proprietary material.  For example, my negotiating
position.   Imagine walking into the bargaining room where the
other side has been allowed to xray your briefcase.

2) Security should not be require that you understand the code to be
executed ("Even though it does contain a call to rm ** it's in
a branch that can never be reached...") because you can be wrong.

Does safe-tcl (or any alternative) have either of these properties?  I
suspect not, for the first, and yes for the second.

I find this sort of information *from servers* to be extremely
useful.

In addition, one thing I've been cogitating on is how to express
copyright restrictions/licensing terms/payment agent information in a
way that a user's automated browser can read *before* fetching the
entire document (i.e. using a HEAD request).  Making copyright
comprehensible to a *program* (especially in my self-imposed limit of
400 bytes, max) is a bit of a challenge.  (But I have some ideas which
I will post later this month after they I get a chance to bounce them
off some lawyers better educated in this area than I am.)

Don't confuse the Mac's OS with Motif.  Sure the Mac has multilingual
facilities (WorldScript), but very few software packages for the Mac
actually take advantage of them.  For example, Microsoft has stated
that they have no plans to enhance Word with WorldScript technology,
and that they intend to stick with the localization model.  So just
because the Mac has multilingual facilities doesn't mean that soft-
ware (like Word or Motif)is necessarily multilingual as well.

It's also worth nothing that you have to buy modules for all of those
extra languages on the Mac, so it's not like we can just plug and
play.

Still, you're right that the people at Apple have thought these is-
used through and resolved some of them - years ahead of most other
major vendors.  Just look at Windows struggling; Unix is positively
pathetic.  Not to say that Unix is pathetic in other respects.  It
it the programming environment of choice for anyone who knows what
he or she is doing (and plans on doing it in English :-)).

    It is simply another content encoding to deal with.

    A charset module can easilly be written to convert fairly arbitrary encodings
    into UNICODE tokens. This can also do UTS, ASCII, ISO-8893, JIS, and whacky
    Russian etc. encodings.

I'm not sure I follow... excuse me if I missed the point ... but it sounds like
you are suggesting we put "ANY ENCODING" in the document and have each viewer
convert into UNICODE... 

If so, this will cause MAJOR interoperability problems across the network.  
Expecting every client to be convert to from every possible encoding will never 
work - consider Latin-1 has :  PC 437, PC 850, EBCDIC, ISO8859, UTF, UCS, 
other PC national code pages...

Rather, the document should be supplied in a canonical encoding, i.e. UCS, 
that each client should just provide 1 conversion at the max.  

    On the other side I am looking into a scheme of `multifonts' which allows 
    several X11 fonts to be compounded into a single UNICODE mapping. 

If this is so, then storing them with UNICODE makes more sense since such
fonts will exist... and there is no conversion at view time.

    Because the
    display module is directly engaged we can translate into the target font
    character by character. This scheme means that the UNICODE stuff does not cause 
    increased internal storage requirements.

But this causes a nightmare for system administrators that need to provide 
conversions from any other encoding to UNICODE... and puts the burden of 
conversion on the clients each time the document is accessed rather then on the 
supplier one time.

I fully realize we can't convert over to a single canonical form overnight.
But we should provide the convention that re-enforce simple administration
and enhance interoperability for all systems.

    So the content type is

    text/html                   (default to ISO-8893-1)
    text/html; charset=UNICODE
    text/html; charset=UTF
    text/html; charset=ISO..
    text/html; charset=JIS
    etc.

Here is a proposal that would help to converge on a uniform 
canonical encoding....

    text/html; charset=charset_name

where

charset_name            := UCS2_ID'_'UCS_plane 
                           | DCE_ID'_'DCE_encoding
                           | private_encoding

UCS2_ID                 := 'UCS2'

UCS_plane               := '0x'<4_hexdigits>

DCE_ID                  := 'DCE'

DCE_encoding            := '0x'<8_hexdigits>

private_encoding        := portable character string

For UCS2_ID, the characters will be encoded using 1 byte values corresponding to it's 
UCS_plane within UCS-2.   The value of any given character can be combined with the 
UCS_plane value to obtain an UNICODE value.  For example, UCS2_0x0000 is Latin-1!
For CJK, the DCE_ID of UCS-2 is recommended (see below).

For any DCE value, the characters will be encoded using the encoding registry
developed for DCE.  Refer to DCE RFA 41.1 and the X/Open Federated Naming 
Specification.  The latter relies on the DCE encoding registry
to tag names of different encodings.  The nice thing is that the DCE
registry includes UCS-2 as one of the encodings...
for example the UCS-2 level 3 DCE registered value is: charset=DCE_0x00010102

Frank

PS. I really don't like the use of hexdigits in the names but it is more 
precise...

Speaking of Hieroglyphs, this is one of those areas where Unicode just
isn't done yet.  We could likewise argue for centuries over how to han-
dle the Sumerian-Akkadian-Assyrian-Babylonian script(s).  There is sim-
ply no way that Unicode is ever going to be a complete solution.  Be-
ing a philologist by training, I can only look with horror on the idea
of locking everyone into an internal Unicode representation scheme.

I've seen suggestions that seem to me as though they amount to this.
Am I misunderstanding?  Phil, Dan, anyone else - ?

With regard to using Unicode as an interchange format:

Let me get this straight -- one can only post articles to the group after
having posted some good articles to the group?  You read Catch-22 twice,
I'm guessing... ;-)

Ah, the truth emerges.  Does a HyperCard prototype count?

But somewhat more seriously, those of us in the agent business should
probably be investing more R&D into a new kind of automatic characterizing:
identification of advertisements, flames and other situationally
objectionable dreck.  That way, you could set your own rules for who can
virtually post a flame, or ad, or whatever.

Old idea, new wrinkle.

You may be talking about what I've heard called the "Han
unification controversy."  In brief, some Japanese char-
acters are historically Chinese characters.  The thought
was that if they are historically the same they could be
coded identically.  Same controversy could be repeated
for many other scripts.

Fascinating, but tangential, tidbit:  The Phoenician
script gave rise to Hebrew and Aramaic script, which
gave rise, in large part, to Arabic script.  Phoenician
also served as the basis for Greek, which influenced
Latin, which is the basis for all "western" scripts.
So, for example, our letter A is directly related to
the Hebrew letter aleph.  And, when you get right down
to it, this letter itself gmay go all the way back to 
the Sumerian sign GUD, which is a logogram for "bull."

I propose that we use the same code for the Akkadian-
Sumerian sign as for Hebrew aleph, Arabic alif, Greek
alpha, and Latin A.  They are all the same sign, after
all - historically.

It is just this sort of dispute that should tip us off
to what I've been talking about here a lot, namely that
Unicode isn't a cure-all.  There needs to be leeway for
other systems - past, present, and future.  Scripts are
a field unto themselves, and a bunch of engineers can't
be entrusted with its intricacies any more than you
guys should trust a bunch of typographers and non-CS
visionaries to design a tractable markup metalanguage
:-).

And I want scripts I can send to a server to perform various search

It would be nice if the language (or set of languages) were the same,
although there might be a different set of base primitives.

One problem I see with the safe virtual machine approach can be
seen if you look at an existing example: 
 Some of the Macintosh virus protection programs do something
quite similar: they sit there and intercept system calls and 
warn you that a program is trying to modify a file in the system
folder. You can then refuse, allow or "learn" ( an allow that will
be marked to allow again in the future. ) 
  The problem is that, since the Mac was not designed with security 
in mind, it's usually not obvious to a typical user whether these 
are legitimate accesses or not. About half of the users I see, 
panic when they see these messages and the other half just allow
*everything* or turn off the facility. 

  The security mechanisms have to be sufficiently higher order
to be useful. 

  My reservations concerning safe-tcl are that:
(1) It provides some of these higher-order safety features. 
(2) It's missing others that may be required. -- Well - that's
not a problem. It's a programming language, so you can implement
the unexpected requirements that Nathaniel is worried you won't 
capture in a more declarative non-procedural language.
(3) That extensional capability is the loophole: how can you
ensure that the higher-order access functions are used, and not
some lower level disguised approach. ( Not disguised to the
safe-tcl mechanism, but disguised to the user - i.e. will they
understand the warning. )
(4) safe-tcl can be incrementally extended to provide new higher-
level facilities, while restricting low level access, but this 
leads to a versioning problem. 

These problems may not be fatal. But think the security requirements 
for enabled-mail, server-agents, and client-executed browser code
are all rather different, so a fatal flaw in one realm may be only
a minor annoyance in another. In some cases you can get away with
the conservative approach of rejecting anything that even looks 
suspicious. In others, you will punt the decision to the user
with an Allow/Deny query. 

  In some of the distributed programming safety features I want
to get into Python, for example, I have a looser requirement. 
That the program not do things it "claims" not to do: If it
imports no I/O capable module, then it doesn't do any I/O. If
it requires to communicate over a socket to another program, 
then I can hand it an already opened socket, or an object 
that represents a potential socket or inactive "future". 

  I'm trying for something that is halfway between the safe-tcl
model, and the more capability based model of Obliq. It's not
just a question of language syntax (I think), but of a very 
different security model. I don't think Obliq could be made to
provide safe-tcl like enabled mail, but I think it may be a 
better model for the types of client server interaction we're
considering on the Web.

Obliq does provide the first, but it does because it doesn't ship
functions around - it's more of a RPC system. It would thus involve
moving a lot more data around, which is why I didn't think it was 
a solution for Web distributed programming. 

 In fact, I don't see how you can possibly have #1, if you are
shipping functions around, although you can make it more difficult
by not shipping SOURCE code around. ( If it's encoded, you have to
give them the key! ) 

( BTW: Python's import statement will handle either python source
code or complied byte code, but there *IS* an existing python 
byte-code decompiler in the standard library. ) 

You would have to keep proprietary parts of your agent on *your*
machine, and have it communicate over a socket to the "public"
part. This requirement clearly conflicts with some other desires 
to make exactly that impossible, that have been mentioned in this
thread. Which leads me to again believe that this is a great and
fun area for research, but not quite ready for prime-time standardization.

Whether we are talking about a virtual machine, or a language,
the problem seems to be that some larger functionality - either
a built-in function, or a system-call, has to be standardized.

Given a list of those higher-level capabilities, the question 
of language syntax is pretty trivial. A minimal syntax would 
make sense - it could be scheme, tcl, or even an <SGML>-ish
representation. ( After reading the paper on TC - a tcl compiler,
I considered trying to compile tcl source into python byte code -
it looks like it would map pretty well. However, at the time, 
I was advised that doing that wouldn't get me very far without
all of the other functionality of Tk and other external libraries.
Now that Tk has been ported to Python, I may reconsider. ) 

Nathaniel has incorporated a number of email-centric functions 
into safe-tcl. I don't think we've identified a similar set 
for Web applications and agents.

Yes, internally as part of the parser. There has to be some sort of uniform
encoding and chosing UNICODE makes sense.

I was not planning to support EBCDIC. But The ISO encodings, ISO8859 and the
UNICODE ones are ok. The ISO8859 encodings are in any case part of the MIME
spec. 

There are no interoperability problems, if a client cannot accept an encoding
it should not send an accept line for it. There are however a number of
optimisations possible such as requiring UNICODE browsers to support certain
stream encodings as well. But this is simply a matter of specification.

This is not currently possible without operator intervention, the X11 font
scheme requires the fonts to be loaded onto the server. We cannot guarantee
that a font will be avaliable. Sysops most often have a three week or so
delay between being asked to do something and it happening. The low sysop
intervention required is a major reason for web growth.

If anyone has a UNICODE font for X11 we would like it. However we have to
allow people to use the fonts they chose.

It has no implications for the system manager, it is an internal conversion
transparent to everyone. X11 and postscript fonts have encoding vector
descriptors. In the case of X11 a set of heuristics is required to obtain
it from the font name. In any case it is a user setup feature. Providing
defaults for the standard X11 fonts is sufficient for now. If people want
to use non standard font encodings then they will have to do work, but
that is inevitable. The hieroglyph poeple would prefer that to not being able
to use a font at all.

We will never have a canonical form, the idea is completely antithical to the
web. The whole principle is that the clients and servers should adapt to
support established standards and be adaptable to support arbitrary standards.

Well we have 32 bits to play with not just 16 so there should be plenty of
space to map in extra sets. Alternatively we could divide up the application
specific area. Hieroglyphs are meant to be included. We could make a 
good guess at the Gardner list being used as the basis for the encoding and
work on that basis. The best bet in that case would be to use an ascii
encoding and SGML entities and make the mapping part internal to the browser.
That way there would be no later incompatibility issues. When UNICODE was
completed all that would have to change would be changing the entity
definitions.

Just to repeat. We only have one character at a time in 32 bit form, it
is analysed in the context of the current multifont and font to see if a
font change within the multifont is required. The character is then mapped
to the encoding scheme of the font.


Issues such as the Han unification controversy (which sounds like the name
of a novel) are inevitable if you only have 16 bits. The point is though
that SGML is not really any use in defining entity sets. The standard
entity set def being :-

<!ENTITY aacute SDATA "[aacute]" -- Now just how do you intend to print it?-->


To make a browser work interoperably we need a REAL, IE ACTUALLY USEFULL
definition of the entity. The only one that is of use is to define within
the context of a character set. UNICODE may not be a complete model but it is
at least a reasonably large one. We can bite off chunks of the 32 bit space
for extended usage and novel stuff.

The alternative seems to be to force everyone to write all their documents in 
unicode, which would give a large increas in server disk space and transfer time 
at a stroke.

As I said yesterday, people in other countries already have methods for encoding 
the characters of their national languages, and these methods should be 
supported.

Put youself in other's shoes - how would you feel if the Web technology was all 
Japanese, say, and the instructions said something like:

 " To type a letter 'e', use shift control right bracket kanji-something. 
  On keyboards without a kanji-something, refer to your manufacturers
  instructions. Pressing the letter 'e' on your keyboard will not work."

> If so, this will cause MAJOR interoperability problems across the network. 

Why? Why would this cause more severe problems than forcing everyone to use 
Unicode when authoring documents?

[Is that "to be able to convert" ?]

Sure it will. We *are* using a common libwww aren't we?

I appreciate what you are saying, but the picture is not entirely as you present 
it for two reasons.

Firstly, not all clients will need to convert. Realistically, many of the 
documents using a particular encoding will be read by people also using that 
encoding. So, converting to Unicode on the server would impose a burden of two 
encodings - to and from the same native encoding that the people are using in a 
particular country.

Secondly, the phrase "system administrators" rings warning bells here. Your 
mental model seems to be of a technical support team running a server, doing 
code conversion on all their documents to a common format, etc. This is the 
traditional heavyweight publishing model. 

Fine, some servers are like that but not all. Remember that the first Web 
browser for the NeXT was also an editor, and remember Tim BL's address at WWW94 
describing how important it was that the Web encouraged collaborative, 
lightweight publishing. The readers are also the writers. So putting a burden on 
the 'supplier' is the same thing as putting a burden on the consumer.

It strikes me that an alternative reading of what you wrote would mean the 
'system administrators' are the people who install the clients. If that is what 
you mean, then clients using a common code library would use that for the 
conversions, so sysadmins would not, individually, have to solve the problem.

        I find the need for another variable in the CGI spec.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding what's already there.   Maybe someone could
help me?   Maybe CGI really needs to be improved.   What do y'all think?

        I don't see a variable for that  "extra info"  that comes
after the script name in some cases.   For example,  imagemap has to
have some reference to which map to use.   Now I've argued that we
should use something other than a slash to delimit the "extra" from
the path to imagemap,  but it doesn't matter.   As long as the server
knows what to do,  it can isolate the "extra" and stash it in an
environment variable.   So ... what do we call that variable?

        I'm thinking  PATH_EXTRA.   This is to compliment  PATH_INFO,
PATH_TRANSLATED,  and  SCRIPT_NAME,  none of which  (I think)  do what
I'm looking for.   I suppose we could have the scripts parse  PATH_INFO,
but isn't this something that the server should do?

        Most servers send something like

            Server: server/version library/version

        Right?   (I think that's how the spec reads)

        What if there isn't a separate  "library"?   Or what if there
are several  "library"  identifiers?   Let me show you what I'm working
with.   For the VM server,  there are perhaps three or four supporint

            Server: CMSHTTPD/1.2 REXX/4.0 Pipes/2.0201 Sockets/2.01 CMS/10.402

        What should I do?   A recent thread suggests that the above is
quite un-kosher.   But to be honest,  everything there is relevant
and useful for debugging  (at least)  or demographics.   Alternatively,
I could list just the server level,  because there is no REXX WWW Library.

Safe-Tcl has a distributed library feature that allows a user or a site
to decide to trust a library of extensions on the Internet.  Adding a
"module" to such a library effectively extends the functionality of
Safe-Tcl for ALL sites that trust that library. 

The big remaining problem with this scheme is of course scope of naming.
 It is my personal hope that some way to limit the scope of names to
module boundaries will be added to Tcl eventually.

Do you really want a language that will only work on machines that
support threads?

I think you may have missed a key point that Dave made.  We undoubtedly
want very complex CSCW applications on the network.  But the part of
such systems that has to be executed in a safe language is VERY limited.
 In particular, you only need to use Safe-Tcl for what I call "RPC to
human beings".  Most of your work can go on inside trusted servers on
the net, programmed in any language you like.  The role of Safe-*
languages is much more limited -- it needs to be able to go off and
interact with the user on his/her platform, but it needn't contain the
whole application.  I think you overestimate the need for very large
programs in the safe language.  However, I also agree that Tcl needs
better support for modules.

You're exactly right -- no to 1, yes to 2.  I have not thought of any
good way to accomplish #1, and would be interested in suggestions.  I'm
skeptical about the possibility of a solution using  encryption,
however.  One possibility would be to add a primitive for real-time
communication with the trusted server, but this is a tricky thing to
make safe AND it limits the application to IP-connected recipients.

This is actually precisely the point I was trying to make in my "note to
potential implementors".  The warning code needs to be implemented
*inside* the primitives, at a level of abstraction where the requested
action can be explained at a user-comprehensible level.  Users
understand questions like "Can this program send mail to
president@whitehouse.gov" or "Can this program print 30 pages", and
that's the kind of level where the question has to be asked.

It does indeed lead to a versioning problem IF the extensions are done
in the core language interpreter, but NOT if the above-mentioned
distributed library facilities are used, which is my preferred method
for extending the system.

While I can certainly imagine that this might prove to be the case, I
have not yet seen any evidence for it.  I've been watching fairly
carefully, and will certainly continue to do so.

Well, I'm not sure this is a useful level of abstraction for user
confirmations, etc. -- the same problem you just alluded to.  There are
plenty of programs I might let open up a socket to a telnet port, but
not necessarily to the sendmail port at whitehouse.gov.

Actually, there aren't as many email-centric functions as it appears at
first glance, but some of them are (I now think) poorly named.  There
are a lot of MIME-related functions, but of course these are useful in
some non-mail contexts (including the Web).  There are some
mail-specific primitives for parsing headers and for sending mail.  The
latter is essential, the former is really just a speedup (over doing all
the parsing in Tcl; remember that the Tcl philosophy is generally to put
compute-intensive functions inside primitives written in C). 

My guess is that there will be a few such functions that are
particularly desirable for the Web -- possibly doing some HTML
construction/deconstruction, reading HTML into a Tk text widget, opening
an HTTP connection, that sort of thing.  I agree that this is a vital
area for Web-related discussions about safe environments -- probably a
lot more vital than the issue of choosing a language syntax!  --

For multi-font technology, have a look at plan 9.  I faced
a similar design issue when I designed MADO (a windowing system I'm
writing for VSTa). What I decided to do was to have a "map"
which maps ranges of characters from a font onto ranges of unicode codes.
This mapping can be specified at the user, and the system level,
and by taking locales into account, most han unification like
problems become a nuisance rather than a stumbling block.

Unicode isn't perfect, but it's a damned good
start.

  This seems to be quite kosher to me, at least according to the HTTP spec.
The June 1993 draft does not go into detail on the Server: field, but it
seems logical to follow the same semantics as User-Agent in the request,
which would be:

<field> = Server: <product>+
	<product> = <word> [/<version>]
	<version> = <word>

  So the example you gave above would be perfectly legal.  Don't be like
some browsers and send multi-word things like 'Blah blah blah for the blah
blah blah system vXXX.YYY'  Someone posted a list not too long ago
detailing which browsers actually conformed to the User-Agent requirements
- percentage-wise, it was discouraging. :)  Let's not duplicate it on the
server side.

I think we just plain disagree here. I think that folks will want to
use the safe computing platform to build their applications, and that
Tcl doesn't scale to these applications. But only time will
tell. Today, I have to agree that the data are on your side. And given
the scope of programs you expect to deploy on the safe-computing
platform, I can see why you chose Tcl.

I'm a little bit confused when you say that Tcl will only be used for
these little user dialogs, and then you also say that the way to
extend the system is to distribute add on modules, presumably in Tcl:

>Safe-Tcl has a distributed library feature that allows a user or a site

I suppose it's reasonable to support add-on dynamically linked native
code modules.

By the way... I hope that authentication of modules is in the works...
I'd hate to have somebody forge a Safe-Tcl add-on module by attacking
DNS or whatever.


Hmmm... if we agree that Safe-* is only for "RPC with humans" and that
hence Safe-Tcl is sufficient for Safe-Tcl, the next step is to see how
Safe-Tcl integrates with distributed object technologies like HTTP,
CORBA, ILU, DCE, etc. that will be used to build the "guts" of these
CSCW applications. Hmm... there are Tcl bindings for Modula-3...
playing with that should keep me busy for a few late nights...

Well, there's two separate issues here.   As far as the "right" way to
distribute it, yes, they are add-on modules, written in Tcl, and this is
an example of why Tcl needs to be extended to support modules with
separate name spaces.  I believe this is part of the development plan
for Tcl anyway.  So what I'm saying is that most programs will
*probably* be small, but that extension packages will need Tcl extended
with modules, which is probably coming in any event.  When it does come,
it will make a lot of this discussion moot, as programming-in-the-large
with Tcl will be a lot less painful.

Secure DNS is one of the few areas of Internet security research that I
believe is truly important.

If you change "only" to "mostly", I don't have any problem with that
paragraph.  I'd like to think of Safe-Tcl as the "glue" that lets one
person's Scheme-based server talk to another person's Python-based
server and to reach out and ask questions of human users when
appropriate.  A lingua franca for the Internet.  It's a nice metaphor,
actually, because what you look for in a "lingua franca" is simplicity
and ease of learning/implementation, even at the possible expense of
some expressive power or elegance.  I'm reminded of that every time I go
someplace like Mexico and see a Japanese tourist communicating with the
locals in simplified English.

    The alternative seems to be to force everyone to write all their documents in 
    unicode, 

NOT force.  But encourage.  

    As I said yesterday, people in other countries already have methods for encoding 
    the characters of their national languages, and these methods should be 
    supported.

I agree.

    > If so, this will cause MAJOR interoperability problems across the network. 

    Why? 

Because it depends on whether you view the WWW as a clean homegeneous encoding
environment or a messy heterogeneous encoding nightmare.  In such an open 
endeaver I choose the latter.:-)

    Why would this cause more severe problems than forcing everyone to use 
    Unicode when authoring documents?
 
Because 1) it appears that WWW will doing it's own localization and 2) in order to 
support all the classes of localization services (display/fonts/languages/
input method/...)  WWW will need to agree (or "encourage") either
a. N methods for localizing - Macs, Windows, X11, ....
b. 1 method for all environments.

    > Expecting every client to be convert to from every possible encoding will
    > never work 

    [Is that "to be able to convert" ?]
    Sure it will. We *are* using a common libwww aren't we?

Yes, thanks. When it comes to I18N and localizing (e.g. Asian languages) you'll need to 
figure out how to customize the libwww such that the locale specific information
is split out.

    I appreciate what you are saying, but the picture is not entirely as you present 
    it for two reasons.

Basically true.  And this is a matter of degree of how much effort is put into 
enabling for multi-lingual, i.e. Universal instead of territorial.

    Firstly, not all clients will need to convert. Realistically, many of the 
    documents using a particular encoding will be read by people also using that 
    encoding. So, converting to Unicode on the server would impose a burden of two 
    encodings - to and from the same native encoding that the people are using in a 
    particular country.

I guess the folks from E. European (using Latin-2) aren't going to be able to 
view text from W. Europe (likewise for Greek, Turkish, Russian...).

    Secondly, the phrase "system administrators" rings warning bells here. 

Yes, I've noticed.

    Your 
    mental model seems to be of a technical support team running a server, doing 
    code conversion on all their documents to a common format, etc. This is the 
    traditional heavyweight publishing model. 

No.  Rather, it is to encourage that folks start generating documents in a common
format to gain wider audiences.   And to encourage the WWW to build tools for that
common format.  It sounds like I've reached the limit of where that encouragement 
is welcomed ..:-)

Finally, I want to re-emphasize that I don't want to force anyone one to one
encoding over the other.  I do want to encourage that we think globally in our
network view - that is all.

Hi,

please took a look to this http card:

http://dftuz.unizar.es/wwwlab/wwwcard/home.html

It works at least under NCSA mosaic, but currently it
is needed a lot of effort to make decent cards (even though that
a little less than imagemap).

What do you think about it? Is there around any program to generate
this kind of maps (or cards) more easily? 
Suggestions?

        I hate to dig-up old stuff.   It doesn't really matter
(to the scripts)  iff the server handles the parsing.

        So let me get this straight:  PATH_INFO  is that "extra"
information after the server has removed the path to the script?
In other words,  in

                http://server.domain/htbin/somthing/extra?search

        it would be set to  "extra".   Is that right?

Yep, except that the slash is included in it, so it's /extra
PATH_TRANSLATED is the result of translating that as if client had
asked for it, so it might be /some/directory/foo/bar/extra

Does anybody out there perhaps know of a set of criteria or maybe

Any pointers or opinions???

   I find this sort of information *from servers* to be extremely
   useful.

   In addition, one thing I've been cogitating on is how to express
   copyright restrictions/licensing terms/payment agent information in a
   way that a user's automated browser can read *before* fetching the
   entire document (i.e. using a HEAD request).  Making copyright
   comprehensible to a *program* (especially in my self-imposed limit of
   400 bytes, max) is a bit of a challenge.  (But I have some ideas which
   I will post later this month after they I get a chance to bounce them
   off some lawyers better educated in this area than I am.)

	      --karl--

I also have to address this issue. We should collaboratively make a list of
the elements in question, then we can better divide what needs to be done 
with each element and how we as a group can handle it.

I have stated before that I think it is pertinant to be able to
automatically search a "distributed directory of information" 
that would contain some of these elements. An agent, client ...
whatever could then find all relavent materials ( bounded by
some constaints ( part of the agent or client request, a multimedia 
"time to live" on steroids type of functionallity  :) ) and
return these to the actual user. The user software then can
intelligently (we hope!) choose what information, and at what
cost, copyright... they are willing to commit to downloading.

There is no reason HTTP has to be used for this 
"directory search mechanism" because there are no "shipping"
clients or servers that can do this now so everyone will need
to do work in one form or another to make it work.
If HTTP is used we need to define the extensions.

On the Safe-Tcl side of things: Each server should be able to
advertise ( in some fashion ) to clients, agents and other servers
what "native" core functionallity "each class" of user or agent
can use. It should also advertise what set of "mobile" functionallity
it is willing to bind with (IE being sent a safe-tcl script to
do group mailings, search for keywords etc...).

We need to list core agentd functionallity required for a server.
We need to list possible extendable functionallity an agent can give.

We need to define the "class" of users and how to safely determine
they are who they are (PGP...ect, don't invent but use :)


PS: I am using safe-tcl in general here, there may be something better
but you all can relate with it whether its what ultimately gets used.

   I think you may have missed a key point that Dave made.  We undoubtedly
   want very complex CSCW applications on the network.  But the part of
   such systems that has to be executed in a safe language is VERY limited.
    In particular, you only need to use Safe-Tcl for what I call "RPC to
   human beings".  Most of your work can go on inside trusted servers on
   the net, programmed in any language you like.  The role of Safe-*
   languages is much more limited -- it needs to be able to go off and
   interact with the user on his/her platform, but it needn't contain the
   whole application.  I think you overestimate the need for very large
   programs in the safe language.  However, I also agree that Tcl needs
   better support for modules. 

In a nutshell ( and maybe not to clearly ! ) this is what I was trying to
say needed to be broken into "core" functionallity and "mobile" functionallity.

The core functionallity is always "resident" in the server and can be written
in language du jour.

The "mobile" functionallity is interpreted and bound at runtime.

Lets Identify and list these two basic components.

Does this in any way allow me to specify a relative path which can be
expanded by CGI as the full path? I'd like to be able to say

	/cgi-bin/myscript/file-in-this-dir

and have the script be able to determine that it really needs to play with

	/usr/local/WWW/documents/project/smell-server/file-in-this-dir

or whatever. The absolute paths make it real hard to move hierarchies
around, trade 'em with your friends, etc.


Perhaps if I explicitely wanted an absolute path, I'd specify
something like: 

	/cgi-bin/myscript//full/leading/path/dir/file-in-this-dir

with a double slash.


Thanks.

Well, that's exactly what it does.

If you want this:

You would just have an Alias (or Map/Pass in CERN httpd) for
/file-in-this-dir to the absolute path.

That's not such a hot idea -- double slashes get removed by most
servers.

But that can be a difficult for non-www-admins. Even for webmeisters,
that's a nuisance if there are lots of scripts, imagemaps, etc.

Well, then: how 'bout being able to specify something like 

	/cgi-bin/myscript/./file-in-this-dir

where `.' gets intrepreted relative to the invocation, rather than
relative to the directory where the scripts live.

I don't really care what the syntax is; I'm just looking for something
which will allow specifying relative paths. Something which doesn't
require reconfiguring the server for each directory I have this need.

What I did for imagemaps at CERN was this; I had the ISMAP action URL
start with "/img" and then followed by a virtual path to the map file
itself, such as /foo/bar.map.  Now, if my "document root" is in
/public/web I'd have a config file:

	Map   /img/*      /cgi-bin/htimage/*
	Exec  /cgi-bin/*  /usr/local/cgi-bin/*
	Pass  /*          /public/web/*

The 1st one expands /img to the image handler script, 2nd one executes
it, and 3rd will translate the rest relative to document root.  Use
this approach creatively and you'll cope.  Note that once this is
correctly set up you don't need to edit the config file anymore.

Same thing, /./ gets transformed into a single /

I agree with all of this with one reservation (which to me is large
and which, to others, will perhaps be small)...

As I guess people are getting tired of hearing, my interest is in
adding means by which users can inject useful, and potentially
long-lived scripts into servers to perform various searching,
aggregation, and "watch for interesting posting" kinds of things.

My feeling is that the programming requirements for this kind of job
will involve more intensive computation (not necessarily in cycles,
but rather, in terms of long-lived and complex data structures) than
are readily supported by a language format in which there is a script
language holding together relatively separate primitive operations.

(How's that for an example of a truely run-on sentence?)

I think it is also important to add enough information so that the
user (or his/her client software) can "know" what restrictions are
imposed upon further use, copying, or redistribution of the material.

For example, I might publish a program and let you have a free copy,
but require that you do not distribute it further.  I.e, I want to
remain the one and only publisher of my intellectual property.

It may or may not be possible for me to actually prevent you from
republishing by technical means, but I think it is important that you
know up-front what your obligations are with respect to a document
should you chose to fetch it.

In the case of the copyright expression, I've been considering that we
have meta-headers that say what the terms and conditions are for
fetching the document and that there be a URL (URN?) embedded into the
meta headers which points to a document describing the restrictions on
use of that document after it has been fetched.

(This could get to be a recursive problem, as I know of people who
have copyrighted their software license contracts.)

I don't think these ideas necessarily apply in what I've been calling
the "Woolworth's" mode of WWW buying and selling -- i.e. simple
retail.  However, I think they are important to the big information
publishers.

Dear Colleague:

On Monday October 31 I'll be chairing a workshop, supported by NSF,
to provide the Information, Robotics, and Intelligent Systems (IRIS)
Division and NSF in general with a set of recommendations for future
programs, falling in the following three categories:

1.  Recommendations concerning use of WWW as an experimental platform
for collaborative efforts in the IRIS and computer science research
communities, including potential enhancements to WWW in support of
this.

2.  Recommendations concerning research which NSF in general and IRIS
in particular should consider undertaking with respect to the WWW,
its accessibility, and its usability.

3.  Recommendations on NSF information delivery to the public and
research communities via WWW.


THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS TO SOLICIT YOUR IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS
SO WE CAN INCLUDE THEM IN THE WORKSHOP DISCUSSIONS.  The workshop
itself will be a modest-sized gathering (see schedule at end of this
message with participants' names), so we want to use email as a way
to increase the set of ideas we discuss.

The results of the workshop will be available via WWW:  your response
to this message will ensure that you will receive a follow-up message
with the URL for the workshop.


Ways to think about the above three questions, and hence to
categorize your comments, include:

*  How might the research community supported by IRIS leverage on
methods of access, search, and navigation in the WWW to improve
communications amongst themselves, and with NSF?

*  What should the IRIS research programs consider for NSF page
content that would most help grow their investigative communities and
be most useful in dissemination and retrieval of NSF-related science
and technology information?

*  What issues are there regarding coordinating with information
sources from the professional societies of the investigative
communities that could be addressed via mosaic-like mechanisms, and
what role should NSF play in such an activity?

*  What format, linkage, or content guidelines, if any, should be
provided PIs to whose pages NSF pages point in order to enhance the
usefulness of the pages?

*  Are there any special "viewers" that might be of particular help
to the CISE and IRIS investigative communities, and how should they
be developed and supported?

*  How can we deal with potential information overload in the
research communities (e.g., intelligent agents to search/filter
information for specific investigative communities) and what
experimental research, if any, should be considered on these topics?

*  What research should be conducted in the area of user interfaces
(viewers)  to the WWW, in order to enhance the accessibility of the
information?  What is the role of information visualization
techniques?  Natural language?  Speech?  User adaptability?
Handicapped users?

*  How can we leverage on WWW (and NSF) for education and training of
   future researchers and PIs?


Incidentally, topics which will NOT be the focus of the workshop
include:

*  Policy, privacy and approval issues at NSF.

*  Information delivery technology and method considerations within
NSF.

*  Cost of WWW or Internet services.

Tech, pitkow@cc.gatech.edu, with Subject: NSF-WS.

Public places are: Airports, Museums, Public Libraries,
Hotel Lobbies, Shopping Malls, Train Stations, and so on.

Has anyone tackled creating a kiosk with:

* touch screen (rather than mousing)

* ruggedness -- so that people don't walk off with it :-)

* periodic updating (e.g. via dial-up) of the data on the hard
  drive (desireable especially if a fast network connection to the
  kiosk is not available/too costly and the data doesn't change
  too frequently)  

* using ISDN for periodic or permanent connections for kiosks?

A colleague of mine wanted to do some layout control, so he did it by hand and 
put it all inside a <pre>...</pre>.

Unfortunately (for me) he did it on a Mac, so the lines end only with ASCII 
carriage returns.  As a result, the Unix browsers (I've tried Mosaic, Chimera 
and Lynx) all treat it as a single line.

Does anybody not think this is a bug?  Whose bug is it?

Well, I have taken a bit more of time to compile
the gifs needed for the following example:

http://dftuz.unizar.es/wwwlab/spain/Spain.html

Take a view. It is a map of spain, as the ones of the Virtual Tourist,
but NO SERVER INTERACTION is required. It is close to the kind of things
I wait from a FIG directive, but a lot more complicated to write...

Perhaps with some overlay system it could be more easy. Anyway I dont
want to deep a lot on this, as a hypertext system would
be mainly TEXT-driven...

                         I begin to look this as a mean to reuse some
hypercard files.

I don't think it is a bug, really.  It is simply a difference in the 
way different machines treat the end of a line.

There are lots of programs that will convert CR -> CR/LF and vice-versa.  
On the mac I think that BBEdit will do the job.

   I think it is also important to add enough information so that the
   user (or his/her client software) can "know" what restrictions are
   imposed upon further use, copying, or redistribution of the material.

   For example, I might publish a program and let you have a free copy,
   but require that you do not distribute it further.  I.e, I want to
   remain the one and only publisher of my intellectual property.

   It may or may not be possible for me to actually prevent you from
   republishing by technical means, but I think it is important that you
   know up-front what your obligations are with respect to a document
   should you chose to fetch it.

   In the case of the copyright expression, I've been considering that we
   have meta-headers that say what the terms and conditions are for
   fetching the document and that there be a URL (URN?) embedded into the
   meta headers which points to a document describing the restrictions on
   use of that document after it has been fetched.

   (This could get to be a recursive problem, as I know of people who
   have copyrighted their software license contracts.)

   I don't think these ideas necessarily apply in what I've been calling
   the "Woolworth's" mode of WWW buying and selling -- i.e. simple
   retail.  However, I think they are important to the big information
   publishers.

		   --karl--

I agree! I think I brushed over that with to few words above.

It is important for the user to be able to choose between the
cost and copyright information that suits them best for
whatever they are searching for.
In order for publishers ( large and small ) to exist
in this scheme we must be able to do something similar to what you
are saying.

a HEAD or URL pointer to a standard format page may suit the task.

It's a bug of the guy who wrote it.  If he writes it on a Mac and then
xfers it to a Unix server he'll have to take care of transforming
linebreaks to conform to the host that the file sits on.  If his
server is a Mac, too, then the Mac server is required to do CR->CRLF
(or CR->LF).  If it doesn't it's a Mac server bug.

Documents specify that in practice LF with or without a preceeding CR
is a linebreak, but not plain CR.

Well, on the wire, everything should have embedded <cr><lf> for each line
break. If that's not what your server is sending (because you moved them to
UNIX, for example) then you should change the the linebreaks to just
linefeeds.

The bug is in moving the file from a Mac to a UNIX box without changing the
EOL characters.

Subject: Problems with Location: URI and CGI
content-length: 1402

We are building a WWW application that calls consecutive CGI server scripts
before sending the results back to the client.  We have one script that
handles the FORM which then calls another script which handles a call to
WAIS.

A problem that I have been grappling with for a while now is how to call
the second script.  We have successfully done this using "Location: URI".

However long, complex queries such as that shown here get truncated after
255 (?) characters.

Location: http://kaos.erin.gov.au/cgi-bin/SFgate?database=kaos.erin.gov.au:4500/new-sp-multi-erin&maxhits=40&tie=and&theme=MARINE&wbndgcoord+<+148.5+and+wbndgcoord+>+144.5+and+ebndgcoord+<+148.5+and+ebndgcoord+>+144.5+and+nbndgcoord+<+-39.0+and+nbndgcoord+>+-44.0+and+sbndgcoord+<+-39.0+and+sbndgcoord+>+-44.0

So my question is...

Is there a better way to call consecutive CGI scripts to avoid this problem
or is there something that I am missing?

Thanks for your help.

  this is a problem with the NCSA server - it truncates MIME headers to
MAX_STRING_LEN which defaults to 256.  This is defined in httpd.h

  Quick ugly hack to make it work - up the value of MAX_STRING_LEN.  Real
solution: make ncsa httpd able to handle real RFC822 headers (arbitrary
length, multi-line, etc).

You could call the 2nd script directly from the 1st. I've done
this to call a choice of scripts from one form using multiple
submit buttons.
Just change a few of the environment variables e.g. SCRIPT_NAME,
QUERY_STRING, REQUEST_METHOD if necessary.

Also, this way the server doesn't get hit twice for the same request.

This issue came up on the HTML Working group list.

The current practice[1] is that the LF character is what matters.

The spec will say that CRLF is the correct way to break a line,
but it will encourage browser implementors to accept LF alone
as a linebreak, and caution authors and editor implementors
that CR alone will _not_ work. (right, Mike?)

It should be noted that people who use desktop publishing software heavily
(Quark, Word, etc.) have it drilled into them to *never* put line breaks at
the end of the sentences, only at the ends of paragraphs.  Now, conceptually
asking them to end their lines with a hard break and beginning and ending
paragraphs in <P></P> might not sound too hard to us, but to them it's 
like asking them to use a Dvorak keyboard.  This actually came up in the 
realization by people here that typing long strings into TEXTAREA fields 
without line breaks is aesthetically pretty ugly and contrary to what 
most people are used to.

The logic seems back to front. Putting a <P> at the beginning of a paragraph
(the </P> is optional and rarely used) marks a para without line breaks
eaxctly as in a word processor. The original use of <P> at the end to break a
para was probably more natural but bad sgml.

TEXTAREA fields should always word wrap exactly as a word processor, and
are aesthetically, and in human factors, exactly what a word processor
user would expect.

The nice thing about html and forms is that they DO conform to what most
word processor users expect.

The semi-binary interpretation of <pre> is fine now that it is well-defined.
It will continue to confuse new users of html who naturally assume that
'preformatted' actually means simply 'preformatted', but will always be
essential to read the specifications carefully to use html correctly. It
is a precise programming language not a set of intuitively grounded
suggestions.

A few notes for those interested in disability access and the WWW:  

1) There are two presentations at the Mosaic conference in Chicago on access 
by persons with disabilities.  One will be by Paul Fontaine, and will be 
part of the HCI session on Tuesday.  I will also be doing a presentation, on 
Wednesday in the 2:15-3:45 slot, on emerging interfaces.  

2) The Trace Center has also just received two major grants in conjunction 
with the World Institute on Disability and the National Center on Accessible 
Media, and is working in conjunction with a number of disability 
organizations (ACB, AFB, NFB, UCPA, ...) to work on the development of 
cross-disability interface strategies and design guidelines for 
next-generation information systems.  

3) In addition, we are working on a number of WWW/Mosaic-specific projects, 
including:  

- a seamless cross-disability accessible interface strategy; 

- a cgi titled AltPage which a user could invoke which would automatically 
filter an HTML page and change it from a graphic to a text based page 
(including translating ISMAPs.  (This AltPage program should also find 
utility for people who have low bandwidth systems or would generally like 
faster access.)  

- a set of design guidelines and options for HTML pages to maximize their 
accessibility while preserving artistic expression.  


If you are interested in more information on these and related topics, write to 

curbcuts@trace.wisc.edu

or check our gopher / ftp server at 

trace.wisc.edu

later this month (or WWW next month).  We have also set up a listserve on 
access to the NII.

Really?  I thought the concensus was to encapsulate paragraphs in <P>, 
and that it *was* good SGML (and allowed things like <P ALIGN=CENTER>, 
which we really REALLY want).

What browser does this for you?  None of the ones I've tested do, I don't 
think....

Which is a good way to intimidate content providers away from HTML.  

Again, maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of this than I need to, 
expecially when doing a s/CR/CRLF/g is so easy to fix this problem.

Just so you know, ISMAP is designed so that a server can generate a text
menu for the image if the client asks for it (I designed it with this in
mind).  All the client has to do is request the URL without any mouse
coordinates and the server should return a text menu of the different
possible selections.

What does AltPage do differently?  Maybe I'm missing something important.

It is easy in SGML to state that the endtag is to omitted.

Indeed, the ones I use (x,mac) just use the line breaks in the content.

Has anyone been able to dump a large amount of text into a TEXTAREA
and have it show up right on WinMosaic?  What are the standards for
this and when (if it does not now) will WinMosaic work right.

There is an image that does exactly what it is supposed to do: work
as a clickable map, but produce a nice menu in case your browser
doesn't support ISMAP. (I should come up with a good ALT text for that
particular image though)

Unfortunalty NCSA's version of the daemon cannot handle this very well
(or something must have changed recently). The ISMAP handling program on
EXPO is a special purpose daemon which does detect browsers
incapable of ISMAP

Consistent use of the end tag would make the client side easier but it is
an option and this doesn't affect the annotation of the begin tag as you
have shown.

MacWeb does it. I'm not near a Sun at the moment to check XMosaic. Wrapping
is an available mode in text widgets so it's not a big deal. Since this
is all client side stuff it is a user option anyway. It's difficult to think of 
a situation where a user would not want word wrap in a TEXTAREA analogous to
the word wrap in the main document.

OK, I see your problem. Mosaic on the Mac doesn't word wrap on TEXTAREA and
doesn't seem to have a switch for it in the Style dialog. Our memo and
annotation servers have been tested with clients pasting word processor
files with 30K or more of text into TEXTAREA fields. This works fine
in MacWeb which is what we have been issuing routinely.

I agree - TEXTAREA fields without word wrap are not aesthetic! - should go
on the bugs/features list of Mosaic.

Root problem is that the client side is responsible for such matters of style
and one is talking of features not standards. However, it would make more
sense if the expected default behavior of a TEXTAREA was to wrap. Forms
are now being used for major data entry functions that go way beyond
their origins as a basis for more complex search requests.

Several months ago, I made a small patch to NCSA's `imagemap'
program (from the 1.3 distribution) to allow this.  The change 
was relatively simple, consisting of a check to see if coordinates 
were specified in the URL, and if not, to fake out the rest of 
the program to think the user `clicked' outside of a defined 
region.  It seems to work well.  I'll include the context diff 
here (and even brashly put a new version number on `imagemap') 
if anyone else is interested.  Please let me know if it doesn't
work for you!

In Wednesday's IHT there is an ordinary advertisement for (what seems to me to 
be) a venture capital firm.  Nothing strange in that.  

However, for people wanting more information, they give voice and fax numbers, 
e-mail, and -- a URL.  The URL is first.

I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

Subject: Re: Problems with Location: URI and CGI
content-length: 1012

Yesterday I asked for help with a problem I was having with calling
consecutive CGI perl server scripts.  I had one script that called
another using "Location: URI".  This worked fine for short queries but
long queries got truncated at 256 char.

The problem is that the NCSA server truncates MIME headers to 
MAX_STRING_LEN which defaults to 256.  Rather than increasing the value
in httpd.h and recompiling the server I took the other approach of using
a better way to call the consecutive script.

I set the CGI environment variables SCRIPT_NAME, and QUERY_STRING and
called the next script using...
exec '/var1/httpd/cgi-bin/SFgate'

Works a dream. Thanks for your help.

This seems to me to be a browser issue. You should be able to switch word
wrap on/off for TEXTAREA fields via a preference setting. I will try and
remember to get this right for the W3O browser for HTML 3.0 I am developing
with CERN.

	From: "Brian Gaines"  <gaines@fsc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca>

	Root problem is that the client side is responsible for such
	matters of style and one is talking of features not
	standards. However, it would make more sense if the expected
	default behavior of a TEXTAREA was to wrap. Forms are now
	being used for major data entry functions that go way beyond
	their origins as a basis for more complex search requests.

There is a server side issue here too.  What can server cgi programs
expect to receive?  If the form input is going to a mailbox, the
receiver of the mail may see only long lines truncated at 80 columns.
If the form input is going to be displayed within an HTML document, it
will be wrapped properly if it is not within <PRE></PRE> tags, but
then it will be one big paragraph.

It may not be sufficient for servers to automatically insert newlines
in the form input because perhaps the user intended some lines to be
longer.  Clients might have the same problem.  The bottom line is that
different kinds of text entry fields are required: no word wrap, word
wrap with no conversion, and word wrap with auto-insertion of newlines
by clients.  Servers should be able to specify what kind of text they
want back and clients should be able to let users specify what kind of
text they want to enter.  Conversion is required if there is a mismatch
between what serves and clients want.

Another related issue is how a newline is sent by clients.  It is not
a big deal for (Unix) servers to always do the following (in Perl):

  # Must be done in this order.
  $articleContent =~ s/\015\012/\012/g; # Convert PC's CR/LF into just LF.
  $articleContent =~ s/\015/\012/g;     # Convert Mac's CR into LF.

But it is one extra annoying thing that always has to be done, so why
not just have clients do it?  Servers might have to convert back to
their preferred standard, but there should be one intermediary standard.

Another related issue is how large VALUE strings and input fields can
be.  Servers have to know how large of a VALUE string they can send,
and clients have to know how large of an input string they can send.
Similarly, how large can URLs be?

I think this refers to several slightly different situations. Once they are 
separated out, there is no problem.

1) People using DTP software to create text files which are included in html 
documents. Here they do not insert line breaks, the dtp software does when it 
exports plain text.

2) People typing in plain text to include into html documents. The editor word 
wraps, using whatever local conventions it uses. The server for that platform 
should ensure that line breaks get transferred on the wire as CR LF

3) People typing html files using <p> and </p>, where line breaks are irrelevant 
and ignored.

Does that solve the problem?

It is indeed special purpose: it does not send any MIME headers and does not 
understand HEAD; neither does the (different) server that serves the parent 
document. I mean, what does `501 something broke' mean?

On the other hand, yes, it does provide an html text page which is great. Would 
people know to select a link that just says [image] though?

Chris, I hope you don't mind me posting this back to the list but I think
it's important to get this information out and make this clearer in the
HTML/HTTP documentation.

The documentation on ISMAP should be clarified but it's not obvious to me
where all this should go (there currently doesn't seem to be anywhere that
describes how HTML features map onto the URL).

In summary:
    A request to a URL with the ISMAP or SPACEJUMP attribute should
    either contain a standard query with the relevant index coordinates
    (from mouse selection or other) or it should not contain a query
    at all, in which case the server should generate a reply assuming
    that the client doesn't have the capability to index in the required
    manor (generally the server will return an HTML document with a
    list of the choices).

Chris Lilley, Computer Graphics Unit writes:

Plexus does this in practice.  In the imagemap file you can either specify
a menu description string (and have a menu generated on-the-fly) or you
can specify a default document.  I believe that most active images served
by Plexus servers use one of these methods.

Here is the orig prototype:
    http://www.bsdi.com/server/walk/walk.html
The decoding URL is:
    http://www.bsdi.com/decode-walk
If you request that URL without a query then you will get a menu.

All it took to set this up was this in the map file:
    decode-walk default server/walk/default.html

> Certainly the NCSA server does not seem to behave like this.
Then it should be fixed (patches have already been posted).

There is no reason that text-only clients should not be able to
fully operate in the WWW environment while still allowing full
experimentation with graphical navigation.

These different examples illustrate that the form input is just an input
to a server program. It is the server program that determines the SEMANTICS
of what is being sent. If one examines the wide range of applications of
forms on the web currently, the only common factor is that forms provide
data entry fields in client-server applications.

The same considerations apply to values and url's. They can be arbitrarily
large dependent on the semantics of the application. This is a normal
problem in an interactive system. A user's activities are circumscribed
by what it makes sense to do within the context of the application. If
a user action is meaningless then it is a user error, otherwise the
system designer should have set up the system to function correctly.

A problem with WWW clients is that the designer may not be able to
find a client currently that does not impose some limitations. Another
problem is that the the user may have configured the client incorrectly
for the application. The first problem will disappear with the evolution
of clients. The second make desirable some capability for the server to
be able to check features of the client.

At the server end there should be no problem since the software is totally
under the control of the system designer. Again, limitations arise if
the designer attempts to use some existing servers and cgi mechanisms,
but these are far more easily overcome than client limitations.

All these issues are arising because the addition of the forms capability
enabled general client-server applications to be supported through WWW.
What was originally designed as an information retrieval system is being
used to support highly interactive applications, tele-robotics, MUDs, etc.

The standardization of HTML 2.0 has clarified the existing GUI, and Dave
Raggett's prototyping of HTML 3.0 is adding better control of interactivity
in the GUI through scripts (which could be used to provide feedback to
a user if a value entered was meaningless at some coarse level such as
too long).

Tim Berners-Lee's original specification of the HTTP protcol provides for
client-server negotiation, and this needs similar standardization to
support applications that depend on client features that are not universally
supported.

One issue that it would be nice to revisit is the way in which form data
is packed into a string and returned by POST. Historically, the current
format is a decision made by Marc Andreessen in order to get Mosaic 2.0 out.
It bypassed discussion about using MIME multipart and other formats to
return form data to the server.

The current format is adequate and easily decoded, but incongruous with
the use of the MIME standard elsewhere. It would be cleaner to move to
a MIME multipart format as the standard while retaining the current
=&% escaped format as a depreciated usage for a few years.

DESCRIPTION
WinWeb is a World Wide Web client which uses hypertext, or hypermedia
where references within a document are links which lead users to other
documents, lists, resources or actions.  The World Wide Web supports
the display of text, graphics, sound, and video.  It is also a tool
through which Internet users can access information using from various
other Internet front ends, navigators, information, services, and
resources.

WINWEB FEATURES
16 Bit Program - WinWeb works with the current versions of
       Microsoft Windows and does not require the installation of the
       Win32s subsystem.
Performance - WinWeb uses a unique two-level cache to maximize
       performance.  Documents can be quickly revisited without any
       network overhead.
Hotlists -  WinWeb provides a Hotlist dialog box for saving frequently
       used documents and revisiting your favorite information sources.
Easy to Navigate - You can navigate using the toolbar or the Navigate
       menu.
Easy to Download Files - You can easily and intuitively download any
       Web document.  You simply click on the Load to File icon to
       download documents or files to your local hard drive.
Proxy Support - WinWeb supports CERN-style proxy servers.  This is
       easy to configure through a simple Proxy Server Configuration
       dialog box.
Full Print and Print / Preview Capability - Color printers are supported
       and printed output is reformatted to fit the selected page size.
Viewers Included - WinWeb includes external viewers for GIF and JPEG
       style bitmaps, as well as almost any audio format.
Inline Image Support - WinWeb supports inline images in either GIF or
       XBitmap format.
Local File Support - WinWeb supports the display of local HTML files 
       through the use of the Open File dialog box.
Stand-Alone PC Support - WinWeb runs on non-networked Windows PCs
       without additional configuration or files.
History List - A complete history list is maintained of every link
       you've visited.  Revisiting old pages is as easy as selecting
       an item from the list.
Many Protocols Supported - HTTP, FTP, and Gopher protocols are all
       supported through a consistent, easy-to-use interface.
Customizable Home Page - WinWeb defaults to the EINet Galaxy home
       page, but can be easily changed to use any home page on the Web.
Customizable Views - Both fonts and colors can be changed to
       customize the viewing of Web documents.

The HTML 2.0 definition unfortunately currently limits both URLs and  
VALUE attributes to 1024 characters (the SGML LITLEN parameter).

I would like to know is whether there is there any specific reason,  
based on current practice, for this rather small value.  I would  
advocate increasing LITLEN to the maximum possible value consistent  
with the limitations of current practice.  (The only browser I know  
that does any truncatation of FORM fields sans MAXLENGTH is  
MacMosaic, and it appears to truncate them to an unacceptable 256  
characters.)

 New features:

 - `sd' support:

	- mcm-daemon sends sd packets if run with -sd option

	- just few lines to add in your .sd.tcl to run mcm-start from sd

 - simple authentication of session creator (just IP number test, should be
enough for intended use)

 - ability to see who is attending the session (only for people who want to
be seen). Output is UGLY (just names@machines and tabs).

 - added a "Not yet started" state

 - can now be used in unicast or broadcast mode

 - quick-install script

 See the README file for further explanations.

 Enjoy,

    -JCT-

Chris makes a good point. The question regarding a link to an entity identified
as [image] could present problems unless that link was a unique identifier to
the UI. 

The discussion we've had here is inspiring, and we are all sending a strong
message to the NCSA and service providers that universal access is a key issue. 

If you will be attending the Mosaic conference in Chicago or Internet '94 in
D.C., and would like to continue to take part in these discussions, please 
feel free to contact Drew Browning, Gregg Vanderheiden, or myself.

Hi,

Two weeks ago I posted a proposal for file upload.  The small discussion that
followed concentrated on the encoding of the files: "multipart/partial",
"aggregate/mixed", and others were suggested.  No responses disagreed with the
addition to the HTML specification.  A few responses disagreed with some
aspects of the proposal, but none disagreed that file upload would be useful in
the WWW.

Larry Masinter has suggested a file upload BOF meeting at WWW Fall 94 in
Chicago.  Please see proposal 16 in:

   http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/bof.shtml

File upload would be extremely valuable to many WWW applications.  See the
responses to the BOF meeting proposal for an example in the medical field.
Even the BOF article submission server above would benefit from file upload.  I
hope it'll be possible to see a TYPE "file" added to the HTML INPUT tag and to
have browser support for this new type as soon as possible.  (No changes to
HTTP required).

Thank you.

Ernesto Nebel

I seem to recall that the proposal involved HTTP clients kinda acting
like servers, in that certain content types were supposed to trigger
the client into sending files.

This seems like an HTTP protocol change to me.

And what of security? What's to stop a server from responding with

	Content-Type: application/file-upload-request

	/etc/passwd

Hmmm.. it seems like the client should remember what files it told the
server that it wanted to upload. Now you've got implicit state between
transactions. How long does the client wait for the server to respond
before throwing the state away?

(I'm afraid I'm asking questions that have been covered, but I
can't seem to find a copy of the proposal. The BOF announcement,
for example, doesn't have a link to it.)

	I am very interested in this,a s one of the applications I'm
working on needs to upload files in the range of 20-200 Mbytes.

	Unfortunately, proposal 16 is not visible at the moment.  The
BOF page jumps from item 14 to 26:

Oops... I found a copy of the proposal. I see there are no HTTP
changes after all -- security concerns are addressed by having
the user interactively confirm the file upload.

By the way... how do the users of the modified browsers like the
feature?

As of September, WWW on NSFNET was fifth in number of packets and
third in total byte count.

These values were taken from nic.merit.edu's NSFNET stats from Jan 1993
to Sept 1994.  Max plotted value is 5082138200 packets (www peak), other
values scaled to fit (approx 65 million packets/column).  Gopher(g) seems
to be on a fairly linear curve and WWW(w) seems to be growing exponentially.
I wonder when WWW will begin to level out?

The NFSNET total for Sept was 18.6 Terabytes (7MB/second), which is
double what it was this time last year.  WWW is doubling about every
4 months.

I'd like to share with you all how I spent my day today.  It was spent 
dealing with the fact that the above is far far from standard on even the 
most common browsers, in particular NCSA's.  I basically bent so far over 
backwards to support bugs in a particular browser that I could tie my 
shoes if I wanted.

I'm building what many of you have built as well, which is a conferencing
system using CGI scripts and forms.  A user enters in a bunch of text,
submits it, they get back "how-this-would-look" to double-check that what
they are looking at looks nice and decent when rendered in a browser, and
then approves it forward.  The document information is kept in hidden form
fields on that intermediate page. 

The only translation I knew I had to do to safely store any arbitrary 
text inside an attribute field in an INPUT tag was " and > - so for the 
interim I translated them to their SGML entity equivalents of &quot; and 
&gt;.  lee@sq.com confirmed that according to the SGML DTD, anything 
except another quote could be in that field.  The only reason I was 
escaping > was for lenient browsers that allow that to signify the end of 
the INPUT tag.

So, this was what I expected to work fine everywhere:

<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="content" VALUE="<P&gt;Nice day, isn't it?">

This worked like a charm on X Mosaic.  MacMosaic, however, didn't - it 
didn't escape the & character to %26 when submitting the form, so it got 
quickly recognized as another field delimiter by my POST data parser.
So one option I figured was to do the hex translation for it, but that 
didn't work either, as it properly translated the % character to %25!  
I finally gave up and decided to use the # sign instead of the & sign 
for psuedo-SGML-entities, and de-convert it on the other side before 
writing to a file.  So, finally, this worked:

<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="content" VALUE="<P#gt;Nice day, isn't it?">

Well, almost.  Now it turns out it croaks on the ' character too, 
interpreting that as the end of the field, giving me

Content = <P#gt;Nice Day, isn

Aaarg!  So, I get to have fun escaping that, too.  Are there any more 
characters MacMosaic doesn't do the right thing with?  

Of course, to get this information I had to deal with a broken view-source
option, with crashes after approximately every 8 accesses which caused the
machine to reboot (on a sufficiently stable Quadra), and experiment many
times just to find where this bug was happening.  I won't even get into the
CR/LF situation.  Now I get to repeat this process with the other browsers we
want to list as acceptable - as it stands now there isn't a single free
browser for MS Windows that does both forms and user authentication without
serious problems.  And yes, I have been working with the most recent 
versions and even tried previous versions. 

I have been saying this privately but have been holding back to say it here
for fear of offense, but it *has* to be said.  The state of WWW software,
commercial and free, is pathetic.  This isn't any one person's fault, isn't
any one institution's fault - but the fact that I had to go way way way out
of my way to support bugs in browsers that could take seconds to fix is
absolutely pathetic.  I could care less about additional features in browsers
if the underlying systems are broken so badly.  Bugs I can understand,
especially in alpha software.  Persistant bugs I can forgive - I'm sure I'm
not the only one who has detected this as a bug and notified them, and some
bugs take awhile to fix.  But the total lack of serious advancement in this
area since Spring of this year is pretty much embarrassing, and a total
turn-off for the major content providers who want to get into the game but
are scared off by the flakiness of it all.  The browsers work 90% of the
time, but it's that 10% that debilitates us.  Free software doesn't have to
be flaky - look at software put out by GNU.  I'm playing the game here from a
different vantage point than most of you, and I think you should know that
the WWW is in pretty good danger of balkanization and fragmentation, if not
dissolution, if we don't get our collective hiney in gear, and soon.

Flame me if you want for these points, but I can pretty much anticipate your
responses - "no one's paying us to make free software" "it's a lot harder
than you think" "all the good guys got usurped by industry", etc. I wouldn't
be saying this if I felt those point negated my own.  For NCSA's sake I'll
say their line is definitely impressive considering the majority of the work
is done by undergrads and grads.  And Kim, I personally apologize for making
a big point about a small bug in an otherwise pretty good program, it is only
one instance of a bigger problem.  And yes, "why don't I try programming a
better browser myself" is a flame expect, to which I counter I'm busting my
butt from the other end of the spectrum, building content and applications. 
In fact, I'd love to fix code, if only source code were made available! 

I guess the final conclusion is

W3O WHERE ARE YOU?

We *need* our own standards-setting body, one with links and references to
IETF but ultimately one that can be a lot more responsive and flexible and
not have to wait half a year for a standard to be implemented. A part of that
*must* be a stable of programmers dedicated to pulling this together.  I KNOW
you will find institutions willing to help fund this - universities, research
institutes, AND publishers.  The success of Mosaic has pretty much proved
what a great business giving away software can be. 

I guess we'll find out in two weeks in Chicago.  In the mean time check out
W3O's pages at CERN. 

Heretically yours, 

	Brian

As some 137 of you are aware, last week I announced two experimental
pages with a flavour between imagemap and hypercard, but not server

As a colateral result, I have got some stats on the patiente of 
WWW-aficionados when downloading a small page. It is illustrative only,
as I have not verified kind of browser, nor comms problems.

It is also courious to note that the second image, which was much better
in quality than the hypcard one, was notoriously less requested.

Since I'm currently on the wrong side of the atlantic, and I can't get lynx to
deal with the 
bof-request form properly, would it be possible for someone to add a bof request
to
the page in Urbana? 

The BOF is the one I mentioned a few weeks ago on HTTP futures - it might be
suitable for merging with the IETF liason bof, but the audiences might be
sufficiently different to make this not worth-while

Hi,

I have a question about representing special characters.

I know how to represent special _alphabet_ characters such as an _e_ with
an acute accent.

Is it possible, or will it become possible sometime, to represent
non-alphabet characters such as the _guillemotleft_ and _guillemotright_
that act as open and close quotes in some languages?

(Sorry to post this to both www-talk and www-html, but I wasn't sure which
list was more appropriate)

The TEXTAREA tag was introduced to overcome this limitation on form fields.
GET was depreciated in favor of POST to overcome the problem for URLs.
The HTML 2.0 DTD specifies that TEXTAREA tags enclose PCDATA which is not
subject to the LITLEN limitation of 1024 characters. Clients should not
truncate TEXTAREA form fields but rather give an error message if memory or
text widget limitations make it impossible for them to accept further text.

Of course, none of this addresses your question as to whether it is
necessary for LITLEN to be so small, or whether existing clients truncate
TEXTAREA data.

For this particular case, the answer is yes. In fact, for all characters
in ISO8859-1, the answer is yes. To see the ISO8859-1 character set,
if you're in an X shop, invoke:

	xfd -fn '*-courier-medium-r-*-ISO8859-1'

You'll notice the little << and >> characters are at positions 171 and 187,
respectively. If you can convince you're editor to insert character
171 in the document (e.g. ctrl-q,2,5,3 in emacs), you're in business.
Otherwise, you can use the character reference markup:

	guillemotleft:	&#171;

Hmmm... yes: mosaic correctly handles this markup.

>(Sorry to post this to both www-talk and www-html, but I wasn't sure which

Well, in fact, www-html suffered something of administrative
catastrophe recently, and I'm not sure it has recovered. I haven't
seen a message from www-html in months.

By the way... how does one unsubscribe from www-announce?
I tried
	echo "unsubscribe connolly@hal.com" \
		| mail www-announce-request@info.cerh.ch

with no luck.

Well, the first thing I did wrong was to misinterpret the clearly written
HTML 2.0 documentation. I was trying to represent the characters using
_&guillemotleft;_, which is an option for the alphabet characters. Not sure
why I thought that would work.

Mosaic for the Mac (2.0Alpha 8 version), which is the browser I use to
check my progress while writing HTML documents, doesn't seem to recognize
&#171;.

I've also just tried version 1.03, which _does_ recognize it!

Anyway, thanks.

File upload is *very* important for the Web and I hope some consensus  
is reached soon!  However, I strongly disagree with Ernesto Nebel's  
proposal, and would instead advocate the following alternative  
(combining a number of proposals aired on this list):

*  On the client end, support a FORM field which can accept input of  
arbitrary MIME content (not just text/plain from the keyboard).  The  
most natural way would be to upgrade the behavior of TEXTAREA.

*  For the POST submission, support a multipart encoding scheme that  
circumvents the overhead of the current www-url-encoding for large  
inputs.

Here are the main reasons I am opposed to Ernesto's proposal:

1.  While it's true that the proposal would not alter the syntax of  
HTTP, it would force a drastic change in the semantics: making HTTP  
servers stateful, with all of the problems that entails.  Thus,  
during the multiple back and forth transactions would be required to  
completely transmit the data in a FORM, the server would have to  
somehow generate unique "transaction URLs" that allow the client to  
connect back to the correct transaction, and furthermore, it would  
have to manage the partial transaction data for the different clients  
as it accumulates.  This would also add serious complications to CGI,  
(for example, requiring global script changes to handle a simple  
change of field from type TEXTAREA to FILE).   These are rather large  
issues to stir up for one extra feature (important as it is).

2.  Having a special "FILE" INPUT type deprives users of the choice  
to enter small amounts of ASCII data directly into the FORM, if they  
so choose.  Even for small input, they would instead have to prepare  
an external file with the data, and then use a file browser to  
register that file with the FORM.

It also doesn't recognize  &eumlaut;  and mistakenly treats <BR>
the same as <P> inside unordered lists.
I recommend against using MacMosaic as a reference implementation -- it's
a great application, but I wouldn't use it as a reference.

This, I think, is the difference between free software which includes
source code and that which doesn't -- these bugs would have been fixed
within days of an XMosaic release, because a thousand different programmers
would ferret out the bugs and at least one would publish a relevant patch.

Well, the platform I work on is a Mac. Until some (presumably, though I
realize not neccesarily) more robust commercial software becomes available,
MacMosaic is what I have.

I thought I'd be doing well to make sure the HTML code I generate is legal!
Keeping track the limitations (or bugs) of the various browsers seems a
little more challenging. A colleague who checked my document in the current
Windows version of Mosaic found that _&eacute;_ in the document's title
didn't display correctly, though it did on my Mac.

I've noticed this in Lynx, too.  I think I once sent
a message to the Lynx developers about this, and they
responded with a note saying that <TITLE> wasn't 
supposed to contain &foo; entities.  Can this be true?

Well... as of the current HTML 2.0 spec, TITLE can contain entity
markup (e.g. &eacute). You can't blame the lynx guy tho: the HTML
internet draft of July 1993 said title cannot contain &eacute;.

I tried an xxx directory under documentRoot with index.html in it, and an
index.html (both as an executable script and as pure html) under the xxx

A proposal for an HTML style sheet scheme is available from

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People/howcome/p/cascade.html

>From the abstract:

  CASCADING HTML STYLE SHEETS -- A PROPOSAL
    
  This document proposes a style sheet scheme for HTML documents.
  The proposed scheme provides a simple mapping between HTML
  elements and presentation hints. Properties like font family 
  and window size can be suggested by the style sheet, and it can
  also provide logic to make presentation decisions based on the
  user's environment; e.g. the size of the screen or the current
  date.
  
  The style sheet scheme is designed so that style sheets can be
  cascaded; the user specifies initial preferences and hands the
  remaining influence over to the style sheets referenced in the
  incoming document. This will provide publishers with stylistic
  influence without resorting to page description languages.
  
  The scheme supports visual as well as non-visual media.
  
Comments are solicited.

It would be useful if you could be more specific.  For example, how
would you put a 100MB binary image file into the upgraded TEXTAREA?
Please explain the behavior of the upgraded TEXTAREA in more detail.

I agree that a multipart encoding scheme is the best way to encode the
transmission of the files.  Several schemes have been suggested
already, including multipart/partial, multipart/mixed, and
aggregate/mixed.  I deliberately omitted any mention of the encoding
of the files in my proposal.  I suggested encoding the form data as
usual, www-form-urlencoded, because the form only sends the file names
and file sizes (in my proposal).

Servers would only become stateful iff the writer of the forms chose
to make it stateful.  Let me explain with a ficticious example.
Suppose I'm a book editor and I put up a server so that authors can
submit manuscripts for my review.  I make a form that includes an
INPUT tag of TYPE "file", where the author will enter the paths to all
the chapters that make up his manuscript.  The browser sends the file
names and sizes to a CGI script at the server, all www-form-urlencoded
with the rest of the form data.  The browser does not need to remember
anything about the data it just sent.  The CGI script responds to this
form submission with data of a new MIME type (as mentioned in the
proposal) that contains the full URL to another CGI script (which will
accept the files) and the paths to all the chapters of the manuscript.
Then, the server can forget about the form submission that just
ocurred.  It does NOT need to keep any state information.  The
browser, which, again, does NOT need to remember anything about the
form submission, reacts to this new MIME type by showing the author
the paths to the chapters of the manuscript that will be sent to the
editor's server, and it prompts him for confirmation.  When the author
confirms, the browser encodes the manuscripts (with a multipart
scheme) and sends them to the CGI script (remember, the server just
told the browser which files to send and which URL to use).  This
second CGI script at the server, which again does NOT need to have any
state information, receives the files and stores them in the "incoming
manuscripts" directory of the editor's computer.

Keeping state information is completely optional.  (By the way, some
server applications already keep state information with the help of
forms' HIDDEN fields.)

I don't know exactly what you mean.  The writer of the forms knows
that he has to write two CGI scripts to handle file input if he
chooses to include one or more INPUT tags of TYPE "file".  The first
just accepts www-form-urlencoded information like any form CGI script
does today.  The second CGI script will handle unencoding the files
and storing them in the server's file system.  A skeleton for the
first kind of CGI script is already widely available, and a skeleton
for the second kind of CGI script could be made widely available as
soon as the file encoding is decided.

The only remaining issue I can think of is: how does a CGI script (the
one that accept the form data, including file names and sizes)
distinguish between form data supplied by a browser which supports
file upload and one which does not?  What I suggested in the proposal
is to check the name/value pairs.  A browser with supports file upload
will send at least two name/value pairs associated with the TYPE
"file" INPUT tag: the first will contain the number of file names and
the rest will contain the file paths and file sizes.  A browser which
does not support file upload will only send one name/value pair
corresponding to the text field it created in place of the file field
(text fields are the default in the HTML DTD).  If a form writer
included an INPUT tag of TYPE "file" with NAME "fileinput" and a
client entered two valid file names, a browser with file upload
support could send:
 
name = fileinput    value = 2
name = c:\project\chapter1.wp    value = 3452
name = c:\project\chapter2.wp    value = 5234
 
(This is only an example.  The browser could also send two name/value
pairs per file, one for the path and one for the size, or something
else.  The format of these name/value pairs can be settled later).

A browser without file upload support would send:
 
name = fileinput value = c:\project\chapter1.wp c:\project\chapter2.wp

The CGI script would only have to examine the name in the name/value
pair that follows the "fileinput" name/value pair.  If there is no
other name/value pair or if the name matches the name of the next
field in the form, then the CGI script knows that the browser does not
support file upload.  If the CGI script finds another name/value pair
and the name does not match the name of the next form field in the
form, then the CGI script knows that the browser supports file upload
and that the value of the "fileinput" pair contains the number of
files names sent.  I don't think this is very complicated.  One string
compare is all it takes.

I don't think this argument is sufficiently strong to invalidate my
proposal.  The form writer should make an educated guess as to the
data it will get from the client.  If he expects multiple, huge image
files, he will definitely use TYPE "file" INPUT tags.  If he expects a
single text file, he might choose to use a TEXTAREA instead.
 
 
All comments appreciated.

        You could take a look at the Webmaster's Starter Kit.
If you have access to a World Wide Web client  (like Mosaic or Lynx)
then see the URL

                http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/doc/

        But that won't have the VM server.   Since you posted to the
www-vm  list,  I wonder,  was that the server platform you had in mind?

Subject: Nesting of HTML elements
content-length: 938


Hello. Can anyone point me to a definitive answer as to whether
or not HTML tags - for headers and text elements - can be nested
and have the appearence be relatively consistent 
(not completely dependant on the specific HTML parser used)
vs. non-nested tags.

In english, is browser performance well defined for cases like:

<BODY>
<H1> heading1 <P>
<H2> heading 2 <P>
<H3> heading 3 <P>
</H3>
</H2>
</H1>
</BODY>

vs. (will this appear the same as)

<BODY>
<H1> heading1 <P> </H1>
<H2> heading 2 <P> </H2>
<H3> heading 3 <P> </H3>
</BODY>

even in the same browser? (MacMosaic is yes, MacWeb is no).

The HTML DTD does mention

<!ENTITY % stext  -- as htext but also nested structure --
   "P | HR | %list | DL | ADDRESS
   | PRE | BLOCKQUOTE
   | %literal | %htext">

but I have to admit to ignorance in reading BNF grammer,
such as in the DTD, correctly. 

Your experience and advice is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Bob Powell

It is good to see that there are still people working on style
sheets. The `cascading style sheets' proposal is indeed a step
forward, but it needs a lot of work. Let me start with some criticism
and then try to suggest how I think the proposal can be repaired.

The idea that two designs can be averaged to come up with an
intermediate style seems utterly wrong to me. What happens when my
blue-on-yellow style is combined with somebody else's yellow-on-blue?
Do I get green-on-green? Or who wants to look at a page with
Avant-garde titles over Helvetica paragraphs?

Design is far too subtle for that and combining styles is almost
impossible. Unless you want to endow the browser with a lot of
artifical intelligence, there are only three reasonable possibilities:

  1. neither the document nor the user expresses any preference
  2. the document specifies a style sheet
  3. the user specifies a style sheet

In case 1, the browser's configuration determines the default style.
Case 3 has priority over case 2.

Expressions in the style specification that are to be evaluated by the
browser make the language far too difficult. Besides, I don't think
there is any need for them.

  - The document's author knows the AGE of the document, it's up to
    him to specify the corresponding style. He can use whatever means
    he wants, including a macro pre-processor.

  - Selecting a style based on RELEVANCE is an issue for the browser
    and the user, the document's author shouldn't try to base his
    design on RELEVANCE.

  - Specifying a font size as twice its previous value is meaningless
    in a style language where the order of the specifications is
    unimportant: either a specification applies or it doesn't.

Having two different names for the same property is confusing.
E.g.: `head.align' instead of the six terms `h1.align'...
`h6.align'. Besides `head' is also the name of an HTML element.

Allowing style sheets to be loaded anywhere else than in the HEAD not
only leads to ugly lay-outs and difficult to maintain documents, it is
also unnecessary if the ID attribute of elements is used (see below).


These are the changes I propose:

The rules for cascading of style sheets are as follows:

  1. When the user selects one of his own style sheets, the LINK'ed
     style sheets are ignored.
  2. Otherwise, all LINK'ed styles are loaded in order, combining
     their rules as follows (cf. the X resources):
     a. specific overrules general, i.e., rules with wildcards give
	way to rules without them.
     b. if two specifications are the same, the one encountered first
	will take precedence.
  3. Style sheets that are included from other style sheets are
     treated as if they were literally included at the position where
     they are referenced.

Rules allow no expressions. When the designer finds it convenient to
work with macros or expressions, he should arrange to apply a macro
processor to the style sheet before the server sends it out.

I would like to introduce a new type of value: an indirect value
specified as a URL, e.g.: body.background =
@http://some.where/rice-paper.xpm. Maybe this is only allowed for
certain properties.

The `cascading style sheets' may well grow to become quite
complicated, but in theory they are meant for designs that do not
demand the highest quality. That means that there must be room for
linking additional style sheets in different languages for browsers
(or printer drivers) with sophisticated formatters. I suggest that the
syntax of the LINK element is changed to allow, e.g.:

  <LINK REL="style/hssl" HREF="simple.style">
  <LINK REL="style/dsssl" HREF="complex.style">

The browser chooses an appropriate one. Alternatively, the browser
retrieves all style sheets and then decides on the basis of their
Content-Type, but that is somewhat inefficient.

Rules can be attached to generic elements (`classes') or to specific
ones. I suggest the same convention as in the X resource database: a
capitalized first letter indicates all instances of an element,
lowercase indicates a particular instance. Instances are referred to
by their ID. Compare:

  P.align          para27.align
  Div1.font.size   scr_div.font.size
  H1.above         ch2_title.above

(Difficulty: IDs may include a `.') I'm not sure whether the
uppercase-rule should be a convention or an integral part of the
syntax.

Elements in HTML can have attributes that influence the lay-out, such
as <OL COMPACT> or <P ALIGN=LEFT>. The best way would be to remove
those attributes from HTML. If necessary, we could introduce new GI's
instead of those attributes that also have a semantic function, as in
the case of <UL WRAP=VERT>


The proposal is definitely worth developing further. It would make the
discussion easier if there was also a list of all the properties of
all elements. That list will evolve, of course, but then at least we
can check if all the properties fit into the proposed syntax. I'm
especially interested in the supported media types: display, printer,
speech synthesizer, etc.


Thanks for the work, Hakon!

Hi all,

How is BASE supposed to be interpreted ?

I like the way Xmosaic does it - by replacing the current URL
with that specified by the document. However, other people think
it should just provide a way to resolve relative URLs. One beta
client even allows multiple BASEs to be present in any part of the document.

The HTML 3 spec is ambiguous (to me anyhow), as to how BASE is to 
be interpreted.

As a compromise, I'd suggest that if there's a BASE inside the <HEAD>,
then this should be treated as a replacement URL and relative URLs are
relative to it. The client will not attach its own BASE when exporting
the current document, if one exists inside <HEAD>.

If a BASE appears outside the <HEAD> then it doesn't replace the existing
URL, but does affect subsequent relative URLs.

There's an argument that allowing the displayed URL to change can
be used to trick the user into thinking (s)he's at some other site. -
a simple solutions is to display both the original URL and the new URL
if they have different host addresses.

I can provide examples of how useful the Xmosaic interpretation is
if required.

regards,
rob.

the example of expo (the palace of split exhibit, spalato at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/tiecket_office.html)
and said that I would improve things by a more alt tag, I hope people
are satisfied with it now.

HOWEVER, at the same time I discovered something that might be called a bug
in x mosaic: when I have delayed image on, and click on the arrow part in
the 'delayed image' x mosaic will happely follow the link and send the mouse
coordinates, which are ofcourse completely useless. In fact it should
act as text browsers do, and not send the coordinates.

I know I should email this directly to NCSA, but still I don;t think they
read it (at least I got no response on a fix for broken code. It has been
fixed a long long time ago, but still the code is broken, most promenently
shown when using mosaic with fish search; thanks to the fish-search people
finding this again) (I mailed them recently with no response)

Dan,

Unfortunately, we have not had time to create a fully operational prototype of
the file upload proposal I posted.  However, we have modeled the UI and gotten
some feedback from potential users.  We have found that this model of
interaction provides the most versatility to users for uploading multiple files
and providing security, and to servers for providing backward compatibility and
potentially controlling when (and if) the files are uploaded.

Soon we hope either to recruit someone to create a prototype or to create it
ourselves.  (Any volunteers?)

Ernesto

PS: We have created a simple, single file, one-step, file upload capable
browser (modified Mosaic), but we think the proposed model is better for the
reasons above.

I like that: "a difinitive answer" -- not THE definitive answer, but
any old definitive answer. How about this one: no.

But seriously... the HTML working group has been debating questions
like this since around May. We even fire up the browsers and test them
when in doubt.

The result of all the hot air is the HTML 2.0 specification, coming
soon to an RFC archive near you. You can join in the fun by visiting:

	"HTML Specification Review Materials"
	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec

Well, we realized that for a few folks out there, the DTD doesn't make
things crystal clear. So Mark Gaither and I at HaL have set up a forms
interface to a validating SGML parser at

	"HaLsoft HTML Validation Service"
	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-test/service/validation-form.html

so you can ask questions just like the one below:


>In english, is browser performance well defined for cases like:
>
><BODY>
><H1> heading1 <P>
><H2> heading 2 <P>
><H3> heading 3 <P>
></H3>
></H2>
></H1>
></BODY>

The validation service responds:
Errors

sgmls: SGML error at -, line 8 at ">":
       H1 end-tag implied by P start-tag; not minimizable
sgmls: SGML error at -, line 9 at ">":

sgmls: SGML error at -, line 16 at ">":
       BODY end-tag ignored: doesn't end any open element (current is HTML)


So first we notice that P is not allowed inside H1. (Sorry if the
error messages are hard to understand. We didn't write that part
of the software, and if we figure out a good way to do it, we'll
make the messages easier to read.)

So if we get rid of the P's:

Errors

sgmls: SGML error at -, line 9 at ">":
       H1 end-tag implied by H2 start-tag; not minimizable
sgmls: SGML error at -, line 10 at ">":
       H2 end-tag implied by H3 start-tag; not minimizable
sgmls: SGML error at -, line 12 at ">":
       H2 end-tag ignored: doesn't end any open element (current is BODY)
sgmls: SGML error at -, line 13 at ">":
       H1 end-tag ignored: doesn't end any open element (current is BODY)
sgmls: SGML error at -, line 16 at ">":
       BODY end-tag ignored: doesn't end any open element (current is HTML)

So we see that you can't nest headings this way.

>vs. (will this appear the same as)
>
><BODY>
><H1> heading1 <P> </H1>
><H2> heading 2 <P> </H2>
><H3> heading 3 <P> </H3>
></BODY>

If we change this to:

<BODY>
<H1> heading1 </H1>
<p>
<H2> heading 2 </H2>
<p>
<H3> heading 3 </H3>
<p>
</BODY>

Then the results are much happier:

I hope this helps!

Paul,

I just thought of another appearent problem with the upgraded TEXTAREA. What if the user wants to send multiple 100MB binary image files?  How would the user put 10 or 20 of them into an upgraded TEXTAREA?  Does the server have to decide for the user exactly how many files the user can send to the server?

I think you may have not understood Paul's suggestion. I believe the
idea is that when the client has a TEXTAREA window there is an option
for the user to type in it as is done now, or pop open a dialog box
to enter the name of a file to send and the content-type.  If you
want to upload 10 or 20 files it is presumably up to you to get them
in an acceptable MIME multipart format.

This seems like something that could realistically happen.  It is 
important to keep in mind that unless the changes called for are
really minimal they just aren't going to happen.  At this point it
is not clear that all (or a majority) of browser writers can be
persuaded to make even minimal changes.

Same thing -- once the document is retrieved, the URL is only used
for resolving embedded relative URLs.

That is a bug.

At most one BASE is allowed, and it can only appear within the HEAD part
of the document.  No ambiguity there, though the spec referred to should
be HTML 2.0.

Some attributes mix better that others. A typical use of "weighted
average" is to soften the author's attempt to be distinct, e.g the
suggested font sizes -- while the user still gets the message. One
doesn't _have_ to use this feature, but while "100%" is equal to a
binary "1" there is no going back from a binary syntax. In general,
I think computer interfaces are much too binary.

On the mixing of colors: yes, sometimes they will not mix too well. If
one specifies own colors, one should probably request dictatorship.

Often, the user needs to override a small number of attributes due to
a handicap, either on the part of equipment ("yuck, helvetica looks
ugly on this machine") or the user (e.g. colorblindness). But throwing
away all the author's style hints due such simple requests is a waste.

No, the author does not know the age of the document since it changes
all the time :-) More on this below.

Probably so. Some of the features of the style sheet language will
primarily be used by authors, others primarily by users. However, I
think it's a sound principle to provide both groups with the same set
of tools. We're all both authors and users, right? This will also
simplify the implementation.

By saying "font.size *= 2" one does not refer to any previous
value. Instead one doubles a factor which is associated with the
attribute. The actual value (i.e. a point or pixel size) is not
determined until the browser has read all style sheets and is ready to
render. Then, the factor is multiplied in with whatever size the
attribute has been associated with.

The grouping of elements is there to make the syntax less
verbose. Would 'h?.align' be better?

There are two issues here. 1) the macro language, 2) server
vs. browser processing.

1) Instead of making all sites invent thir own macro processing
scheme, I think we should put it into the style sheet. This does make
the style sheet syntax/evaluation more complicated, but somebody's got
to do it..

2) A good principle when determining the presentation is that it
should take place as close as possible to the user, both spatially and
temporally, since one there will have more information available.

By enclosing logic in the style sheets, final decisions can be made
closer to the user. Cached style sheets will be more general and can
live longer. Also, this scheme requires no changes on the server side.

Good idea. I'll add it.

Agree, although I think most HTML publishers will use page description
language for the "highest quality".

I like the idea of using ID to specify a particular instance. I'm more
hesitant toward using case to carry information since HTML is
insensitive to case.

I'll start making the list. For some of the more exotic media that one
can support with the current syntax, the list will not be finalized in
a couple of years. Some ideas:

  medium = print | pixmap | screen | speech | tactile |
           print_color | print_bw | print_3D |
           pixmap_color | pixmap_bw | pixmap_gray |
           speech_synthetic | speech_phoneme | speech_diphone |
           braille

  where the top row convenience groups are:

           print = print_color & print_bw & print_3D
           pixmap = pixmap_color & pixmap_bw & pixmap_gray
           screen = pixmap & tty
           speech = speech_synthetic & speech_phoneme & speech_diphone
           tactile = braille & print_3D

For most settings, the unit of measurement would automatically select
the right medium, e.g.:

  strong.weight = 50db   # equals speech.strong.weight = 50 db

Some units, e.g. point size, is used for multiple media (paper and
pixmaps) and would require a distiction.

I gave this a whirl (and discovered a few embarrasing typos which the M-entity
had cheerfully let pass, oops) and found something odd.

It seems that entities must have white space around them.

So If I want MAN-T&EC I have to type

MAN_T &amp; EC not MAN_T&amp;EC otherwise there is an error (EC not declared). 
Does this white space count as markup or as text? 

In other words, would the validated version be rendered in some ideal browser as 
MAN-T&EC or MAN-T & EC

The validation service is great. Is there any way to run it as a standalone 
program? We have SGMLS here but I don't really understand how to make it do 
useful stuff.

PS Dan, why do you always say %7E where other folks use ~ is this something else 
we are all doing wrong?

I think we should use SGML LINK elements as the basis for the style sheet

While we're on the subject of relative URLs I would like to know if
they are allowed in HTTP redirects.  I have not found a browser (though
I haven't tested a lot) which allows a relative URL with a "302 Found"
or "301 Moved" response from a server.  This seems wrong to me, but
the fact that no one seems to support it makes me feel like the only
one in the band marching in step.  What's the story?

Fair enough, but is there a way to allow a document to say..

"In future (e.g. with reload or via hotlists etc) use this
 alternative URL"  ?

which is what Xmosaic (and earlier HTML specs) let you do with
BASE ?

If there is no way to do this, then who do I pester in order to
try to get it into a future HTML spec ?

  Emacs-w3 supports relative links in a redirect, but only because the spec
was unclear about whether it should be a full URL or not.

  From taking a quick peruse through the AIR Mosaic source, it appears that
it will work with relative links in a redirect also, but I can't double
check it right now, since the NCSA server won't allow you to put a
non-fully specified URL in a 'Redirect' statement in the srm.conf file.

yes. You can test this yourself by saving any old HTML page to disk and then 
opening it locally (quickest way on Windows is to drag the file from file 
manager and drop it on top of Mosaic). You'll get a URL like: 
file:///C|/TEMP/PAGE.HTM

John,

Thank you for the clarification.  I am assuming that, when you say: "it is
presumably up to you to get them in an acceptable MIME multipart format", with
"you" you mean the browser implementor, and not the user.

Our original thoughts on file upload were along those lines.  The browser lets
the user select one or more files, and when the user presses the submit button,
the files are put into a MIME multipart format and sent to the server along
with the rest of the form data.  We even have a partial implementation of this.
But we decided to modify the proposal because the new scheme: 1) allows the
server to decide whether it has the resources to accept the files before they
are actually transmitted, and 2) makes backward compatibility easier (it even
allows the file transmission piece to be implemented as an external "viewer"
application; see the proposal for details).

Since I started this thread, I have gotten two inquiries from people wanting to
implement prototypes on two different browsers.  At the moment, I am somewhat
optimistic about the prospects of the proposal.

I appreciate your comments.

Sincerely,

Ernesto

Announcing the HotWired HTML Validator Contest!

First Prize: $100, plus your name and URL on our masthead when we go live 
in two weeks, and our deep gratitude :)

Rules:
	One part of our publication will be a powerful generalized system for
giving feedback to our content and for participating in open discussion
forums.  The system is designed such that the user can write their
contributions in HTML.  The feedback is integrated into the database as soon
as it is submitted, and because some pages will be composites of those, a
generalized mechanism for validating, and *correcting*, any string of text
claiming to be HTML is needed, so that subsequent comments or HTML text that
appears after the submitted text aren't fouled up. 
	
	Again, this parser *must* be able to handle any arbitrary string of 
text - unclosed quotes, any opening tag which does not also have a 
closing tag, etc.  Nothing in the input string can be touched - 
corrections can only be made by adding tags at the end.  Users will be 
able to see how their submitted string renders before approving the post. 

	Source must be provided as a function in Perl, which takes a string
as an argument and returns the fixed string, or as a self-contained C program
that takes input on stdin and outputs on stdout. 

BONUS POINTS:
	Providing source in *both* Perl and C
	Providing a mechanism for error messages, i.e. "You forgot to put
</a> in!\n", etc.

The deadline for the contest is Saturday, October 14th at midnight.  You 
Flex wizards out there should be able to do this in your sleep.  :)
Entries will be judged on correctness and efficiency.

Thanks!

	Brian

file:// and "localhost" are obviously workable for using web-clients as 
from-ends for CD-ROM archives, but what about scripts for searches and the 
like? I'm told that running a server and client on the same machine just 
won't move. Besides, it defeats multiplatform portability of the CD. Any 
ideas on how to implement multiplatform scripting in a serverless local 
environment? (We're doing a fairly extensive multimedia archive of 
industrial archaeology which we want to distribute both on net and 
CD-ROM, making the HTML format obvious, but we lose a lot of 
functionality when we lose the server.)

Subject: Full-text indexing for WWW conference avail.
content-length: 1544

All,

Forgive me if this is too promotional for this list (I hope it isn't).
Like many of you, I expect, we'll have a table at the Web conference in
Chicago, showing our technology.  We have a spider that can index Web
sites, then our server can make that index available via the Web.

I'd be willing to run the spider against a few sites over the next couple
of days to build full-text indexes for people to use during the conference.
We'll put the indexes on one of our servers here at Verity; you'll be able
to search your site here -- the results list will point to the documents on
your server.

I can't make any guarantees about this.  I don't expect any problems, but
this is a technology demo and all of the usual disclaimers apply.  And if a
whole bunch of people want it, I'll have to pick just a few.  I also can't
guarantee that I can keep the indexes updated after next week, but if they
make a good demo, we'll see what we can do.

If you're interested, please send me e-mail.  Our spider is quite simple at
the moment.  All I'll need is a starting URL.  The spider will index all
documents linked to it, recursively, as long as they're below the starting
point in the file structure (this allows us to index just a portion of a
server, based on how you arranged the file structure in addition to the
hypertext links).

The spider will hit your server fairly hard.  We have a real-time indexing
engine and a T-1...

Nick

Is it really best to add another overloaded meaning
to the INPUT element?  How about a new tag:

    <!ELEMENT ATTACH - O EMPTY	-- "Attachment" or "file" input field --

This would leave room for extra attributes that only

The TEXTAREA would serve as a MIME-based multimedia text field.  The  
GUI could vary, but for example, it might allow you to drag-n-drop  
file icons into the field (along with text if you so chose).  Fancier  
GUI's might display the multimedia components non-iconically, but  
that's not essential.  When the FORM is submitted, the files would be  
collected, and the browser would create multipart MIME to encode the  
field's multimedia content.

I think you misunderstand -- the *client* is the one keeping the  
state information in the HIDDEN fields; this has no bearing on the  
statefulness or statelessness of the server.

The current transaction model with HIDDEN fields provides great  
flexibility for application designers to balance the burden of state  
maintenance between the client and the server -- including placing  
the full burden on the client, which is often quite efficient and  
cost-effective.  The scheme you propose would greatly complicate the  
model and preclude the possibility of stateless servers for many  
applications.

[...details deleted...]

Even in this simple example of file submission, there appears to be a  
problem with state.  How does the second CGI script know to which  
author to attribute the incoming manuscript -- and thus, where to  
send the check? :-)  That information was given to a different  
script.  With the various FORM data being fed to the server in  
separate submissions, using separate scripts, how will that data be  
re-coordinated without forcing the server to maintain pending  
transaction records?  And even then, the later scripts must  
apparently be invoked by varying URLs containing a transaction key,  
so that the second script knows which transaction record to look at  
(you can't just key on the file name; what if two authors both submit  
"my_novel.wp"?).

This all becomes much more important for the more complex services  
that people are envisioning based on the ability to perform file  
submission in FORMs.  Stuff like image processing, mathematical  
operations on geometric input, and so on.  In all of these cases, the  
services offered will be highly parameterized, requiring lots of  
multimedia input.  In your scheme, providers of such services do not  
have a choice but to build stateful servers with 2, 3, or more  
cascading scripts all linked into a pending transaction database.

> My main interest is getting file upload into the WWW.

Mine too.  But I would like to jealously guard the relatively clean  
transaction model of HTTP -- I think that's one of its great  
strengths as compared to other interactive services (such as WAIS).

I don't think this is what the HTML specs say (even the early ones),
though I'll admit the wording is somewhat ambiguous.  The intention is
that BASE only effect the parsing of embedded URLs.

Is this an HTML issue or an HTTP issue (I seem to recall a discussion
about allowing the URI: header to be returned on 200 OK responses)?

If you want it in HTML 3.0, pester the people on the www-html mailing
list.  If you want a clarification of the purpose of the BASE element
to appear in HTML 2.0 (unlikely) or 2.1, then pester the people in the
IETF HTML working group -- see

It has always been my impression that only absolute URIs were allowed,
but then I had the same impression about the Referer: field and that one
seems to allow relative URIs (Why? It makes no sense to use relative there).

What would be the benefit of allowing relative URIs in a redirect?
I can imagine they would save space if there were a lot of vary sets,
but would that offset the cost of parsing?  Perhaps.  It certainly makes
more sense to have relative URIs here than it does for Referer.

This is just plain irresponsible.  You are not only affecting their server,
you will also effect every network connection between your site and theirs.
People pay good money for that bandwidth -- you should not attempt to hog it.

Your spider should be running on their local net -- running at your site
provides no added value.  At a minimum, the spider should be forced to
delay between consecutive requests (about 15-30 seconds, depending on the
network throughput and speed of the server).

Well, what you need is a precise algorithm by which a server can
decide whether a particular object is textual or not, so it knows
whether or not to canonicalize line breaks.  Is application/postscript
a textual type, for instance?  application/pdf?  application/rtf?
application/mac-binhex40?

These issues are not totally settled in the MIME community.  The
suggested representation of this information is in mailcap files of
"textualnewlines" as a flag.  I think it'd be great for HTTP servers
to understand this flag (and, more generally, for mailcap mechanisms
to be extended to allow file typing information to be associated with
content-types so that HTTP servers could use mailcap files as a
general mechanism for labeling outgoing files) but I don't expect this
to happen real soon.

There's no need to be rude, it wasn't my decision (nor the decision of
any one individual.)  The spec could be made more clear on this point
(and lots of other points too.)  Mostly, though, it's just that
server authors didn't worry about the issue, and it didn't break
anything, so it wasn't worried about.

Whom exactly are you addressing as "you"?  I didn't write the spec for
HTTP, though I did help write one particular implementation of it.
The people who did are mostly not here.  Bashing the authors of free
software, in a forum which is not the forum in which discussion of the
HTTP protocol normally takes place, is unlikely to elicit good
results.

Your complaint doesn't make much sense.  "binary" is a superset of
"8bit" and "7bit"; the reasons the latter exist is so that content
that may need encoding to get through hostile transport agents is
handled by gateways.  It doesn't make sense in a native binary-clean
environment, which HTTP is.  Other than data possibly passing through
an HTTP-to-mail gateway, what purpose is served by the labeling you
suggest?

I am inclined to agree with you that the MIME version header
could/should be dropped.  HTTP uses MIME content-types, but they've
since been renamed "Internet Media Types" and are used in plenty of
contexts other than email.

This differs from RFC 1521 in several important ways.  MIME doesn't
allow iso-8859-1 to be the default charset, nor does MIME forbid 8bit
CTE for content with no 8bit data (though such is obviously a bad idea
in the context of email from the standpoint of maximizing
interoperability.)  I thought your point was that 1521 should be
followed???

The only substantive point you seem to have is that text should have
its line breaks canonicalized into CRLF instead of being sent out with
UNIX-centric newlines.  On this I agree with you.

>  text/html should be transmitted with <CR><LF> as the line
>  separator.  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit may be used if

Does text/html even allow a "charset" parameter?  Where is this
defined?

>  Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary should not be used in
>  conjunction with text types.

So how should text files that have lines longer than those permitted
by 8bit CTE be sent?  Quoted-printable? :-) Where in RFC 1521 is
sending text with a CTE of binary through a binary-clean transport
forbidden?

Look, you're right that there are several areas where the HTTP
community has sort of wandered away from the way the MIME community
has set up to do things.  Many existing clients' integration with MIME
is bordering on laughable, and some real issues, like line break
canonicalization or handling content-type parameters, haven't been
appropriately addressed.  In other cases, the divergence is quite
reasonable.  MIME's CTE family is intended to work around problems
which simply don't exist in HTTP.

When we at HaL built our CD ROM of abstracts of 10,000 web documents
(with links to the documents themselves, with our OLIAS browser on the
CD-ROM.. ask jps@hal.com for details), we implemented a "spider" that
visited the various sites in an order such that no site was visited
more than once per minute.

It was only a few hours of head-scratching and testing to get it to
work. Vince Taluskie <taluskie@utpapa.ph.utexas.edu> did the
implementation. I'm sure he wouldn't mind helping you out a little.
We already paid him to do it once -- I don't think he'd make you
pay him again for the same info ;-)

Vince consulted the published guidelines[1], I believe. You will not
please the net.folk if you blatantly disregard them.

I've showed the proposal to a couple of people around here, techies and 
nontechies, and they seem to like it, at least from a conceptual level.  
Separating the hardcore presentation information from the semantic 
information is quite nice.  

The syntax may need some work - but to some level that's not as crucial 
to us, as long as we can have whatever web authoring tool we're using 
generate a style sheet whenever we need one from the current settings, 
and as long as they're easy to edit by hand if necessary.  

Important in the browser side would be caching of style sheets from document
to document, of course. 

I wasn't sure if this was in the original proposal, but would there be 
flexibility in where in the document certain styles are applied?  It's 
conceivable that a designer would want his/her <B> tag to be slightly 
different at different places in the same document.  Maybe using
the <a name=""></a> construct to nest the sheets further would be
possible....

As always I'd like to know any details about any new spiders that go
around. What machine do they come from, what User-agent etc...  at
least the net.folk will know what's going on then.

Such attributes play a useful role in HTML as they express the intentions
of authors for particular elements, and can provide the basis for more
sophistocated style sheet mechanisms that exploit richer markup. What is
needed is a way of mapping such attributes into style sheet statements.
A further advantage of these attributes is that they allow you to use
generic style sheets which can be cached effectively. Any overrides on a
per element basis are handled via the attribute values and mapping rules

1. I finally found Daniel Connolly's "aggregate/mixed" MIME type proposal. 
 I think that a "Suggested-Name: " or "Aggregate-Part-Name: " header is also 
needed as a hint to the CGI script as to what to name each aggregate part. 
 (A better name for this header would be nice, too :)...)   The example 
given would then become something like (where lines without leading '>' are 
new):

>        Content-Type: aggregate/mixed
>        Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

with the proviso that "Suggested-Name: " is just a suggestion which may be 
ignored by the CGI script if a name is unnecessary.


2. Ernesto Nebel's proposal for delayed file transmission has this sequence 
of actions:

(1) Browser sends GET request for a form
(message from browser to server)
(2) Server sends back HTML form
(message from server to browser)
(3) Browser user fills out form
(4) Browser POSTs or PUTs it back
(message from browser to server)
(5) Server starts CGI script
(6) CGI script reads and evaluates form
(7) CGI script sends back accept/deny response for file xfer
(message from CGI script to browser)
(8) Browser packs up files and sends them to CGI script
(message from browser to CGI script)
(9) CGI script sends success/failure response to browser
(message from CGI script to browser)

where (1)-(2) is the HTTP GET method and (3)-(9) is the proposed HTTP PUT or 
POST method for file uploads.  Note that the GET method uses a single 
"message" from the browser to the server and a single "message" from the 
server back to the browser.  This number of messages is also the number used 
by present-day PUT and POST scripts.  The requirement of alternating 
multiple messages (4 in (3)-(9)) means the server/CGI script maintain an 
implicit state for the connection, as the connection must either persist 
until after (9) or (7) must pass back a transaction ID for use in (8)-(9). 
 It would seem just as easy for the CGI script to receive the files right 
away, then report back that not all files were transferred via a new status 
code.

The ability in (6) to determine whether there is space available for the 
upcoming files depends on either the ability to preallocate the space for 
the files or unreliable heuristics (as predicting available disk space 
should be at least NP-hard if not NP-complete).

For a solution to this problem, look at Harvest:
	http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/

Why does this help? 

*Distribute Indexing 

Collect all of you index information locally using a "gatherer", then
answer requests for compiling into queryable indices.  Thus, you are only
putting the _index_ over the wire, not the full-text.  Moreover, you are
only transmitting the *changes* to that index, and these changes go in
gzip format. 

*Configurable Indices

Run a local "broker", which goes to various net "gatherers" and builds a
local index of the topics you want.  Or, go to other brokers on the net
that build datasets that interest you. 

*Customized Indices

By selecting the types of info you want (FAQs, HTML files, etc.) and using
filters for these types, you get __structured indices__ for pertinent
info!  Much nicer than full-text indices.  Moreover, write your own
summarizer for new types (IAFA templates, cc:Mail directory listings,
etc.).  Even use the ability to "explode" tar files

*Other interesting subsystems

The Harvest project has other interesting technologies.  For instance, 
using its replication features, you could move the entire object into 
Harvest (i.e. the full text, not just the index) and copy it around, 
with changes being put back in.  There is also an Object Cache with 
strong performance characteristics.  Finally, there is the forthcoming 
Harvest Object System, using object-oriented extensions to define types 
and methods.

Sorry for the verbosity.  The real point is that there is a mechanism to 
dramatically lower the load from indexing, while dramatically raising the 
functionality.

Disclaimer: I am not part of the Harvest Development Team, merely a 
ludicrously-happy beta tester.

If we released our spider, people could build local indexes and then ftp
them here to be served, so that they wouldn't have to have the whole ball
o' wax.  But as I mentioned, it's pre-release software.

We are absolutely NOT releasing this version, precisely because it is
prerelease.  We won't run it against anyone's site without their
permission, which is why I asked, of course.  When we've given it to a
handful of pre-release customers so that they could index their own
servers, we've made sure that they understand what it is, what it does and
why they absolutely must not use it on others' servers without permission.
It is designed to index just one directory tree of one site, so the load it
can create is limited.

We have very intention of building an *ethical* tool for mining information
from the Internet, one that follows the guideless, including limitations on
how often it will hit a particular site.

If someone can tell me how to make our search engine the Internet standard,
then I'll be happy to give everyone on the net the tools to make their own
TOPIC indexes.  But I think the reality is that it's a multi-standard
world, so people will build their own spiders, robots, etc., in order to
get indexes into their own formats.  Perhaps the URI system, when it gets
here, will make the whole process more efficient.

One might notice that for many months, I've had a few pointers to key net
information resources on my server at MCC... among them is a pointer to the
Nexor page on robots.  In other words, we're paying attention, folks.

I think we should all realize that the inevitability of publishers who will
make a living out of creating subject- and discipline-oriented network
indexes, for which they legally don't need the permission of the server
owners.  People have already designed server tools to stop them; gizmos
that lock out a client if it hits a server too often.  I expect that kind
of capability to get built into commercial servers eventually.

Meanwhile, I understand and appreciate the cautions that are expressed
here.  We intend to build very powerful information navigation tools, so we
need to be thoroughly aware of proper design.

	Let me cast this is a more favorable light.  Suppose you have
user validation running (through the server, or throught th form).
You may well want to have per-user limits on dik storage; or, you may
simply be short of disk space.  It would be nice to inform the user of
these facts *before* the start of a 200 Mbytes transfer --
particularly when someone is paying per byte or packet transfered.

	Rough prediction of available space is not hard.  Frequently,
rough predictions are all you need for a production system.

Subject: What if we offered a local spider?
content-length: 1074

The robots discussion that I prompted with my indexing offer gave me an idea.

If we built a free spider that operated only via the file system, which
would build an index mapped to URL-space, then offered to serve those
indexes from here, would people use it?  By not speaking HTTP, this indexer
would be inherently incapable of being used anywhere but locally.

In other words, as was suggested here, you'd maintain your index locally,
then ship it to Verity to be served by our Web server.

Obviously we wouldn't want to burden ourselves with maintaining an index to
the entire net, but we might be willing to do this for free for sites that
are focused on the Web, publishing, libraries, etc. -- especially
educational and non-profit sites.  We're building a "virtual library" of
such information here; this would make it more efficient... although I'm
not sure that I want to have to depend on others to keep the indexes up to
date.  I suppose we could have a spider that would spot check last-modified
dates to make sure that indexes are current...

Thoughts?

Both are 486/100, cyclops with 8mb and hawk with 16.  cyclops will go to

Neither runs anything as fast as some big Sun or whatever, but they are

If you've seen Mosaic Netscape from MCC, 
you'll know why I say the following..

This is the beginning of the end for NCSA Mosaic, which is a shame
since Mosaic was the main reason for the success of the www.

I think many people will now be saying, "thanks, but goodbye NCSA" -
they just took too long to implement the features people requested,
and now they can only play catch-up, and MCC have a huge lead.

Seems like it would depend on obtaining a multi-platform client that did
what you needed.

What server functions are desirable in such a local system - caching and
scripting ?  Are there others of interest ?

I am running the Windows and X versions of Netscape, as well as NCSA 
Mosaic 2.5b2 on X.

I generally agree with the enthusiasm over Netscape.  It is so elegant 
that I catch myself giggling.

However, there are two features in 2.5 that are _major_ and are not 
addressed in Netscape: tables and CCI.  So, I guess on the 
cosmetic/usability front, Netscape is way ahead, and on capabilites, NCSA 
is ahead.

I would like to hear what anyone out there thinks of CCI?  After only 
five minutes my mind was reeling from the implications...

Great -- but in that case, why wait until the submission has started  
to impart that information?  Why not simply include current  
information on resource limits right on the FORM itself?  It would be  
nice for the user to know this *before* putting a lot of time and  
work into creating and gathering the files for submission -- only to  
find out "Sorry, submitted files would exceed resource limits!" after  
the button is pressed.

No, I'm afraid this would not be a point in favor of the proposal's  
elaborate transaction model.

Hold the phones -- 2.5b2 supports multiple submit buttons, as well as a
slew of other things (CCI, tables, kiosk mode, hierarchical HTML hotlists,
and sub/superscripts).

And just when I had begun to lament NCSA ... bite my tongue!

Only if the client sends the `referer:' field in the HTTP request.
Clients built on top of the WWW Library of Common Code has done that

Hello All,
A friend of mine and I are writing a WWW browser.  We are wondering what the
browser sends to the http server when the submit button is pressed for a form?

I personally have worked with processing forms as cgi-bin scripts using method
POST.  And I know that certain variables are set (CONTENT_LENGTH,REQUEST_METHOD,
etc...) and that the variables from the form are passed to the processing 
program through standard input as var=value pairs.

The question is, who sets the CONTENT_LENGTH variables?  The browser or the
server?  Also, how does the browser format the var=value pairs to send to the
http server.

My guess was that it would look like this:
http://host.org.com/cgi-bin/program?var2=value&var2=value

But that doesn't seem to work when I just type it in as a URL to open.

Any help would be appreciated, especially RTFM type comments, as long as the
FM's URL is specified.

Thanx in advance.

Dave Anderson.

PS: I have read a lot of HTML and http docs on the net, but have not found what
I need...

It looks prety nifty.......a very useful feature.

But (at least at this point) some security features seem sorely
lacking.  I couldn't see any way to permission access.....relying on
the assumption that most poeple can't guess my "magic" port is not
something that makes me too comfortabl.

Definitely an interesting idea........you could almost build a proxy
server out of Mosiac 2.5 with CCI.

Free Internet Mosaic Netscape Navigator Available 

MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1994 OCT 13 (NB) -- Mosaic
Communications, a six-month old corporation, headed by Jim Clark,
founder of Silicon Graphics, has announced a beta version of its
Mosaic Netscape free to any individual, academic or research user.

Available immediately, the new Internet navigator features document
interaction before the entire document is downloaded, concurrent
downloading of documents from different servers, and native support
for Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format.

Many users are expected to welcome the capability of working on a
document prior to completing its download. One of the main
complaints with Internet and other online services is the idle time
created while a document is downloaded. Also, the opportunity to
access multiple servers simultaneously promises to further reduce
idle time.

Jim Clark developed the navigator with Mosaic cretor, Marc
Andreessen, who is now vice president at Mosaic Communications. The
company also addressed the always prevalent topic of network
security necessary for commercial transactions. Mosaic Netscape
provides encryption and server authentication which is designed to
pair with Mosaic Netsite Commerce Server, due to be released this
November.

Mosaic Netscape, in its final version, should be ready about the
same time as the Commerce Server. In keeping with the Internet
tradition of free downloads, Mosaic Communications says the final
version will be available on the Net free.

The company says this new navigator is optimized to run on 14,400
bits-per- second (bps) modems and a speed of 10 times that of other
network browsers is predicted. Netscape runs on Windows, Macintosh,
and X Window environments.

Mosaic Netscape is for personal use only. A licensed version for
commercial use is available through Mosaic Communications. The free
beta version may be obtained by anonymous FTP (file transfer
protocol) from the following address: ftp.mcom.com.

Speaking for Mosaic Communications, Rosanne Silino told Newsbytes,
"After taking a good look at the number on PC and Mac users
accessing the 'Net,' we decided there was a great demand for
Internet tools on both platforms. This first release of Netscape is
just a beginning of features we intend to provide. A lot of people
think of a browser as just something to view the World Wide Web.
Mosaic Netscape has been developed as a complete Internet
navigator."

Readers may wonder how a company makes money off of a free
navigator. The company said it has never looked at the navigation
side as a source of profit and its source of revenue is from the
server, support, and services side of the business. 

------------

PS: Note that mcom has just changed the price of its secure
commercial server product from $25K to $5K.

Let's not count anyone out yet, shall we.  If the history of the
Internet (and the Web) illustrates anything, it's the benefits of
open systems and software diversity.  Any thought that one single
commercial entity may gain de facto control of the WWW interface is
scary.  I'm sure marca would agree.

Netscape is a winner, a good demonstration of what experienced
coding from scratch can do for you, but the more the merrier!

	I guess, basically, because printing out a number ("you
have 10Mbytes of free space") and expecting the user to find the
corresponding number for the files to be submitted... is too much
work.  That's the kind of bookkeeping that a lot of users expect the
system to do for them nowadays.

	On the other hand, I myself would prefer to see the free space
ahead of time.  I'll have to retain that idea.

	Per-user limits can keep a single user from consuming
excessive amounts of disk space.  Early detection will reduce the
consumption of excesive communication resources.  Both ways, we are
reducing the potential for denial-of-service attacks.

	In the applications I have in mind, the "good" users are going
to prepare and submit their files anyway; a lack of free space
requires a temporary deferment.  This actually brings me to my next
wish list item:

	Suppose you start a large transfer (this applies to either
upload or download).  If the net is slow, it might take a long time to
complete the transfer.  If the server is buey, it might be difficult
to even open a connection. There should be options for background
transfers, other than just setting the window aside and doing
something else ("clone" during transfer might help); something like
bftp ("bhttp"?) for loading a cache in the server-to-client direction,
and for queuing large jobs in the client-to-server direction.

I have it running fine on an HP 735 workstation (HP-SUX 9.03).

The multi-threaded nature of the beast appeals - getting more than one inline 
image at once, for example. 

Promting for the name of a save-to-disk file while it is being fetched, rather 
than afterwards, is also a clever way to give a percieved increase in 
performance, as is the interlaced display of slowly-loading inline images. Being 
able to interact with, say, a form at the top of the page while inline images 
further down are still being pulled in is also a plus.

The news interaction is excellent. I worry, though, if they have a URL to 
subscribe, unsubscribe, catch up etc from newsgroups does this mean random 
documents can contain these URLs and merrily go writing to your .newsrc?

Are the various extended html tags implementations of HTML 3.0 or are they mcom 
specific extensions (like, for example, the viola-specific extensions)? I would 
appreciate a pointer to a site containing known HTML 3.0 documents especially 
tables, to test out what this puppy can do. The otherwise good documentation is 
rather silent on this point, and if Netscape has 3.0 support you would think 
they would promote it.

Fonts are a pain to customise, you have to brass your way through two or three 
levels of defensive comments in the app-defaults file. A worrying comment says 
not to change things because then content-providers html will not look right. 
Uh? They are encouraging creation of browser specific html?

Pages with multiple inline images all of which have different colourmaps look 
rather better than, say, the M-entity for X (my version has the default number 
of colours to allocate for inline GIFs upped from 50 to 200, yet Netscape still 
looks better). It appears to do some sort of error diffusion dithering. This 
does mean that pages with single, multicolour images (like mcom's home page!!)do 
not look as good as with the M-entity, though. Same with pages where multiple 
inlines are all adjusted to use the same colourmap (for example, all greyscale).

I have yet to test it out on a proper colour system ;-) I have been using an 
8-bit pseudocolour X terminal.

The documentation says something about mcom giving out some specifications to 
help interface it with other programs. This may compensate to some extent for 
the lack of source code.

I will be interested to see what internationalisation support it has: I have a 
feeling there is some in there ;=>

Absolutely.  Which is why we are and will be openly publishing all
new protocols, formats, interfaces, etc. that we happen to develop
in order to satisfy customer demands for new functionality that can't
be addressed with existing protocols/formats/interfaces, and which is
why we're bending over backwards to be fully interoperable with existing
implementations on both the client and server side.  Interoperability
is obviously the lynchpin of this whole environment, and in everyone's
best interest.

Marc

I suggested this to at least one robot author a while ago in the
context of URL checking (Hi Roy :-), but there are a number of
problems: CGI-script generated pages are excluded, access
authorisation is ignored, and you need to parse server config files to
look at URL mappings.

> then offered to serve those indexes from here, would people use it?

Well, by just making the file available on a well-known place anybody
can use locally-generated map. Ehr /ls-R.txt ?

Or rather, you pull it whenever needed.

> Thoughts?

I think the problems identified above are rather non-trivial; and that
a trivial solution may give a significant number of bogus URL's. Even
with a local HTTP robot you have access-permission issues, but at
least you know that correct URL's get out.

This is reassuring, but I'm not sure it goes to the heart of the
objections I've heard to the way the Mozilla extensions to HTML have
been handled.

It would go a long way toward answering those objections if you had
put MozHTML up for public review a month or two ago, and listened to
the comments, rather than releasing it in apparently final form with
no review.  CGI, for one thing, was handled this way, and I think it
wound up better for the public comment on the initial draft.

   Interoperability
   is obviously the lynchpin of this whole environment, and in everyone's
   best interest.

...and, to finish the thought, fragmentation isn't in *anyone's* best
interest.  All the more reason to seek early comment, so at least you
know if there are legitimate needs in some corner of the Web which
could be better handled with an easy change someplace, and which would
drive someone out of the tent if they aren't fulfilled.

I don't mean to disparage the ideas themselves, of course --- for the
most part, they're well thought out, and some of them are long
overdue.  In fact, as long as you're hacking presentation hints
anyway, I would have liked to see support for something like

  <ul type="inline-image" src="/icons/redball.gif">
  <li> some stuff
  <li> more stuff
  <li> red ball image in front of each item
  </ul>

to allow the image-bulleted lists which are showing up everyplace to
be marked up as *lists*, so that authoring systems and text-mode
browsers would have a prayer of handling them intelligently.  I just
think this all could have been handled better politically.

   Cheers,
   Marc

To underscore, emphasize, and concur with these sentiments:  Needing to
attend to market pressures in a timely fashion often means that vendors
pursue proprietary extensions, initially.  That's fine.  The test then is
whether those extensions are put forward for public review and modifiction,
with the vendor's concurrence.

So, Marc:  is MCom planning to submit the enhancements for public review
and adoption?

As I sit here looking at the Netscape HTML enhancements (and think
about the enhancements that other browsers will add, standardized
or not) it seems clear to me that there needs to be a way for my
server and scripts to know not just the type of the browser, but
also the type of HTML it supports (and with what extensions).  In
addition there is now a need (that I'm sure will grow) for an
indication of what type of inline formats are supported (Netscape
adds JPEG (a blessing for modem connections), but structured graphics,
structured text and postscript can't be far behind).

Are there any proposals to this effect?  And where should I be
looking?

I am the editor of an Israeli National standard for the inclusion of Bi 
Directionality into SGML.
The standard is going out now for public comments.
I would like to pursue the avenue of including the same capability in 
HTML, since it is an essential ingredient if one wants to include 
languages with direction of writing of right-to-left.
How shall I proceed?

Absolutely.

I'm not even worried about input-dependent dynamic pages; they can
probably be ignored. However, dynamic pages without input
(e.g. ISINDEX welcome pages) are quite often important, and quite
often don't change at all, or only minimally so. But on a file-system
bot you miss those. In extreme, if you have a server with 30 way-cool
ISINDEX services, you'd be indexed as empty :-)

I agree completely; that's a waste of effort, and a source of problems.

Yeah, but that's just a, ehr, non-trivial problem :-) I believe a
system of index-gatherers can work quite well...

Which requires no state, no connection, and no changes to HTTP.  I think I 
have even seen on the list mention of similar "multiple sequential script" 
schemes in other contexts.  The osmotic pressure of a new idea must not have 
been quite enough to penetrate my thick skull last week :)...

So -- what say you, browser writers?  This capability is a powerful 
extension of the Web.  But it needs to be:  a) added to HTML; and b) coded 
into a browser.  Any takers?

Agreed. Two comments:

1. I stated what I think should be the general principle in
further developing both HTML and HTML style sheets (HSSL?):

	A. semantic & structural information -> HTML
	B. lay out information               -> HSSL
	C. inseparable information           -> ????

Things like <UL WRAP=VERT>, <UL PLAIN>, <TABLE BORDER>, <CAPTION
ALIGN=TOP>, <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>, <P NOWRAP>, etc. should be carefully
analyzed to see if they belong in HTML. For example, I would classify
the above as follows:

	keep in HTML:             remove to HSSL:
        -------------             ---------------
	UL WRAP=VERT              TABLE BORDER
	UL PLAIN                  CAPTION ALIGN=TOP
	P NOWRAP                  H1 ALIGN=CENTER

NB1. <RENDER> should definitely stay in HTML, but I have some doubts
about <HR>.

NB2. For an example of how *not* to do it, look at MCOM-Netscape
(pronounced `Mozilla' :-).

2. Combined with what I wrote earlier about using both GIs and IDs to
refer to elements, we now need a syntax for:

	1. an ID alone
	2. a GI alone
	3. a GI plus one or more attribute/value pairs
	4. (?) one or more attribute/value pairs without a GI

For example:

	ul.above: 12pt                   # Default for all UL elements
	ul[wrap=vert][plain].above: 10pt
	ul[plain].above: 5pt             # For other <UL PLAIN> elements

or, since a GI can also be viewed as an attribute:

	baseline
	  GI=UL
	  WRAP=VERT             : 12pt
	border    ID=p-12       : double
	font.size NOWRAP NOFOLD : 10pt

(Some disambiguating rule is necessary as well.)

The distributed approach requires much more client intelligence to
distribute the query across servers, gather up results and relevancy-rank
them.  Sounds like Z39.50 to me; shall we just add it to the clients?  ;-)

The more likely scenario is that Z39.50 will be added to servers, so that
one server can integrate a number of others.  It's just not going to happen
in the clients any time soon.

1) I contend that textual data (including HTML) is only one type of data to 
be uploaded.  If you look at the sheer volume of data (size of the files), 
graphical data like MPEG movies, CAD drawings, maps, etc. is likely to be 
the majority of the data in use.  Therefore, the file upload widget should 
not just be an upgraded TEXTAREA.  This, of course, is coming from someone 
whose bread'n'butter for 10 years has been CAD software (he says while 
donning asbestos suit...).

2) I can see two distinct scenarios for file uploads.  The first is when the 
user knows the filename (perhaps having copied it to their window system's 
clipboard), so they just want to give the widget the filename.  The other 
scenario is when the exact filename or filenames are not known or easily 
remembered, so a "file open"-type dialog box would be of immense help.  The 
Microsoft Windows Visual C++ tool has a reasonable dialog box for the second 
scenario in its project (collection of files) management toolset.  These 
scenarios imply to me a widget like (in character GUI form):

         +-------------------------+  +---------+
File(s): |                         |  | Open... |
         +-------------------------+  +---------+
(a)      (b)                          (c)

which is a composite widget made up of (a) static text identifying it as a 
file upload widget (text replaceable as needed); (b) a TEXTAREA for the 
first scenario (single known filename); and (c) a button that brings up a 
dialog box for the second scenario.  Although no other HTML widget brings up 
a dialog box, I think that it is justified here so that the capabilities of 
the dialog box are available without necessarily using all the screen space 
needed by the dialog box (which at the very minimum would require 1 edit box 
(current file like (b) above) + 2 listboxes (current directory listing and 
list of files to be uploaded) + 2 buttons (Add and Delete) + associated 
static text).  If drag'n'drop were used to add the files, the listbox for 
files to upload in the dialog box would give the necessary feedback to users 
that they had dragged and dropped the correct files.

3) CGI script code libraries for handling file uploads would be a great help 
(although not absolutely necessary).

4) If file uploads are to be used as the standard mechanism for updating 
documents in a Web, a definition of this standard is needed.

There are probably more issues than these; I just can't think of them at the 
moment.

I apologize if I'm jumping to conclusions, but this
doesn't sound encouraging.  Are you saying that Mosaic
Communications will collaborate with W30, browser
implementors, and the user community *while designing*
new protocols and formats, or are you only saying that
you'll publish them *after* they've been designed (and
implemented, and released to the public [less than a
week before the the spec writers plan on finalizing a
critical Internet RFC])?

Mozilla will undoubtedly take over NCSA Mosaic's "market niche"
(and desevedly so! the application and documentation are 
top-quality).  I just hope it doesn't take over NCSA's 
role of 800-pound gorilla along with it.

This sounds more encouraging.

Hello all --
There is one small problem with Netscapes implementation of news reading &
dealing with the .newsrc.

Other peoples forms can mess with your .newsrc.    Wow.   I can't believe that
mcom did this.  

Take a look at the source on the subscribed newsgroups page.  Now save 
that source & hand it to your httpd.  Now watch the served document do 
your .newsrc funny.

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="newsrc:">

We here at bogus, inc. are interested in knowing a little more about our
customers.  Please fill out the following form:

<DT><INPUT TYPE=checkbox NAME="UNSUBSCRIBE" VALUE="comp.infosystems.www.providers"> (95) I am sexy.
</DL>

<INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE="Tell me about yourself.">

Any one else think this is a bit of a prob??

These are going to be beginner's questions - I read messages from 
this list hoping to learn something, but for now I'm just a computer 
user that accidentaly is producing HTML scripts for a university.

Could anybody please explain to me briefly and like 
I don't know anything about HTML in what way the <BASE> element works?

I know it allows the browser to resolve relative URLs within a document, 
but I still don't feel secure using it. I've been forced to do it in 
order to avoid keeping hundreds of GIFs and HTML documents in one 
directory. However, in a document where I put:

<BASE HREF="www.blah.blah">  - the place where my "index.html" is kept 
.... 
<A HREF="index.html">...</a> - a link back to Home Page

my Mosaic browser returned an error: "failed to locate the host 
index.html". Why? Do I need to specify addresses in full form even though 
the <BASE> is used?

Another problem, this time related to the new Mosaic Corporation browser, 
Netscape: when I use a <BASE> element like above and anchors within one 
document, like:

<A HREF="#section">
....
<A NAME="section">

after clicking on the link it starts looking for a host 
"http://www.blah.blah#section"! This doesn't make any sense to me. Why 
should it treat a reference like #section exactly like a relative path? 
Is it due to Mosaic Corporations' implementation of HTML (I gather 
Mozilla is its name)? The old Mosaic browser has no problems with jumping 
to sections of a document.

And, finally - since I can't help thinking it may be the case that I'm 
simply a long time behind - could you direct me to the freshest HTML and 
HTTP specs?

Thanks for help.

This isn't the place to report problems with netscape. Netscape is a
product of Mosaic Communications Corp. Let's see... netscape says
to report problems to <x_cbug@mcom.com>.

Reporting the problem here:

	(1) doesn't inform the relavent support/development folks
	(2) spreads Fear Uncertainty and Doubt about their products
	(3) wastes bandwidth on this WWW discussion forum

This is not the way I want to see commercial organizations and
products that mean to further WWW treated. [And even if they did't
mean to further WWW, we should let them fail on their own :-]

Now this happens to be a security issue, which makes it that much more
sensitive. Please use the utmost discretion in reporting internet
security problems.

I'm not intimately familiar with conventional wisdom regarding internet
security problem reporting, but here's some info from the Security FAQ:
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/security-faq/faq.html

Q.9 Who can I contact if I get broken into?

If you're connected to the Internet, you should certainly get in touch
with CERT, the Computer Emergency Response Team.

        To quote the official blurb:

I once heard a Microsoft rep state that a certain product would

	"...interoperate with industry standards.  Afterall, Microsoft 
	 makes so many standards, it would only stand to reason that we 
	 would interoperate with them." 

                           -----------------

Seriously though, I see a real danger here.  By adding functionality in
the absence of industry participation, MCC is driving the balkanization
of web. 

Frankly, I freely admit that I was very surprised when I saw Mozilla.  I
was very impressed with the professionalism of the interface and
documentation.  It is intuitive, easy to use, and very aesthetically
pleasing.  So much accomplished in so little time!  My (virtual) hat is
off to Marc and crew.  I was and am VERY impressed. 

Then, I looked at the HTML extensions and was VERY surprised.  I was
surprised to see additions to a defacto standard that had never been
discussed in any forum, to the best of my knowledge -- a half-step
towards stylistic management which offers a little more control over the
presentation of the document, but at what cost? 

Of course, the web-setters WILL embrace the new markup.  It adds some
needed presentational sugar to a diabetic toolset.  But we could have
had full stylesheets offering a more comprehensive control over the
presentation of the document.  And, if there is one thing we have
learned on the Internet, it is that you cannot put the toothpaste back
in the tube, or the packet back up the pipe. 

So now, instead of technology driven by the industry where all
participate and benefit, we see one company driving technology in their
own chosen direction. 

By embracing this markup, we will all be agreeing that MCC writes the
standards and so, drives the World-Wide Web. 

Marc and perhaps more appropriately, Jim Clark, what it appears you are 
doing here is going to damage the web.

Mark,

One other issue is the encoding of the files.  Several similar multipart MIME
encodings were suggested during the past few weeks.  For the first
implementation, all browsers should use the same encoding scheme to facilitate
interoperability.

The BOF meeting on File Upload at the WWW conference is on Wednesday at 6pm.
Hopefully, many issues can be resolved then.

Ernesto

PS: I can't be at the conference, but Larry Masinter will (he worked with me on
the file upload proposal).

companies often have to do that, to meet market schedules.

The test is whether they THEN are willing to submit to community review AND
MODIFICATION.  And this must be done in an open forum, such as an open
standards group.  (I'm biased towards the IETF, but choose any one that is
open and effective.)

Otherwise, the spec is merely a public presentation of a private spec,
under strict vendor control.

I am far less concerned with whether or not they did the right thing
than with how I'm going to support both styles of browsers.  The
benefits of the extensions are hard to ignore, but I have no clean
way of telling whether a browser can support them.

This isn't a problem unique to Netscape.  Table support in NCSA's
2.5 beta results in the same issue.  In fact it's worse,  a table
read in a browser without table support looks like trash.  A
minimal solution would be to modify the web server to check for
the browser type and load an alternative file on the request.
(E.g. when asked for "foo.html" it might give "foo.ehtml" or some
such if the browser supported the extensions used in that file.)
I don't believe that's a good long-term solution, but it ought
to work for the short term.

Any thoughts?

The problem is that 

	accept: text/html

doesn't indicate which version/profile/release/level of "html" you
want. This is a problem for html now, but it's also a problem for 
application/postscript in the face of Postscript level 2, for
image/gif in the face of embedded JPEG in GIF94, or even in the
negotiation over color, black & white, embedded images, etc.

I urge everyone to avoid releasing documents that use non-standard
extensions to HTML *as* HTML. If people want to extend their browsers
to accept some other document type, that would be lovely.

I urge Mosaic Communication Corp to 'fix' Mozilla to include a header:

  accept: text/x-mozilla-html

and to fix their server to label their extended documents in that
form; this would allow servers to conditionally release different
documents depending on the content type, just as the web was
originally designed.

This would is a responsible and compatible way of releasing
experimental and non-standard extensions to HTML in any browser.
Don't call it 'html' until it actually *is* HTML.

If you want to infer that file:///localhost/foo.html is really
content-type text/x-mozilla-html, that's fine, too.

You know, there's good reason to get new features out for experimental
use! It's just that it's really easy to do in a way that is actually
compatible with the standards that are already released.

Well, I know I am probably going to stir up trouble with this e-mail,
but in my past experience the HTML group has not been terribly "open".

They just repeat over and over, "Yes, we admit that hundreds (thousands?)
of people want formatting control, but they are all wrong, and SGML/HTML
is content not format so tough."  So what should I do when the open
standards group insists on a standard that is not what our customers
(the ones who will indirectly be paying my salary) want?

You want me to say, "sorry, I know this isn't what you want, but an open
standards group of which you weren't a part has decided that this is
really for your own good, so please give us money anyway."

Eric, many of the tags in Mozilla-HTML could have been done in HTML 3.0. 
What made you chose <CENTER> over <P ALIGN=CENTER>?  That which could not
have been done in HTML 3.0 could probably have been handled with style
sheets, as Rob Raisch posted about here *months* ago and for which Hoken from
Cern recently posted a great proposal for.  What about one of the most
glaring problems, imagemaps, which HTML 3.0 has a really good solution for? 

Don't play the "we know what's best for you coz we've been talking to real
content providers" trump card - I think we would qualify in that category,
and I know many others in similar positions as myself in the industry, and I
know we aren't interested in storing our data in a data format that a single
company, even the company with the commanding lead in an industry, decided
"was best".  In the bad old days of computing, one had to do that simply
because there often weren't other options, and hardly any such thing as
standards.  Not true anymore.  When you talk about putting thousands, maybe
hundreds of thousands of documents online in a semantic markup format for
structured searching, the content provider isn't really interested in a
language that could change by the whims of a particular company.

I understand your predicament - it's dangerous to follow moving-target
proposed standards like HTML 3.0, especially when you're confident that you
could transparently add some new tags and make everyone happy.  But as
browser implementers you could have provided the push to get out of the
chicken-and-egg syndrome and implement HTML 3.0, and you blew it.  

I won't say any more than has been said on usenet already.  But strike me 
in as concurring with Rob Raisch, and concurring with text/x-mozilla-html.

You know, mcom has just released a kicking browser to the web community for
FREE. A good application doesn't just appear out of nowhere. It takes time,
effort, and money. Yeah, yeah, I know we all could have put together a
beautiful browser that's twice as good as Mozilla if we only had the
money/time/inclination. But we didn't and they did and they released it for
free.

I think its reasonable for mcom to claim as payment control over the
protocols used by Netscape. The fact of the matter is that mcom would
be perfectly justified in setting the standards de facto, and using
this control to take over the commercial web server business.

Everybody here ought to be thanking them for NOT taking that attitude,
and for being nice about it.

Its not showing up at standard setting meetings that entitles you
to set standards, its writing code that implements them.

The old NCSA team joined marca on May 5th. All of the design and coding
happened after that.

I dont. 

With the existing www-talk (and hopefully W3O), we will have _open_
protocols. Ones that _everyone_ can decide on. Yes, this often means
nothing gets done, until someone sits down, writes something up, then
everyone mangles it until something workable comes out the end.

MCOM have done a fantastic job with Mozilla, and they are to be
congratulated on the speed of the work. However, this should not allow
them to claim 'the protocols used by Netscape'. If they wish to do this,
call it something other than HTML. We all use HTML, not just MCOM and
their clients.

Open protocols. Not a single-vendor-dictated one.

Of course, if MCOM are intending to allow input into their MHTML
(x-mozilla-html is too much of a mouthful for day-to-day use) then
ignore this post. :)

As I understand it the <base> element is used to specify the URL of the
document it occurs in. This allows it's "real" location to be found when
the document is read out of context. Any partial URLs are read within
the document are read relative to this URL.

That is not a full URL. It should be something like:

    <base href="http://www.blah.blah/">

> <A HREF="index.html">...</a> - a link back to Home Page
>

The above should work if you specify the base URL fully.

I imagine this is because the "#section" is a partial URL which is
always relative to the URL of the current document. You have redefined
it as "www.blah.blah" so it's trying to find the document in that.

Hope this is clear.

I would be somewhat more convinced by this argument if mcom had made
extension that showed an understanding of the *deep* problems rather
than the superficial ones. The extra tags added could very well come
back and bite everyone in precisely the way that the original HTML
did: by putting style information directly into the structure of a
document (remember, why is <P> as a container for text better than <P>
as a paragraph seperator?). As someone else has already pointed out,
HML 3.0 and stylesheets are going to solve most of these problems.

While I am loath to point to it, you should look at DynaText(tm) to
see what SGML and stylesheets can accomplish before inventing another
LaTeX. It shows both the benefits of stylesheet based viewing, and of
structured searches based on SGML tags. 

Another vote for text/x-mozilla-html.

BTW. I'm still not sure why everyone is raving over Mozilla....

PS. Is anyone other than me interested in using TEI path names as a
subdocument addressing scheme for URL's pointing to SGML documents?

Not so fast... this is not FREE in the typical internet sense of the
word "free" -- the vast majority of the intellectual property
developed at Mcom is still inside Mcom. What we got was a few
megabytes of binaries to play with.

Nobody else can patch, enhance, maintain, etc. that code. They didn't
give away much, in the large scheme of things.

Time will tell if they are willing to "give away" as much support as,
say, NCSA or UKansas or CERN has given. It wouldn't make good business
sense to do so, if you ask me.

I don't mean to complain, just to clarify. If the beta release of
netscape solves problems for you, so much the better. But it doesn't
get me anywhere I couldn't get before. (Now if there were a Linux
version that worked over term... :-)

>I think its reasonable for mcom to claim as payment control over the

If they did that, they had better not call it HTML or WWW. They
can take their marbles and play elsewhere, sure. But I don't think
that's in anybody's best interest.

> The fact of the matter is that mcom would

I strongly disagree. Mcom diserves credit for quick turn-around for
what looks like a nice product. But they didn't invent WWW, and they
don't own it.

TimBL conceived of WWW, but the original ideas have been around for
years: look at Ted Nelson, Charles Englebart, and the rest of the
HyperMedia researchers, plus the internet researchers, and the list
goes on and on. Had all these folks done their research behind closed
doors, Mosaic never would have existed.

>Its not showing up at standard setting meetings that entitles you
>to set standards, its writing code that implements them.

I think this is a short-sighted viewpoint. Implementations come and
go. Specifications -- good ones anyway -- stick around. Look at
RFC822. How many implementations do you suppose there have been?
Do you suppose we've seen the last one?

You don't _have_ to squeeze all the features into HTML. You can
make up other document formats, if folks want page layout etc.

It's not so much that formatting control is "wrong," but that it
is meaningless in some contexts, and it does more harm than good
to let authors think that they can use some idiom to express their
ideas when in fact that idiom will be lost in translation.

Before making a change to HTML, it's wise to ask questions like: how
does this translate to ASCII? To braille? Should this feature be
provided as is, or made more general to solve a much larger set of
problems for marginally more cost?

The "right" answer for your customer base might not be the same as the
"right" answer for 90% of the folks that use HTML. (I've been at a
start-up company, and I've seen how time-to-market affects the
decision making process. It's not pretty :-{ )

It's clear that Adobe PDF is hitting the web. It's a solution to
many problems. That's one way to go.

I think it's time to admit that RTF is a solution to another
interesting class of problems, and support that format where
applicable.  Lord knows there's a lot more software for creating RTF
than HTML (though the interoperability of such software is pretty
suspect...).

Isn't there some working group looking at "net-RTF," i.e. some
interoperable subset of RTF?

Or, if you don't like RTF per se, have a look at a representation
of RTF semantics in SGML -- the Rainbow DTD from EBT and contributors:

	ftp://ftp.ebt.com/pub/nv/dtd/rainbow

An RTF display window with configurable mappings from HTML->RTF would
be a powerful architecture.

Another option is the Semantic Delivery Language (SDL) used in
HP Help (aka CDE Help).

Or call it text/x-mozilla-html.

But please don't call it HTML without public review.

The table support is less of a problem; at least it forms part of an
established standard-in-progress (HTML 3.0). Other browser writers 
can make software that understands the same markup without having to 
guess at the full spec from a few examples.

However, yes, how does a client tell the server "I understand HTML 3.0" 
or, more tricky, "I understand tables inline JPEG and this-bit but not 
that-bit"

How should we serve HTML 3 to the Web? Is it still text/html ? Should 
the same URL point to two different versions using server-side trickery?

Things seem to be getting a little stressed out here- would everybody 
like to sit down and work out what's getting people upset? Mosaic 
Communications has released a new browser which supports some extra tags, 
as well as the basic set. Nobody has to use those tags in their source 
material; conversely, everybody is free to implement those extensions in 
their own software if they thing they're a good idea. 

Remember, the Internet is a glorious experiment - if we don't try new 
things, we'll never find out if they work or not (I find blink to be 
useless without being able to control the strobe rate). It's happened 
before- NCSA added the IMG tag to the orignal HTML. People liked it, and 
it spread. 

If people don't adopt the new tags, then MCC has wasted several gallons 
of programmer time which they could have spent on something else - if 
people do adopt them, then the web is a better place.

This moment of global harmony was brought to you by MDMA - the server for 
generation X

You really don't understand commercial enterprises, then, do you? Which is

Citing RFC822 as a "good specification" is laughable. Its still there 
because is ubiquitous - I think it would be easier to propose a 9-bit byte, 
or a 3-state bit, then to propose dumping 822. So, instead, we keep tacking 
on to it.

The best, and longest lasting, standards are those which are retro-written: 
they take cognizance of what works in the real world and institutionalize 
it. In the process, some things which were tried, and failed, are dropped. 
Creating standards with no real world use beforehand gives us nonsense like

This is an old problem.  Eight or nine years ago this battle was
being fought over user-interface design tools.  I'd say formatting
won there.  

There's no question that format independence gives you a lot of
portability and flexibility.  However web-page construction is in the
end a design art just like page-layout or graphic-design work. It's no
longer just document transferal and portable formats.  And if you talk
to professional designers you will find that they *don't* enjoy saying
to the client, "Well, it'll look like this if you use this revision of
this software, but on that software it may look different, and over
there it may look different again." They are designing an image, and
they have a definite idea of how it should look.  The more format
independence you put in, the more difficult you make their job.

On a slightly related note, someone asked what the big deal about 
Netscape was.  The biggest deal for me was not having to explain
over and over to my clients that the problems they were seeing were
specific to their particular version of the NCSA browser (usually
on the PC) and there was nothing I could do about them.  It's clear
that Netscape has a much larger set of common code between platforms.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept

A few thoughts.

Using a different type is not sufficient, as you say, different
browsers will add different pieces.  Inline jpeg is a prime example,
but that can be addressed in a different manner.

I'm new to this discussion group, I've been writing HTML for almost
a year, but I only recently broke away from my previous job to do this
full time - my apologies if I'm treading on previoiusly discussed
territory.

I think we need the following:

o  Accept-inline:
That should handle the issue of inline jpeg, as well as future
possibilities such as structured graphics, postscript, epsf and rtf.

o  A version flag somewhere in the protocol
This is a MIME problem really, and I used to get in arguments over it
when that standard was being written and I was writing email software
in a previous life. This could just be for the HTML, but it sure would
be nice if you could tag every type you recognized with a version. 

o  An extensions specification.
This is most important for the HTML, although again it could apply
to other types.  I guess what makes most sense to me here is that
anyone who comes up with a new revision of HTML subdivides it into
portions that they think it is likely or reasonable that someone
might implement in part.  So if we thought of Mozilla's HTML as
being a full revision, then they might split off the image alignment
attributes into one extension part, mailto into another, and bundle
the rest.  So then you might have a browser that supported (this
isn't a syntax, it's a concept) HTML/2.0+IMG_ALIGN/1.0+MAILTO/1.0

That's all find and dandy, and it's clearly helpful to your CGI
scripts, but it doesn't really do much otherwise.  So now you need
to think about server smarts.

I would argue that the server needs to be able to do multiple files
for a URL already.  I would love to store all my non-inlined images
in JPEG format, and if I get a request from a user who doesn't have
JPEG support. I would send them the GIF version (maybe even built
on the fly and then cached).  Ditto for inline images.  This is
kind of multi-part alternative where I send them the right alternative
and just that alternative.

Given that ability, it would be relatively straightforward to have
alternative HTML files as well.  The server config could indicate
which file ending refered to which extensions, and then it could
choose the best fit.

Multiple files is a pain for the web site developer though.  An
alternative would be to allow conditional code in a parsed HTML
file.  If the processing demands are too high you could either
manually preprocess the file, or parse it once on first request
and cache the resulting alternative.

None of those options are very pretty.  I'll be very interested to
see if any of the forthcoming commercial servers attempt to deal 
with any of these problems.

P.S.  My last message to this list somehow had all the Mime headers
duplicated, which made it impossible for me to read, and apparently
crashed a few mime mail applications.  Hopefully this one won't do
the same.  If anyone has any clues, please let me know.

I've only been in the industry for 4 years, but I think I understand
a few things. I didn't say I expected them to release source. It wouldn't
make good business sense. I just don't think anyone should get the
impression that Mcom committed some great act of altruism by sticking
some binaries on an ftp server.

Consider the alternative: Spyglass has committed to sibmitting its
libwww patches back to the maintainers, for all to use.

>What, not even "a few megabytes of binaries to play with"?

Check out ftp.halsoft.com: you won't find olias binaries, because we
don't think they'd be useful to folks without some other tools.  But
you will find binaries for ishmail, a supported product of HaL
Software Systems. We're taking advantage of a cheap distribution
mechanism just like they are.

It makes a lot of sense: if Joe User can ftp the software, then he's
already got a clue and a working TCP/IP stack, or he got the software
from somebody who does. That eliminates 60% of the support hassles right
there.

I agree with this but does it belong in the browser?  The document
can have a link to an application helper, written in VB or Applescript or
perl, that would handle the task.  We've been working with this
concept for our MIS application.  The use of the http protocol
outside the standard server/browsers programs hasn't been discussed
much here.  For database applications integrated with the web, we've
found that writing mini-webclient modules for Excel is a hit with
users.  With implementors too because we don't have to write
input form for users.

It would be great if we could hash this out once and for all, and
deploy the solution.

Format negociation is this nifty idea in theory, but in practice, we see:

	"Click _here_ if you have a text-only browser."
	"Click _here_ if you don't have a forms-capable browser."
	"Click _here_ for postscript, _here_ for text..."

[First, I wish all the _here_'s would go away, but that's another
story altogether.]

I'd actually say that the Mcom extensions are less worrisome than tables:
if a document uses Mcom extensions, it still makes sense in existing
browsers. It looks like they were fairly careful about that.

On the other hand, if a server hands a table to a browser with no
table handling code, you get something like:

	This table shows population growth: USA USSR 1000 3324
	1985 1986

where the table contents gets streamed into the paragraph.

Ideally, the server would convert the table to PRE or some such.

But I don't think the technical details are the problem any more:
we have to make it easy for information providers to _use_ format
negociation.

I don't know if this means more tutorial documentation, or some
http server configuration options, or changes to clients, or what.

I have a few ideas, but I'd like to hear from other folks: how can
we clean this mess up? Or is format negociation just not gonna work?

What can we do to avoid:

	"Click _here_ if your browser doesn't support tables."
	"Click _here_ if your browser doesn't support multilingual docs."
	"Click _here_ if your browser doesn't support figures."
	"Click _here_ if your browser doesn't support math."
	"Click _here_ if your browser doesn't support stylesheets."

Let's remind ourselves of a few things before we go on:

	o  WWW does NOT equal HTML
	o  WWW (thru HTTP, FTP, gopher) allows the abiltity to provide
	   all types of data: images, video, audio, text, etc, and yes,
	   HTML.

HTML was designed to allow information providers using the WWW to
serve hypertext documents easily w/o learning a complex markup
language.

Now, for those who like complete control in how their documents will
look, then use PostScript (or some other language) that will serve your
needs.  Nothing is stopping WWW clients from directly supporting
PostScript or other page description languages.  So, instead of
'bastardizing' a language that people tend to forget what its intent
is, use another launguage.  Remember, HTML is ONLY one of the many
content-types that the HTTP protocal (WWW) supports.  You have a
choice.

I'm not advocating that HTML stay static.  I welcome enhancements to
HTML that improve it as a markup language, but HTML is (will be) a
standard.  And changes to it should be officially approved.  You don't
see people make arbitary changes other standards:  ANSI C,
MIME, TCP/IP, etc, just to suit a particular need:  "Oh, people
have been demanding set operations, like Pascal, in C, so I decided
to add the support to our compiler."

Standards serve a purpose: interoperablility.  If you are not
satisified with HTML, choose something else.  It's not like there are
no other document description languages available.


>I want my document to look the way *I* designed it.

Then don't use HTML.  HTML is structured language that allows some
formatting hints (more formatting markup exists in HTML+).  The beauty
of HTML, is that it is simple (compared to other document description
languages) to render and leaves all the tough descisions about fonts,
color, etc, to the client (which makes HTML documents small and 
less time to transmit).  Since WWW connects machines of all types, HTML
allows quick and easy dissemination of information.

	--ewh


P.S.  BTW, nothing prevents one using SGML as a typesetting markup
language.  However, since such languages already exist (PostScript,
TeX), it is not normally used for such a purpose.

Hah. They *gained* a lot from this. This is roughly equivalent to
dumping: put something good out there dirt cheap, kill the
competition, establish oneself as *the* place to go, and then start
charging a "reasonable" amount. Also, if a large number of people use
the free browser, then it is in the interest of businesses to supply
their people with the same tool to avoid training costs. Any fool can
see that this is also being justified by the $ on the bottom line.
*That* is business. 

One thing you should remember: the WWW is potentially going to develop
into something vast, and something all-pervasive. Even a small step
wrong now could cause a lot of trouble later. While a clear separation
of style and structure causes short term difficulties due to immature
technology at the browser and protocol levels, in the long run, the
benefits will be enormous. We need to deal with information as
information, not as images (though display is also important). Adding
tags whose only purpose is to produce some visual, and GUI specific
effect, is not the way to go.

Ummm.   Thanks, we appreciate your support.  But please, even in jest,
saying that we are trying to "control" the protocols is just dumping 
gasoline on the fire.

We are not not not not not trying to control anything.  If you don't like
the new HTML elements, fine, don't use them.  I don't mind.  If you are
one of the people that wanted these new tags and asked for them, and you are
now unhappy with them. please please please let me know.

No, since the inline request is done seperately, you just need to use a
different Accept header for that request.  You don't need any new
headers.

This can be done at the moment: our server has been doing this for over
a year now, and it works for everything (except WinMosaic, which is a
bit broken in this respect).  No new magic is needed, you just have to
use a server which supports multiple types and configure it up properly.
 This is the whole purpose of the Accept headers (well, there may be
other reasons, but who cares :), and it allows you to even convert the
images into the correct format on the fly (we had this enabled in our
server for a while, and it kept converting gif's into ascii art on
terminal interfaces. Yuck :)

Hi Folks,

Does anyone know if there is an archive kept of the MBONE broadcasts
of the World Wide Web conference currently happening in Chicago? The
local broadcast site was not open at 6:30 AM this morning to
show the "Welcome" address of the conference.

Please send any responses to this email address, since I'm

Subject: Netscape, HTML, and Designers
content-length: 4039

Hi,

I'd like to make a few comment from this graphic designer's perspective.

I understand and appreciate that HTML is intended for _logical structure_
markup. It seems to me, though, that more and more Web sites are being set
up as if HTML were being used to do _page layout_ markup. As a designer,
the latter is how I'm accustomed to presenting information on a printed
page, and I'm sure many other designers would take the same approach.

And , as a designer, I am _not_ merely trying to leave my fingerprints all
over a document for ego reasons. Designers have a role to play in the
presentation of information, and I think the decisions I make regarding a
layout do enhance to flow of information from author to consumer. More
importantly, my clients think so to. And they want to know that what I've
designed for them will be presented in a consistant way that makes them
look good.

Having said that, it's clear to me (and probably everyone else on www-talk)
that HTML is not, and should not become, a language for doing page layout.

I think that part of the problem might be that there is a lack of
understanding of what HTML is intended to be. That certainly was the case
for me. When I first started to look for information on HTML this past
summer, I had a hard time finding definitive, hard information on
constructing Web documents. There was lots of info to choose from, but it
took some time to assemble and sift through it all. I think I'm the wiser
for it, but took a while to find everything (and I still haven't found a
text/postscript file with the HTML+/HTML 3 spec). Then I had to find tools
that would let me do at least some of the coding automatically, rather than
all by hand, and hope that the code generated by the tools was legal. I'm
still not 100% confident in my ability to create wonderful, legal, Web
pages (umm... don't tell my clients).

While I like to think I'm an industrious fellow, I'm often too lazy to make
that sort of effort, or I have too many other things to do, or something.

I could be wrong on this, but I expect that if an authorative-_sounding_
company says to the design community "we have a product that will let you
painlessly do Web page design using a tool that feels and works like
PageMaker or QuarkXpress", then there are going to be some injuries in the
ensuing stampede of designers to that company's doorstep. If that company's
product has incorporated many critical (from a designer's perspective)
capabilities that also happen to be conceptually flawed from an HTML
perspective, well those designers will, for the most part, probably use
those features anyway.

It's a very real possibility that HTML will mutate into a language for
doing page layout.

For those of you who want to preserve HTML, there are some steps that need
to be taken:

1) Understand who your "opponent" in this "conflict" is. NetScape isn't an
authoring tool. It's a browser. There won't be any bad HTML to browse if no
one creates it.

2) Find a way to explain to designers, in terms that they (we) understand,
what HTML is, what its uses are, and why it is not to be treated as a page
layout language.

3) Develop a way to provide designers with the ability to do _page layout_
on the Web so that we won't need to hammer away at HTML to force it do what
we _think_ it should do.

4) Make the process happen faster. For better or worse, designers have
become used to the reasonably quick response to their needs that commercial
software vendors provide. While it may be unfair, some won't wait for
official standards to be established if a company comes out with off-spec
solutions to designers' problems. Postscript is Adobe's de facto standard
for page layout in the publishing industry. Designers don't seem to mind de
facto standards.

I don't know if any of this helps, or is appropriate.

Am I off base with any of this?

Here's somethings off the top of my head; I'm still not sure if
it is 'good' SGML, but SGML seems not to handle dynamic conditions
in a clean way:


1.  Marked Sections
-------------------

Clients by default can define the following types of general entities:

	HTML.Level0
	HTML.Level1
	HTML.Level2
	HTML.Level3
	...

For example, a level 2 comforming client would imply the following
declarations:

	<!ENTITY HTML.Level0 'INCLUDE'>
	<!ENTITY HTML.Level1 'INCLUDE'>
	<!ENTITY HTML.Level2 'INCLUDE'>

Then a document writer can use the following constructs:

    <p>Blah blah blah

    <![ &HTML.Level2; [
	    <!-- Whatever level 2 stuff in here -->
    ]]>
    <![ &HTML.Level3; [
	    <!-- Whatever level 3 stuff in here -->
    ]]>

To provide alternatives for the same data.

If a client discovers a entity reference as the status-keyword and the
entity is not defined (like HTML.Level3 for level 2 or lower clients)
the replacement value 'IGNORE' is used.


2.  Processing instructions
---------------------------

Processing instructions could be used to inform the client on different
levels of HTML being used in a document.  For example:

    <?level=2>
    <!-- Level 2 (and lower) markup here -->

    <?level=3>
    <!-- Level 3 (and lower) markup here -->

    <?level=2>
    <!-- Switch back -->

The client can send a warning to the user when higher level
instructions are specified that is not directly supported by the
client.  The default level can be implied by the <!doctype declaration,
or if not defined, the highest level supported by the client.

Of course, there are inherent disadvantages to using processing
instructions, and this seems a little ugly to me.


3.  New HTML elements
---------------------

Add new elements to HTML like the following:

	<!ELEMENT ALTERNATE - - (PART)+ >
	<!ELEMENT PART      - - ANY     -(HTML|HEAD|BODY) >
	<!ATTLIST PART
		  level NUTOKEN #IMPLIED >

As you might guess, it is somthing similiar to a multipart/alternative
MIME message.  Example of usage:

    <alternate>
    <part level=2>
	    <!-- level 2 markup -->
    </part>
    <part level=3>
	    <!-- level 3 markup -->
    </part>
    </alternate>


Clients will choose the markup that is contained in the highest level
part to render.



4.  The CONCUR construct
------------------------

The CONCUR feature of SGML can be used to handle alternate views.  I'm
not to knowledgable/experienced on the CONCUR feature of SGML, so I'm
unsure if it can solve the problem.  Plus, I think it would be awkward
for authors to use.

To me, file upload is such a natural and useful functional extension
to browsers, that it would be a shame if the mechanism to do it were
agreed upon (define additional InputType of FILE in HTML, as proposed
by Ernesto Nebel) and it were *not* supported by browsers.

Why complicate the picture by requiring users to download and install
additional helper apps, and worry about who supports them?  Yes, helper
apps will be required for specific applications, but I think uploading
files is a fairly generic function with wide appeal.

My point exactly -- except I was trying to emphasize what this

Call it a MIMEAREA, if you like.  But the file sizes are not relevant  
-- the MIMEAREA doesn't actually have to actually display or even  
load the contents of the files.  It could, for example, simply  
contain icons representing the files.  The contents of the files only  
need to be handled when the form is submitted.

As for the exact GUI, perhaps we should look at MIME-based mail  
programs, which presumably have already found good interface  
metaphors for composing multimedia documents for transmission.   
NeXT's mail program, for example, uses a simple drag-n-drop metaphor.

You are brushing the server-side changes -- exactly the part of  
Ernesto's proposal that I find most troublesome -- under the rug.

His proposal places new constraints (statefulness) on HTTP servers,  
and adds new complexity (cascading transactions) to them as well.  It  
changes the semantics of HTTP for, as far as I can see, no solid  
reason.  I feel that this will be cause for much regret down the  
road.

Fortunately, the encoding discussion is part of either proposal.  But  
what I'm advocating requires no other changes on the server end.  We  
need to keep server design as simple as possible, in order to open up  
the role of information provider to the largest number of people.

First we need some way for clients to say what they support - accept 
text/html is too broad a brush - and have this published so everyone 
does it the same way. 

Either that, or we insist that clients deploy the full feature set, 
ie all existing clients must support all of HTML 2, future clients 
that support HTML 3 must support all of it. I think this second 
solution is unworkable.

Next, there must be some method in the two most popular servers 
(CERN and NCSA) that does something useful with this information, as 
standard, right out of the box. 

Ideally this could be configured so if you have loads of disk space 
but cycles are tight, the server stores multiple versions of a 
document; if you are short on disk but have a zippy CPU it down 
converts from HTML 3 to 2 each time.

Exactly what the server should do is up in the air right now. But at 
the end of the day what we want to achieve (IMHO) is clearly this: 

1) it is easy for someone to put a document that uses HTML 3 
features onto a server

2) it is easy for someone with an HTML 2 browser to read a version 
of that document.

Clearly, the down-conversion must be done by software on the server 
side because the document author needs to maintain only one master 
document, not a whole bunch of versions, and if the clients knew 
enough to convert 3 to 2 they would be the best part of the way 
towards being 3 clients anyway.

As a result, there will be a big increase in HTML 3 documents on the 
Web - because putting them there will not break existing clients.

Therefore, clients will support more 3.0 features because the 
servers will be able to serve it to them. We need clients with 3.0 
features so that the spec can be tested out in practice, argued 
about, etc. Speaking of which is Dave Raggett's HP browser available 
for alpha yet? I have a nice 735 workstation it could go on ...

The biggest problem, as I see it, is figuring out what a server side 
program should do to a 3 document to down-convert or simulate each 
of the 3 features.

The simplest solution is clearly to remove the information. 

It might be possible to strip out the table information, render it 
on the server side, create a bitmap and then create a munged 
2-compatible document with the inline bitmap. This requires some 
cycles, sure, but if it is only done once when a document is added, 
by a program that comes with the server as standard, it should not 
be too much trouble for authors to do. Perhaps the server could 
invoke the conversion the first time the document is requested and 
squirrel away the munged file transparently.

I agree we must do our utmost to avoid this situation.

And yes, once all this is in place we need tutorial diocumentation 
on how to use the 3.0 features and how to serve 3.0 documents. I 
will help write this documentation once there is something to 
document (I am a technical author in my day job ;-) )

I have been using it (with mixed success) in CGI scripts which need
to reference files (usually inline images) in the context from which
they were referenced.  That means that they get passed a URL which
they use as their <base>.  

I say with mixed success because some viewers (NCSA PC viewers and
I think MacWeb) don't seem to work properly with this.  It also
means that if you do a reload you don't get what you expect.

Does anyone have any other thoughts on dealing with this kind of
problem?

I'm raving about Mozilla because it has the same features on all
platforms, and is *stable* on all platforms.  This is important for
us, where we're trying to use WWW as our CWIS platform.  I hate having
to tell people ``sorry, you can't use this stuff because it isn't
supported on WinWeb'' or ``sorry, I can't do anything about how
unstable your browser is, that's life''.

The problem, as I see it, is that companies are bringing in (or turning to) 
page_designers for web documents. Its perhaps unfortunate that the term 
'page' was used to describe the basic unit of web 'deliverable'. It really 
isn't a 'page' as the layout folks understand the term - a very static piece 
of paper which will always have the same size and structure, appear in the 
same colors, fonts, etc. There's a new paradigm, a dynamic page, 
configurable by the user for his convenience. Imagine, for a moment, that 
you can push a button, and your Wall Stret Journal is now a tabloid, for 
easier reading on the subway. Or your Reader's Digest is now 11 X 14, with 
bigger fonts because your eyes don't work as well as they did 20 years ago.

There's no reason why the *concept* can't be delivered so that the emphasis, 
flow and _style_ were still present, even on a dynamic page. But the 
designer needs to re-think the design.

Companies that make the paradigm shift will gain the gratitude (and 
business) of the public; those that don't, won't. Very similar to the 
automobile business during the seventies, when the Japanese gave the 
consumer the product that the public wanted, while Detroit still tried to do 
it "the way its always been done".

Absolutely.  And it needs to get specified soon,

How about parameters on the Accept: header?

    User-Agent: NCSA-Mosaic/2.5
    Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg,
	text/html; tables=yes; forms=yes; images=yes,
	audio/basic

(I *think* that's the right semicolon/comma precedence.)

This should require a minimal change to browsers,
as the HTML features supported by a browser are
more or less fixed.

Classifying things by feature will probably be more useful
than defining HTML levels for this purpose.

On the server side, the GET processing module could
pipe all HTML documents through a CGI filter that
selectively downgrades the document to eliminate
features that the browser doesn't support,
either replacing them with <PRE> (e.g., tables)
or a canned message saying that this part of the
document could not be viewed.

Any unlisted features should be assumed unsupported.

Accept: text/html with no parameters, or no
Accept: headers at all, could be interpreted to
mean "Send the document as-is."  This would be
most useful for spiders and site indexers that are not
feature-dependant.  (And curious users with older
browsers.)

(Thirty or forty Accept: headers with no quality parameters,
followed by Accept: */*, could be interpreted as a
request for a MIME multipart/alternative message (in
base64) containing a separate copy of the requested
document in every listed format which the server is
able to generate :-)


Plexus and CERN httpd have customizable hooks for GET
processing; it could be hacked into NCSA httpd by augmenting
the server-side include mechanism.  Don't know about any others.

I think the only requirements here are:

    * W30 or HTML-WG publishes an initial canonical HTML feature list;
    * Browser authors send a suitable Accept: text/html header;
    * Someone writes the CGI filter (second toughest part);
    * Server maintainers install it at their discretion;
    * Authors write more-or-less proper HTML, (i.e., it has to be
      parseable by tools other than their favorite browser).

I thought MIME already supported a versioning parameter?
Can't we use that:
     Content-type:  text/html; version=2.0

In accept:
     Accept: text/html; version=2.0, image/gif; version=89

Servers can then ignore or deal with the clients request as
they feel like - maaaaybe you get a conversion, maaaaybe not.

Alternatively:
The browsers send a list of all tags that they support
and then have the servers strip out or convert stuff the client
can't deal with.  (Or you will end up with long long lsts
of what each client can and cannot support).
Ask Brian at Wired about his happy maintenance of browser capability
lists...  It's no fun for the administrators.

On the other hand, why not have the server send along a list of
what the tags mean and suggestions on how to render them?
You know: like a DTD and stylesheet?

[ ;-) for the sarcasm impaired. ]

Of course, this means there has to be a mapping from the
DTD to a set of browser features: <BR> means new line. 
So does <P> - what about tables?  Can one specify a mapping
from the table DTD to some set of browser rendering hints?

> invoke the conversion the first time the document is requested and 
> squirrel away the munged file transparently.

You're presupposing disk space here, but IMHO the best answer is
to just let the browsers deal with the problems of not understanding
some HTML tags.  

If people are going to look at technical documentation, they will
tend to have technically enabled browsers with Maths and Forms.
If their browser doesn't support it, their clamouring voices
will be another encouragement for browser implementors to get
it right.

Mosaic barely understands LINK, let alone REL attributes.

It can't embed text on the client side.  You aren't doing anything
wrong, it's just that most browsers don't repect REL attributes.

While this still very much needs the expertise of graphic artists, it is
absolutely basic to realize that this medium is different than those that
have come before.

A simple example is that many home pages do not work well on a small
screen.  Open the home page and you get 1/2 of the first graphic, or
somesuch other unpleasantness.

The basic idea is to invest in information once = tagging the information
in SGML and then reuse it many times.

When you reuse the information you use different styles. Mosaic has 
one set of stylesheets. Today I spoke with a customer about their 
documentation problem. They produced market materials, service manuals.....

What he needed was the ability to reuse document components and put them
together to new virtual documents, because the market material used the
same information as the service manual just the style had changed.

Working in the real world you have to have control of your information.
Using the cut and paste way where you loose traceability is not the way into
the future. Instead I think the future is that you like we today can control
our software source code using SCCS or RCS tools for version control.
Should have the same possibility to do a impact analysis of changes of 
information and have traceability.


As an earlier writer said:

Production environment ==> you tag the information intelligent 

Distribution  ==> you map the tagged information for the purpose the 
		  information should be used

Today we see production of HTML which is a format that has to evolve
and Mosaic as a viewer producing one kind of style of info.

We also have to change the definition for documents and start speaking about 
information units that can be reused.

The main problem I see with this solution is that it is HTTP specific.
HTML is an SGML application.  I believe it is best that a solution is
targeted more in the SGML realm so authors have more control on how a
document will appear based upon a client's conformance level.  Plus not
all HTML documents are served via HTTP.

Here's where I think it would be better if authors could state in the
document itself what alternatives should be used based on a clients
capabilities.  For example, an author might want a list to be used in
place of a table for clients w/o table support, instead of the table
being converted to a <PRE> construct.

I may be confused.  SGML, at least I think, doesn't restrict the
interpretation of the items that I know of, which is why HyTime can build
on it.

[.. desc deleted ..]
I think a single "level" is insufficient, since some may be able to
handle the "capability" of a graphic display but not "tables" but vice
versa.  It seems to me you're after a list of items and the support is
an indication of which of these items is or is not in the client.
Perhaps it would be helpful if one can define the set of capabilities
and the basic requirements, as well as the "alternative" -- example,
"label in place of graphics as follows" so that either the server or the
client has a means of handling the "out condition"

I agree this is ugly... but it may be because of the phrasing then the

[.. desc deleted ..]
This is much closer to what I would like to see happen.
But perhaps the *server* could negotiate and decide on some aspect of
*what* to send before that, that would definitely speed things up.
I would suggest some form of client-server negotiation prior to delivery
so that the client and server are doing some of the job and allowing the
best use of net and system.

I'd say: Keep away from CONCUR. I got this advice from quite a few

Before we get too many :

	text/x-<browser-name>-html

documents floating around, it would be good to have a simple 
registry in place that would not require a full standards
body to debate the details of each new set of enhancements
that come along. There is a fair amount of agreement 
today for what is in HTML 1.0 and 2.0 . There is some
general idea of what will be available in HTML 3.0 and
to a lesser extent what could appear in HTML 2.1.  

Perhaps the Netscape extensions could be labeled as "bag a"
of HTML extensions. aka HTML 2.0.a or 2.0 + a . Are there other 
extension naming conventions that could fill the gap ? A mechanism
that allows both a formal standardization process and a rapid 
prototyping environment for new browser developers is important
to maintain the growth of web capabilities.

Agreed, which is the role W3O is going to play.  For those just tuning

Getting together a body like this is a lot of work - hopefully those in

There are two kinds of specs: Experimental, and Standard. Standards
are set either by standards bodies or by organizations that somehow
control the intellectual momentum of the name.

I don't think we should try to control or limit the number of
experiments. Experiments are good, give us experience about what users
want or don't want, etc. Names like x-<browser-name>-html are useful
for experiments.

Standards are that: they're change-controlled, agreed to by multiple
parties, or else controlled by a single organization. I think there
should be a limit to the number of standards around.

If an organization wants to register a media-type and widely promote
its use as a standard, we should encourage that. Adobe can own and
change-control pdf, Mosaic Communication can own and change-control
mcoml, and the IETF html working group will manage the development of
"html".

It's really OK for the experiments to last for a year; using
text/x-mcom-html or text/x-ncsa-html doesn't actually slow anybody
down, and will give us good real-world experience with these document
types.


When you do experiments with formats and protocols, there are two
outcomes: the experiment is a success (and you migrate all the old
documents that were labelled text/x-mcom-html to be also labelled as
text/html; version=2.0), or the experiment is a failure (and you leave
all the old documents labelled as they were until you can go through
them and fix all the <CENTER> tags.)

Don't imagine that just because we have a proliferation of experiments
that we also have a proliferation of standards. As more and more
people fool with the web and get into the web tools business, we'll
see more and more experiments. Let's not make all the experimenters
wait before they can deploy their experiments, even to the extent of
launching products! Of course, real world products get launched
before standards are approved. The worst thing that can happen,
though, is when the product developers somehow set their products up
so that you can't tell the pre-release-standard version from the one
that actually showed up in the standard. (This happened, for example,
in the interface to Class 2 fax modems, and made an enormous mess for
anyone writing an application, because the pre-release versions used
the official standard name.)

We already *do* have a mechanism that allows both a formal
standardization process and a rapid prototyping environment for new
browser developers. People just have to use it. It doesn't hurt, isn't
very cumbersome.

Yes, graphics desing is *very* important. Raw information is almost
useless (except for analysis by programs). I remember the days when I
used to look at hex dumps, before I got a disassembler...

Correct. Layout can be accomplished with stylesheets.

Minor note with regard to a comment someone made about Mozilla
extensions.  I agree that Table is more of a problem for browsers
that don't support it, however the img alignment constructs in 
Mozilla enable you to produce some really neat pages which will 
look like junk (large vertical graphics with no text next to them)
in a standard HTML browser.  So it's not a completely transparent
issue.

The concern about not serving via HTTP is valid, but I think it's
smaller than the other concerns.  Requireing the document designers
(note that I tend to use the word designer, not author) to keep
track of which features are or are not supported by different
browsers, and keep track of what the relative prevalence of such
browsers is, so they know how important it may be for any given
feature, is a bit onerous.  It is also the case that writing
conditional documents can result in complex and not extremely
readable source documents.  If you have the proper tools, then
this problem could be dealt with automatically by the document
editor (program).  On the other hand, if it can be dealt with
automatically, then we might as well put those tools over on
the server side where it can be done at a level appropriate for
the particular site.

Note that I'm talking with two faces here.  Earlier today I was
arguing for giving designers more control over the format.  Now
I'm arguing that less control is preferable.  I guess I'm not
saying that they *shouldn't* be able to provide conditional
code, in fact there are times when I would definitely like the
functionality.  However I don't believe that it should be
required.

P.S. One of my previous messages apparently crashed many Mime
user agents around the world.  I have a strong suspicion that
this list server is improperly removing the last line of my
headers (namely the boundary line).

<Sigh>
This whole mess can be cleaned up in a very nice way: don't support
HTML explicity! 

If all browsers supported SGML, or a reasonable subset thereof, and
they supported named stylesheets, then this entire issue becomes a
non-issue because all browsers could support all versions of HTML, and
for that matter, even tailor made DTD's for a specific application.

Now everyone will scream "What??! Put and *SGML* parser into our
clients, don't be ridiculous!!" and I will point out that libwww
already goes about 1/3 of the way of supporting enough SGML to make
this possible. It is not *that* hard if one does not use things like
CONCUR, SUBDOC, etc.

What we really, really need is:

1) A "text/sgml" type that allows one to send the information, the
   stylesheet, and the DTD.
2) A stylesheet definition language (DSSSL? I don't know anything
   about it).
3) A parser in every client.

and we will not have any more wars, and a great deal of freedom.
This *is* the way things will go, I can guarantee that, because
many places with large document databases are already turning to SGML,
and the trend is accellerating. As the trend accellerates, more demand
for SGML support *will* appear, and down converting, while in many
ways useful, will not suffice. We should start working on this *now* 

Now, we don't have these facilities here now, so I'll tell you how I
solved this problem in DynaWeb(tm). DynaWeb(tm) does on the fly
conversion from SGML to HTML (or to be precise, from "books" created
by DynaText(tm)). The conversion process is controlled by stylesheets,
and one can name stylesheets in a manner similar to forms:

http://foobar/collection/book?fulltext=name&toc=name

using these stylesheets, one can hide parts of the document, change
formatting, include of hide graphics, create a TOC of figures, etc.
The biggest limitation is that HTML is not designed to be a formatting
langauge.... and I will vehemently argue that it should not be.

In effect, in the above, I am faking what should be in the clients.

I will say no more about SGML support in clients, except to say "wait
a year or two" .

After further thought, marked section will not work.  Basically,
what is need is an "if-else" construct, or conditional text.
Mark sections do not have the ability to say "if this condition
is meant, do this; else do this instead".  All they do is include
or exclude data.

I'm reluctant to on solutions that require extra work on the servers
part.  Reason is that servers already have much work to do handle
multiple http connections at a given instance (plus handle CGI).
Adding more task for servers to do will just bog things down.

The content type is not that simple is the stylesheet is not in
SGML.  You'll probably need to use a multipart/mixed.

Alot of data to transmit when I connect to other-side of the world.  I
think supporting SGML directly will be nice, but extra data is required
during transmission (the declaration, the DTD, the stylesheet, and the
document instance).  For big DTDs (and subsequently big stylesheets)
this can be a pain.  I'd hate having to wait for the HTML DTD to
be sent to me evertime I retrieved an HTML document.

(One solution for speeding up transmission would be to adopt real-time
 compression/decompression algorithms into the HTTP protocal.  However,
 I do not know the server-side impact of such an implementation.)

Well, as you note, sending a DTD and stylesheet every time one gets
anything is hardly practical. What I imagined is sending the data as
text/sgml or somesuch, and then having DTD and stylesheets sent only
if they are not in cache or on disk. Actually, the DTD can be found in
the DOCTYPE declaration, so only a way to map that is needed, we don't
need to declare what is in use.

As I said, I don't know about DSSSL, but I imagine that one
could accomplish such tailoring via different stylesheets. To be
perfectly honest, I think there will probably need to be more than one
formatting language to meet all needs. For example, a visually
oriented formatting language is useless for the blind unless you can
also map everything onto an aural or tactile clue. I don't think this
is possible. This of course opens the can of worms "How does one
specify stylesheets? How does one *select* stylesheets?"

>Who'll need anything from EBT, if free WWW clients adopt SGML :-)

EBT is not in the browser market. It is in the publishing tools
market. 

I might not have a job next week though... ;-)

:) After further thought, marked section will not work.  Basically,

I believe something like this would be interesting.  However, is the
responsibility that of the server or the client to provide the "alternative"
in your "if-else" statement, ie. 
	if can-handle(Graphics, GIF) "bullet.gif" else "."
If it's the client, how many people will actually just leave it as
        if can-handle(Graphics, GIF) "bullet.gif"

:) Adding more task for servers to do will just bog things down.

Actually, if you think about it, the server does *less* in the "normal" (:))
case if you allow "pre-negotiation of capabilities" -- a lot of delivery
will not be necessary at all.  If you're doing the "if-else" case above,
the responsibility on the client which doesn't handle the "gif" doesn't
even need to ask the server, so no negotiation is necessary.  However,
if the capability is required for the document, and the client doesn't
handle it, why deliver it at all? or at least the part necessary (in 
document stuff, not "hyper-linked" in stuff :)).

Well, I like to think HTML and SGML were written for people like me too,
since I'm not concerned excusively with the aesthetics of a design. I
appreciate and value the portability that logical styles provide. And I
don't want to see HTML's utility and long-term usefulness for people like
you (and me) diluted by pressures to give it more "page-layout-like"
capabilities.

>TeX and low-level formatting languages like PostScript are for people
>like you.

Umm, are there browsers that will interpret those languages "live" the way
Mosaic, NetScape interpret HTML? If not, I think one of the points I was
trying to make in my original post stands: users, and designers, will try
to make HTML do things (ie, page layout) that it wasn't intended to do.

WWW, and Mosaic, didn't experience explosive growth over the last year
because all users like logical markup. WWW provides attractive, simple,
_fun_ access to the wealth of information on the Internet. Many people
prefer to access information this way. I don't think it's unreasonable that
many did _not_ recognize that _logical markup_ was at work.

As more and more businesses and individuals join the net community, I think
the pressures on HTML will only increase.

I totally agree. I just wonder what can be done to ensure it.

OK, but make it simple for people to use 3.0 features or they will not be used.

I would hate 3.0 to be shunted into some sort of backwater where it's main 
purpose was to be discussed by sad-o academics while everyone else forks off on 
a new development path.

Ah yes, documents served by FTP or through email, perhaps even NNTP when groups 
with HTML postings appear...

Does this mean that all document conversion must happen on the client side, 
then? Because if so, it means that all existing browsers become broken when HTML 
3.0 documents start appearing on the net.

What does an existing browser do with a 3.0 imagemap where all the URL list and 
stuff is in the document for client-side processing?

Fine, but how do you express this so that existing clients can do the right 
thing now, or be trivially modified to do so?

And, its a lot of effort for document authors to go to for a transitional period 
where there are 2.0 and 3.0 browsers around.

I suspect that should read,

  "Layout could in the future be accomplished with stylesheets"

which is the problem. HTML stylesheets are not a deployed solution, they are not 
even an experiment. They are a discussion item.

If I am wrong, please give me the URL of a stylesheet using document and the URL 
of its style sheet, plus the FTP address of a browser that uses both of these 
(any platform) and, if needed, the ftp address of a special server or any other 
software that is needed to demonstrate this.

Yes. Realistically, this is going to have to wait for URIs, URNs or whatever 
they are called nowadays - Web server independent URLs that are resolved by a 
URx server like internet addresses are resolved now by name servers.

That way, the DTD, stylesheet and declaration are referenced by URNs so everyone 
uses the same links, and there is a good chance that you already have them. Plus 
a standard declaration for HTML docs for which the browser has the DTD or some 
more convenient equivalent) built in, so it is always there. 

Same for stylesheets, a default one where no link is supplied (ie, a definition 
if how your browser renders things by default).

The system will then fall back gracefully so that a plain HTML document does not 
involve carting a DTD etc across the world every time or even the first time. 

Of course, the timescales for this are anyones guess and if they are too far in 
the future, this will never happen because the problem will have been solved 
another way.

Where's the "proprietary", Dave?  If I want to use these extensions in my 
HTML, I can. If I want to incorporate them into the browser I'm writing, I 
can. The 'specification' is published. Mosaic Communications hasn't slapped 
a copyright on them. There's no royalty payment.

The fact that they were decided without 'public discussion' does not make 
them proprietary.

When NCSA first 'unleashed' Mosaic on the world of the web, were they 
castigated for the HTML changes they made? Were those extensions called 
'proprietary'? (as I remember, it was 'yes' and 'no').

No one owns the web. No one owns HTML. Anyone can announce that the browser 
they've developed will support the elements <X> </X>, or in-line mpeg, or 
anything else they want. If its successful, and users like it, it will be 
incorporated into other browsers, and become part of 'the web'. If not, it 
won't.

That's how de facto standards are created. And, funny thing, de facto 
standards tend to be much more widely honored than de jure standards - 
precidely because they're the ones people want to use!

It still seems unnecessarily complicated to me for a browser-server pair to 
exchange more than one pair of messages for a file upload POST.  However, it 
would require a precognitive browser to know whether it can send the POST 
without overflowing the server if there is not an initial message exchange 
on data allocation limits.

One technique to overcome this problem is to split off the free file space 
response into a separate HTTP method.  An additional method, METRICS, could 
return the server free file space datum as well as any others that would be 
helpful to a browser.  Alternatively, METRICS could take an argument:
     METRICS metricname
where "metricname" is the name of a metric, with "ALL" reserved for all 
supported server metrics values.  Even though the problem of how much free 
space is available on a server cannot be solved in most server environments 
(all multi-tasking environments that support  file size increases in the 
background), an HTTP server can just make an educated guess as to how much 
space a browser can safely consume.  From my experience, it is likely that 
this guess will be good enough to reduce network traffic substantially; it 
is less likely (IMHE (in my humble experience)) that a browser user will 
want to upload files that come very close to filling up their allocated 
space than the case of those files taking up either significantly less or 
more than the browser user's free space.  If the volatility of free space on 
a server is not close to that of the majority of file uploads, an educated 
guess should work pretty well (cf. Craig Milo Rogers in 
<11428.782066705@drax.isi.edu>).  If it is, then you will get into a 
thrashing state, where file uploads will appear to fail randomly as the 
educated guess is just not good enough.

METRICS could either be run "in the background" as scheduled by the browser 
or when HTML specifying a file upload widget was seen by the browser, the 
browser could force a METRICS method to run before permitting the browser 
user to perform their POST.

If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.

HTML rendered in your browszer of choice not only looks like a duck, it is 
yellow, has webbed feet and talks to other ducks ;-)

Trouble is, on someone elses machine it looks and honks like a goose.

People will always bring the paradigms they are familiar with to new situations 
and try and make them fit. They will then make adjustments so they fit better.

I have seen discussions among Computer Aided Learning folks on how the M-entity 
could be made non-resizable and always have the same colours and fonts etc to 
stop people messing up the layout. That is their approach for other CAL tools so 
they want to do that here. Constrain the user.

By providing exactly the same browser functionality and background colour and 
even default window size on all platforms, Mozilla gives these users a lot of 
what they are asking for. To my knowledge it is the only browser to do so.

Look in the app-defualts file for Mozilla; it tells you not to change the fonts 
because then pages will not look right. It won't let you alter the background 
colour from grey because, as it says in the FAQ, many pages assume a grey 
background (!!)

I see a lot of pages on the net where the formatting all messes up if you have 
M-entity for X use anything other than the default width.

And I have even seen a page recently which had a link "if your page looks wrong" 
that explained how to change M-entity for WinDoze to particular screen sizes and 
fonts to make everything look as it was designed to.

You can't blame people from thinking HTML is a page description language, 
because it does describe pages and they are laid out on screen.

There have been a lot of suggestions in the last year for alternatives to HTML 
for those who want better page layout control. For the most part, these have 
been made by people who did not want such facilities, rather than those who did. 
IE, go away and use this other thing which may perhaps be suitable. It was 
encouraging to see Mark Connolly's statements in this regard, and also that 
graphics designer who posted here a few months back about the design work he had 
been contracted to do for some companies' web pages.

People do not want to go away and use a proprietary and incompletely documented 
format like Microsoft RTF which does not give them HTTP links and for which 
browsers do not exist. They see HTML as very nearly giving them what they want, 
and if a browser supplier gives them some more on top of that, they will flock 
to use it.

Corporates who wish to put forward a corporate image will deal with 
inter-browser variations by bundling one particular browser with their products, 
not by struggling to write browser-independent HTML or voluntarily refraining 
from naughty-but-nice parctices that their competitors are using to make *their* 
web pages look better.

All this is true, but as you say it is a *new* paradigm, and people are for the 
most part still using the old one. You can't educate everyone all at once.

Browser support for marked sections is clearly
desirable, for this and other reasons.  I'm
not holding my breath though; two of the three 
browsers I use don't even get comment declarations 
right yet.

True, but I don't think that's too big an issue.
Forms, imagemaps, and indexes don't work over
anything but HTTP either.

This is desireable, but authors mustn't be required
to write and maintain both versions of the table.

How about something like this:

<!-- in the prolog, declare which features the document uses: -->
<?HTML FEATURE tables>
<?HTML FEATURE forms>
<?HTML FEATURE imagemaps>

<HTML>

  ...

<h3>Table 1</h3>

<?DOWNGRADE table pre>
<table>
<!-- a complex table with spanning columns, header and footer rows;
     to be converted to <PRE> for browsers that don't grok tables.
     The <?DOWNGRADE> PI is an instruction to the server-side
     conversion filter.
-->
</table>

<h3>Table 2</h3>

<?DOWNGRADE table dl>
<table>
<!-- table 2 is a simpler, two-column table;
     to be downgraded to <DL>
-->
</table>

...
</HTML>

I quickly see the discussion on feature support and "quality" control
degrading into two camps.
	
	Camp A)	All the work should be done by the server.
		Specify in HTTP and generate/load the best matching
		document.

	Camp B) All the work should be done in the client.
		Specify in HTML and display the right document.

I'm in favor of 'A' since it is easier to write a "simple" document
and one that does everything you want (ie. tables can be a <PRE> or
a <TABLE>, but it is easy to write)

Instead of shipping over a document that has 31 differnt variations
of the information inside of it based on what capabilites a client
can support.  It is trivial to write a "meta" langauge that a server
can assemble a document from given a set of needs.

Plus the MIME information pretty much requires that a server
pick the right document anyway (ie. language or Accept:).  It's just
that very few servers have done anything about picking good documents.

For stylesheets, we don't really have a choice - all the content is in 
the HTML itself, so conceivably one could even chuck the style sheet and 
still get all the content in a reasonable format.  Obviously 
mapping <H1> to Helvetica 12 point isn't going to mean anything to a 
blind person or someone on Lynx, but in this case I don't think that's 
bad, as long as the HTML content is properly semantically marked up.

I don't think that's necessary - DTD's should be cached, even 
persistantly disk-cached, and hopefully there'd be a common HTML 2.0 
DTD, HTML 3.0 DTD, etc.  Sites that had a different DTD for every 
document had better have a good reason.  Style sheets could be similarly 
persistant.

Well, yes, actually it does.  The word 'proprietary' and the distinction
between proprietary and open really have to do with ownership.  As in,
control.

People often confused 'public availability of a spec' with 'open
technology'.  The reality is that publishing a proprietary spec serves to
permit a third-party aftermarket, but still leaves the technology under
non-public control.

Just for grins, I'm attaching the relevant portion of my ACM paper on the
IETF standards process; it talks about just this distinction.

Dave, that's not the way the public interoperability game is played.  The
reason for a standards process is to obtain community consensus about
features and details.  As I've said, there are all sorts of reasons to work
separately from such a process, but we all need to realize that the
efficiencies and speediness and other benefits of such private efforts
nonetheless carry some costs, in particular, costs in terms of less
inteorperability and increased market leverage (for the producer of the
technology).

>That's how de facto standards are created. And, funny thing, de facto

You are, of course, correct.  And it's a very good way to make progress
quickly.  But as I've said, the question then is whether the community is
given control or whether proprietary interests prevail.

WHAT DOES "OPEN" MEAN?

  The  commercial  pressure  for open systems  has  been  specifically
intended  to let customers obtain products from a variety of  vendors,
potentially buying each component with a competitive bid.   But  there
are  different  ways to create multiple sources of a product,  so  the
remainder  of this section considers the options and particularly  the
types  of  organizations  that produce these  various  kinds  of  open
systems.

Open publication

  A  vendor  may  publish  the  specifications  of  their  proprietary
technology.  This allows a third-party "aftermarket" to exist, usually
selling  products  at  a  lower price than the  vendor  who  owns  the
specification.  At any time, however, the vendor may choose to  change
the specification and delay publication of the changes until after the
vendor has released its own new products.

  Another   concern   is  that  specifications  are  not   universally
available.   For example, requiring consortium membership,  with  high
membership fees, effectively restricts the free flow of information to
the community at large.  Certainly consortia have special advantage by
controlling the content of a specification, while preventing community-
wide review of its choices.

Open ownership

  Traditional,  "accredited" standards bodies have relatively  liberal
rules  of  membership and conduct open meetings.  They  publish  their
specifications,  though usually for a significant price,  making  them
available to any customer or vendor.  No single company and no market-
driven consortium control the specifications, allowing vendors to work
from  a reasonably level playing field.  Work is done only at meetings
which  are  held  at  venues around the world.   This  requires  major
investment  by  anyone  wishing to attend,  constituting  an  implicit
barrier to regular, broad-based participation.

Open development

  The  most  extreme approach develops specifications in a forum  open
to  anyone who is interested in participating, allowing on-line contri
bution  so  that travel is not required.  The results  then  are  also
available to all, at little or no charge and in a highly convenient on-
line  format  to  anyone  interested in reading  them.   This  is  the
approach used by the Internet.

  Selection  of  technical topics also can be by open process.   If  a
topic  lacks an adequate constituency, it's not pursued.  If  a  topic
has  diverse constituencies they are free to go their own ways and the
market chooses among them.  Continuing on-line discussions, away  from
the meetings, allows progress to be made quickly.

I'd like a little clarification as to what "free" really is
here. The license says:

| 1.  Mosaic Communications Corporation ("MCom") grants to you a
|non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, license to use version 0.9 beta of the
|Mosaic Netscape network navigator (the "Software"), in binary executable
|form for evaluation and trial use purposes only.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-and-

|4. While MCom intends to distribute a commercial release of the Software,
|MCom reserves the right at any time not to release a commercial release of
|the Software or, if released, to alter prices, features, specifications,
|capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general
|availability or other characteristics of the commercial release.

I have also called Mosaic Communications and received a $99 quote
for a copy.

Does free mean:

a) free to anyone who can download it from an approved mirror site.
b) free to anyone who can download it from a site where it was posted
	so that people could get better access?
c) free for home/education use but it will cost for a company to
	use it internally.
d) free to everyone for an acceptible evaluation period, but then
	it should be registered and paid for by everone or just
	some people?

And what about distribution. I know that netscape has been
posted to quite a few other places than the originally named
mirror sites. The only distribution comment in the License had
to do with duplication by the Government. What are the duplication
restrictions? Only on the Internet proper? On the Internet and
any BBS that can get a copy?

I know that there must be a methodology in the product handling,
but it really isn't visible to this ignorant soul. Enlightenment
would be appreciated.

My understanding and I am NOT speaking from an official positions is
that it is free for "personal use".  That would make A & B true, 
C true if it is a corporate policy decision, and d always false.

A company which decides to use Netscape as the basis for a CWIS needs
to get a licsense.  However, _individuals_ within the organization can
use it for free.  With this in mind, my understanding of the distribution
restrictions is to prevent one corporate Sysop from downloading a copy
and installing it on 10,000 corporate PCs.  This is no longer personal
use.  If each of those PC users downloaded their own copy that would
be cool.

Again, I'm sure that our lawyers will claim that I am oversimplifing
the agreement but we are basically just trying to be fair.  If people
are just using Netscape to cruise the Web for fun we don't want anything.
If a company uses Netscape as part of the corporate infrastructure
than it is reasonable to expect them to pay for it.  It is also basically
inevitable because by paying for it they will receive the support that
they are going to want if they are basing their CWIS on the product...

AGAIN:  This is simply my understanding of how the legalese translates
        into English.  It isn't an official policy statement...

Jon

Is there anyone at Mosaic Communications that can speak 
publically on this. I am asking this because "personal use"
isn't mentioned anywhere that I can see in the license.

The only "personal" reference is that the license can't be 
transfered from one person to another. What you are saying is 
reasonable, what marca is saying is reasonable, but it doesn't 
match the license (which appears to be legally binding).

I am also curious about the distribution issues. If a sysadmin,
downloaded the netscape and placed it on an internal ftp
site for a company and then each person downloaded/installed
the software on their own system, is that appropriate?

As for option d being false all of the time, since the license
does state that the binary is available for evaluation and
trial purposes, d is true, at least some of the time.

Thanks for the input. I appreciate your help and the product
itself.

The tcpdump program will not work on the slip device any more than it will 
work on the PPP device. I reported a similar problem to this group earlier 
when someone complained about the same trap with PPP.

The problem is that the dev_ifsioc procedure does a blind call to put the 
device into promiscous mode. The PPP and SLIP devices do not have an entry 
for this procedure and it is zero.

The logic in the ioctl processing needs to test to see if the device may be 
allowed to go into this mode before it accepts the request and sets the 
device flag for promiscous. If there is no procedure, the ioctl operation 
should not be allowed.

An alternative would be to put the entries for PPP and SLIP into the table. 
However, there is no way that the driver can report back that "it can't do 
this" to the ioctl processing so that it may return the error to tracedmp so 
that tracedmp may report the error to the user and the user will know that 
you can't run tracedmp with SLIP or PPP.

The best that this procedure could do is to turn off the flag bit in the 
device flags. PLIP and possibly the AX-25 logic would possibly have the same 
problem.

I would like to build a sun->linux cross compiler.  I have done this before
using the instructions in the GCC-FAQ, however they seem to be quite out of
date.

Specifically, I would like to be able to build either a.out or ELF executables,
using the latest gcc.  I never did get shared libs working the last time I 
build the cross compiler, and I would like to get it right this time.

Thanks for any help.

Due to g++ version 2.5.8 being unable to compile some code I had I
upgraded to the latest snapshot of gcc. This version is able to
compile the code, but I now get the following warnings.

In file included from telnet.cc:17:
/usr/include/unistd.h:263: warning: declaration of `volatile void _exit(int)'
/usr/include/unistd.h:263: warning: conflicts with built-in declaration `void _exit(int)'

/usr/include/stdlib.h:262: warning: declaration of `volatile void exit(int)'
/usr/include/stdlib.h:262: warning: conflicts with built-in declaration `void exit(int)'

It seems that the prototypes that g++ version 2.6.0-941014 expects
differ from those in the header files supplied with libc.so.4.6.16.

Subject: 3c503 goes weird when promiscuous
Date: Wed, 19 Oct 1994 16:46:28 +0100 (MET)


Hello,

I am tcpdumping a busy net with a Linux box (486/66) and a 3c503 card.  
>From time to time, tcpdump goes to sleep waiting for a packet and doesn't 
wake up anymore (Yes, I am _quite_ sure there are still packets passing 
on the cable).  I can kick it back to life with e.g. an outbound ping 
(btw, I can't reach my machine from outside at that moment), a 'netstat', 
a 'cat /proc/dev/whatever', ...  It looks like I just have to kick the 
kernel somewhere around the network code.  At some of these stops, the 
interface leaves promiscuous mode (although ifconfig doesn't say that), 
and I get a 'Transmit timeout (TXstatus 0x40, ISR 0x0); Network cable 
problem ?' in /var/adm/debug.
I already tried with kernels 1.0.9, 1.1.52, 1.1.54.
Has anybody got a clue what goes on ?
Thanks in advance !

Subject: libc and fseek
Date: Wed, 19 Oct 1994 13:54:58 +0100



Hello, I've been fiddeling with xdvi on linux.  It was slow at
starting up.  The reason it was slow is that whenever a program does
fseek libc 4.5.26 (It's very hard for me to test a later version,
sorry) wants to do lseek and read sys calls.  A small test program:

----------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

{
  FILE *f;
  int t;

  f=fopen("/dev/zero","r");
  for (t=0;t<=1024;t++) fseek(f,t,SEEK_SET);
  close(f);
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

_Every_ fseek results in one lseek and one read (strace shows):

lseek(4, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
read(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1024) = 1024
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
read(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1024) = 1024
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
read(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1024) = 1024
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
read(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1024) = 1024
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
read(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1024) = 1024

(Yes, it lseeks to position 0 every time, then reads the same 1024
bytes every time.)

This is very slow, and imho stupid.  And it is especialy slow when the
file in question is read over nfs.  I counted xdvi generating 96
lseek/read pairs while reading the 1024 first bytes of a pk font file.
Replacing the fseek with a fread for the number of bytes xdvi wanted
to skip cut the execution time of the procedure in question in half.
So the penalty for lseek/read is high.  It would seem to me that
making linux fseek smarter would be a definitive win.  If for example
fseek just advanced the stdio internal file pointer to the right place
in the file's buffers?

For comparison SGI/Irix 5.2 had no win when converting the fseek to a
fread.  However, Irix libc _did_ generate similar lseek, read system
calls when fseek was used.

On the SGI the startup time for xdvi with my benchmark document is
less than 2 seconds, with local disks or over NFS, with or without the
fseek->fread patch.  Using the patched xdvi on linux with local
disks the startup time is 3 seconds, almost 15 seconds over NFS.
(I realize that the 1.0.9 nfs client is less than impressive speed
wise)  W/o the patch the times are 3 seconds (same) and almost 25.

One might claim that the fault is in the NFS client then, not libc,
but I can't for the life of me see why the system should be bothered
with all those system calls.

I have tried to look at the libc source to se what must be done, but I
quickly got lost :-(

You should do the following on your host machine:

1. Decide where you want to put your cross compiler. Say under
   /foo/bar, do

	mkdir -p /foo/bar

2. Build cross assembler and binutils. You should get the latest
   gas and binutils sources from ftp.cygnus.com under private/jelly.
   You should get binutils 2.5.1 or later snapshot. Then just do
   
	./configure --target=i486-linux --host=cpu-vendor-os --prefix=/foo/bar
	make
	make install
	cp /foo/bar/bin
	cp gcc gcc-ss

3. Get the current inc-x.y.z.tar.gz, image-x.y.z.tar.gz and
   extra-x.y.z.tar.gz. Please do

	cd /foo/bar
	gzip -dc inc-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xof -
	gzip -dc image-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xof - ./usr/lib
	gzip -dc extra-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xof -
	cd usr
	mv lib include ../i486-linux
	cd ..
	rm -rf usr

4. Get the current gcc sourcec code. Do

	a. Build the gcc for your host machine. You can skip it if you
	   want to use the existing one installed on your system.

	b. Build the cross compiler,

	./configure --host=cpu-vendor-os --target=i486-linux --prefix=/foo/bar --local-prefix=/foo/bar
	cat Makefile ../makefile.cross > makefile.cross
	/foo/bar/i486-linux/bin/ar ucvr libgcc1.cross
	make hlu -f makefile.cross

	c. I never tried to do a
	
	make install -f makefile.cross

	You can install it by hand. That leaves as an exercise to
	you. If you can not figure it yourself after reading the gcc
	documentations, I think you should ask/pay someone to do it
	for you.

I'm trying to understand the elf build environment.  It seems the
linker looks for libs in /usr/i486-linuxelf/lib, while the dynamic
loader looks in /lib/elf.

Why two different paths?

	Question: is there anything left in Linux that requires non-ELF
binaries.  In particular, do we still need non-ELF binaries to build:

		(a) the kernel, and
		(b) dynamicly loadable libraries for the Andrew system.

	I know that andrew can be built under SCO Unix, so I would
assume that there already is an ELF or COFF version of the andrew
dynamically loadable libraries somewhere in the andrew source tree.
I'm just wondering if people have actually done either of these
things yet.

Building shared Andrew libraries is as easy as adding '-fpic' to
CFLAGS and '--shared' to the link command.  However, there is no
distribution of ELF X libraries yet, so Andrew wouldn't be very
useful.

I think, /usr/include/sys/cdefs.h is the problem:
[...]
#if __GNUC__ < 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 5) || 
defined(__cplusplus)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  /* Old GCC way. */
#ifndef __CONSTVALUE
#define __CONSTVALUE    __const__
#define __CONSTVALUE2
#endif
#ifndef __NORETURN
#define __NORETURN      __volatile__
#define __NORETURN2
#endif
#else
  /* New GCC way. */
[...]

Maybe the underlined __cplusplus causes the problems.

Bernhard.

I have been having this "problem" for (at least) as long as I've been using
slackware 1.2 based Linux systems, and I guess I've finally got to the
point where I can't look for the error any more, and it is really
getting to me..

These are the most common, I get hundreds of these each day:
Aug  9 18:58:30 gary named[20268]: recvfrom: Connection refused
Aug  9 18:58:57 gary named[20268]: recvfrom: Connection refused
Aug  9 18:59:02 gary named[20268]: recvfrom: Connection refused


But I also get messages like this from most udp based services:
Oct  4 18:48:43 gary talkd[13803]: recv: Connection refused
Oct 11 15:17:55 mach25 syslogd: recvfrom inet: Connection refused 
etc...

(mach25 is a machine that logs to gary).

What causes this? it doesn't seem to cause anything not to work, but,
1) it fills up my logs so that I can't see real problems.
2) it might mean that things are having to retry.

this happens on all kernels from .99.x to 1.1.52 or so, and happens on
my ethernet connected machines at school, and my ppp-connected machine
here at home.

Anyone know how to resolve this?

I couldn't recompile bash at all (I sent you the bug report), so I
compiled zsh-2.3.1 in both a.out and ELF formats. Each shell then runs
the script which runs the simple g++ program (this way, I can be sure
that the appropriate library is in core).

I used the same compile options on all the various builds.

Here's what happens:

I have uploaded the patches and shared libraries to our local FTP
server. You can get them from

	ftp://ifwsn4.ifw.uni-hannover.de/private/linuxelf/

Maybe someone in the US can mirror this, it's less than 1MB...

Yes. Kernel has to be compiled in a.out. I think it is the time to

Are you saying "loadable"? Eric is working on dlopen et al. If they
are not written in C++ or not using dlclose (), they will be supported
when we have dl stuff. We are still looking for a good solution for
the shared C++ libraries to work with dlopen/dlclose.

I have the exact same problem.  To solve it, I basically had to
constantly ping my DNS server.  I'm using Linux 1.1.18 w/3c503.  
If I don't constantly ping, the Web server is unavailable after 
a day or so.  Crude, but effective.  I didn't have the time to 
find the reason, just enough to solve the problem.  Please let me 
know if someone replies to you with an answer and or patch.  Thanks.

  3c503 goes weird when promiscuous

Subject: 3c503 goes weird when promiscuous
Date: Wed, 19 Oct 1994 16:46:28 +0100 (MET)


Hello,

I am tcpdumping a busy net with a Linux box (486/66) and a 3c503 card.  
>From time to time, tcpdump goes to sleep waiting for a packet and doesn't 
wake up anymore (Yes, I am _quite_ sure there are still packets passing 
on the cable).  I can kick it back to life with e.g. an outbound ping 
(btw, I can't reach my machine from outside at that moment), a 'netstat', 
a 'cat /proc/dev/whatever', ...  It looks like I just have to kick the 
kernel somewhere around the network code.  At some of these stops, the 
interface leaves promiscuous mode (although ifconfig doesn't say that), 
and I get a 'Transmit timeout (TXstatus 0x40, ISR 0x0); Network cable 
problem ?' in /var/adm/debug.
I already tried with kernels 1.0.9, 1.1.52, 1.1.54.
Has anybody got a clue what goes on ?
Thanks in advance !
Bruno

I have talked to our VP of Engineering.  He is going to get

Nothing *prevents* them.  However it's a pretty large hurdle to
climb for a product of questionable marketability.  When the market
matures it will happen.  In the meantime HTML has to play all things

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

I'm generating pages in which I want to store meta information of
interest to my HTML editing tools and to some of my server applications.

I currently do something like:

<!-- metainfo --> html code <!- /metainfo -->

That obviously works, but is it necessary?

Is it legit for me to do something like this?

<UImetainfo> html code </UImetainfo>

That simplifies my parsing code, makes other tools available to
me, etc.  But of course it's non-standard.  Also, these aren't
extensions that I would anticipate being of any use to anyone
else.

Don't know, but what about dosemu?  It needs changing at least ...
AFAICR, the current procedure is to write most of it as a library
starting at .5Gb, then have a small loader program that jumps to it

Just a note.  While we can port alot of applications to Elf, we should
remember the commerical places that sell Motif.

They will yell loudly if we change formats suddenly on them.

If/when we do go all elf, they should all be notified.

I have the same errors as before, undefined references that shouldn't be.
I thought perhaps my source tree was corrupt somehow, so I downloaded a fresh

Does anyone know if there's support (actual or planned) for
Pentium support in the latest (2.6.x) versions of GCC?  Something
like:

gcc -m586 ....

??  Would be useful.

Subject: address space segmentation
Date: Thu, 20 Oct 94 19:42:08 +0100


Dear H.J., Eric and all,

ELF programs apparently call mmap(..., MAP_FIXED, ...) at addresses like
0x4008b000 and 0x8000000. This makes mmap() less useful because it cuts
down the range of available addresses.

Up to now, with a.out, we have the following layout:

       0xFFFFFFFF
           ...       kernel space, not available in user mode
       0xC0000000

       0xBFFFFFFF
           ...       stack, growing downward
       0x80000000

       0x7FFFFFFF
           ...       shared libraries, usually at 0x6.......
       0x60000000

       0x5FFFFFFF
           ...       mmap() and shmat() segments with no address specified
       0x40000000

       0x3FFFFFFF
           ...       free for mmap(MAP_FIXED) and shmat()
     ~ 0x01000000
           ...       program, data, bss, brk & malloc
       0x00000000

mmap(.. MAP_FIXED ..) is useful because the programmer can choose the
address, for example to encode type or protection information in the
high 8 bits of the address. (Lisp and Prolog implementations make use
of this.)

With the current scheme, 95 segments of 16 MB each are available
(0x01..0x5F), with the ability to encode information in 7 bits.

If, with ELF, only the address space 0x10000000..0x3FFFFFFF remains
(what's below 0x08000000 ?), this is restricted to 48 segments of 16 MB each,
with only 6 bits for information.

Can this be avoided?

How about

1. moving the 0x40000000 stuff to 0x70000000,

2. setting the initial brk() value to 0x00800000 instead of 0x08000000 ?
   (In fact, USL SVR4/386 uses 0x08000000, Ultrix and Irix use 0x10000000,
   AIX uses 0x20000000, HP-UX uses 0x40000000. Are they playing dice?)

   I understand that the program's address is stored in the ELF header
   field called `vaddr'. Can it be specified as a linker option?

We have 4 GB address space. Look what you make out of it!

Many many processes are not associated with a terminal and are interactive
in their patterns (inetd, telnetd, rlogind - and not just network programs).
Many terminal programs are definitely large batch jobs (g++). I don't believe
a tty is a good hint.

The important one is getting I/O bound processes run so that they can do
another I/O request and go back to sleep ASAP. This improves their 
throughput at little cost.

Another requirement that is important is that the scheduler be as close
to taking no time as possible each schedule. Since policy has to be 
evaluated at sufficient rate to cope with the fast changing needs of the
system it also has to be fast, or if its slow it loses the ability to handle
fast changing situations and the low level schedule() has to cover those
cases.

Use a bus mouse driver. Bus mice read basically X,Y,button state every n
times a second. X,Y,button state is also what comes from the mouse server 8)

It, assorted bugs - including the invalid socket inode bug (that was a good

BSD based programs often log udp recvfrom errors. As BSD incorrectly doesn't
report the ICMP unreachable but Linux does it right you get these logged.
Just clobber the message and recompile named.

This is a blanket request to all WWW browser developers:
Please put URN support into your browsers at least to the
point where if an HREF value begins with URN: then allow
the whole thing to pass through your URL parser unscathed.

Current examples are that Mosaic will parse 
<URN:DNS:gatech.edu:oit.cs.it> as URN:oit.cs.it. Mozilla
puts the current pages scheme,host,port in front as though
it were a partial URL. This makes setting up a URN testbed
very very difficult.

Thanks!

Didn't <META CONTENT="foo"> get defined at some point?
(Did that discussion ever reach closure?)

The accepted (least frowned upon) method of embedding meta info
is to use
   <META CONTENT="name=value">
or similar schemes.

I guess you can use
   <META CONTENT="<start>">content<META CONTENT="</start>">
except for the fact that certain commonly used browsers barf
on angle brackets in quotes.

This leads to all sorts of problems with embedding meta info - basically
you have to URL escape everything to stop the browser parsers from
going ga-ga.

All,

I've placed a full-text searchable index of all of the WWW conference
papers on our public server <URL:http://www.verity.com/>.  It's in the
demonstrations area, in the spider-built index demos.  The direct route to
the search page is <URL:http://www.verity.com/spidersearch.html>.

The various other collections I built for the conference are also there,
including GNN, searchable individually or in combinations.

I think you want to use the <META> tag.  Quoting from the October 13, 1994
draft version of the HTML 2.0 spec:

  The META element is used within the head element to embed document
  meta-information not defined by other HTML elements.  Such information can
  be extracted by servers/clients for use in identifying, indexing, and
  cataloging specialized document meta-information.

  e.g. <META NAME="IndexType" content="Service">

However, as currently defined you can't use these tags in the BODY, which
sounds like it might be important to you.
  
Hope that helps,

Except in emacs-w3, AIR Mosaic, it's planned for Cello,

<P align=center> and wait."

True, but there is so much perceived consensus on
this particular issue it's a safe bet that alignment
attributes are going to make it into the standard
at SOME point.

That may be the *existing* practice; the *standard* practice --
namely, what's recommended by the HTML 2.0 draft standard --
is that <P> is a container.

(Container, container, container!)

PROPOSAL:

    That a CENTER element (described below) be added to
    the next revision of the HTML standard.

DESCRIPTION:

    CENTER is used to center lines of text.

RATIONALE:

    Document authors often want to center large sections
    of a document, not just individual units.  The proposed
    alignment attributes for paragraphs, headings and other
    elements are inadequate and cumbersome for this purpose,
    since they force authors to enter the same attribute
    specification on many different tags.

SEMANTICS:

    The CENTER element has no associated semantics.  Instead,
    it is strictly a presentational hint (much like the B, I, TT
    and U character formatting elements).

SPECIFICATION:

    The CENTER element is a block-level element, similar to
    BLOCKQUOTE.  It may appear inside the BODY element, list items (LI,
    DD), FORMs, and anywhere other block-level elements are allowed.

    Headings, paragraphs, lists, and other block-level elements may
    appear inside CENTER elements.

    Both the start-tag <CENTER> and the end-tag </CENTER>
    must be present.

SUGGESTED RENDERING:

    CENTER implies a line break before and after the element.

    Inside a CENTER element, each line of paragraphs, lists, and
    headings should be displayed centered instead of flush-left.
    That is, the center of each text line should be vertically
    aligned with the center of the display area.

    CENTER should not affect the line-breaking algorithm:  it only
    changes the final placement of text lines.

    Preformatted text blocks (PRE) and other block display elements
    (such as tables, if implemented) within CENTER should be centered
    as a unit, not line-by-line.

    Browsers that use flush-right or flush-both justification as the
    default rendering for any elements should disable this for elements
    inside a CENTER.

    In the case of conflicting alignment specifications, the innermost
    specification overrides the outermost.  For example, if the
    proposed <P ALIGN=RIGHT> appears inside a CENTER, the paragraph
    contents should be displayed flush-right, but everything before and
    after should be centered.

CHANGES TO DTD:

    This element may be added to the DTD with minimal changes:

    1) Add CENTER to the %block; parameter entity declaration:

<!ENTITY % block "P | %list | DL
        | %preformatted
        | BLOCKQUOTE | CENTER %block.forms">


    2) Add the following element declaration:

<!ELEMENT CENTER - - %body.content;>

    No other changes are necessary.

SAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION:

    This element is implemented by the Netscape browser,
    now available at FTP sites everywhere.  (Plug: Netscape's
    got a few other neat features that you might also
    want to try out :-)

IMPACT ON EXISTING IMPLEMENTATIONS:

    None.  Existing browsers can safely ignore the CENTER
    start- and end- tags; the resulting display will
    still be a correct rendering of the document content.

====

There.  What was so fucking hard about that?

====

Now if someone made that proposal, someone else might have come up with
a counter-proposal:

    Based on the rationale for CENTER, it seems that what is *really*
    desired is a mechanism for treating large sections of a document as
    a unit, and not centering _per se_.

    How about adding a general-purpose DIVISION element instead?

    DIVISION would be allowed in the same places as the proposed
    CENTER element, and defined like:

<!ELEMENT DIVISION - - %body.content;>

<!ATTLIST DIVISION
	ID	ID 	#implied  		-- Unique identifier --
	ALIGN	(left|center|right)	#implied
			-- default value for alignment is "no change" --
	-- Others attributes? --
>

    The ID attribute allows DIVISIONs to work as link destinations.

    This element would allow large sections of text to be centered (as
    desired), and would be more generally useful than a special-purpose
    CENTER element.

====

See how responsive MCOM is to the needs of the users?
They wanted a <CENTER> tag and MCOM gave it to them.
If it were up to all the SGML purists on www-talk
nobody would have any control over how their documents
look at all.

====

Final note:  The CENTER proposal is a serious one.
So is the counter-proposal for DIVISION.

You probably want an attribute on CENTER to specify that the entire
block be centered as a whole rather than line by line.

Would they disable it, or would they fall into the "pre" catagory
of doing a block center?

This looks contradictory to me.

If a body writes:

	<h1> here's some stuff</h1>
	<p> normal para
	<center> centered text</center>

then today's browsers will blur the "centered text" with the "normal
para".

So it appears that <center> does have impact on existing browsers.
Deploying new block level elements is somewhat problematic.

Given that, the DIV or DIVISION element seems like a better idea.

Gee... this looks more and more like SDL all the time. I suppose
that's inevitable.

In general, any unknown scheme should be parsed to the proxy server
unscathed! 

Frankly, I've never seen a need for multiple proxy servers. Has anyone
ever used a different proxy for one protocol vs the other?

  I'd say do it this way, because it won't generate errors in 'strict'
browsers that have the option to spit out warnings about unknown tags,
ommitted tags, etc.  (currently Arena does a great job of this, and
emacs-w3 does some of it)

  You can also use the META tag.  Something like:

<META NAME="SOMEINFO" CONTENT="SOMEDATA">

Are there exceptions for fragment identifiers, and search terms, and
relative paths, or not?  For example:

	<p>See <a href="urn:234lkj23/4lk2j#section1">section 1 of "The
		Birds and The Bees</a> for more info.
	</body>

If the user selects the link, what data goes to the proxy?
	GET urn:234lkj23/4lk2j#section1 HTTP/1.0
or
	GET urn:234lkj23/4lk2j HTTP/1.0

RFC1630 would suggest the latter. The current URL specs would suggest
the former, although it's not clear that it necessarily answers this
question. It's possible that a WWW client should remove #... at the
end of an HREF attribute before considering it as an internet URL.

Then suppose the resulting document (let's suppose the answer above is
urn:234lkj23/4lk2j ) contains:

	<html>
	<head><isindex><title>An Example</title></head>
	<body>
	<p> See <a href="../overview.html">the overview</a> for
	more info.

What if the user selects that link? Is this an error? Must the process
of resolving urn:234lkj23/4lk2j yield some "local" address (ala the
HTTP URI: or Location: header or the HTLM <BASE> tag) for use
with relative HREF's?

Then suppose the user enters "frogs and dogs" as search keywords for
the ISINDEX search.  What data goes to the proxy? RFC1630 would
suggest

	GET urn:234lkj23/4lk2j?frogs+and+dogs HTTP/1.0


I suppose <isindex> doesn't have to work with methods besides http and
wais, but there's no reason for it not to. But perhaps a <FORM> is
necessary to search databases using other schemes...

>Frankly, I've never seen a need for multiple proxy servers. Has anyone

It's ironic that you would ask that in response to Michael's question:
clearly his scenario (testing a urn: proxy) motivates a capability to
select different proxies for different services. But it's not clear
that this feature is widely used...

Hm.

OK: if %HTML.Recommended; is turned on, then the
example  "<p>normal para<center>centered text..."
is illegal to begin with.

With this switch enabled, the content models for
CENTER and DIVISION expand to:

(H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6|P|UL|OL|DIR|MENU|DL|PRE|BLOCKQUOTE|FORM|ISINDEX|HR|ADDRESS)*,

all of which also imply line-breaks before and after,
so it looks like this can still work.

Suggested revision:  Strike the statement "CENTER implies 
a line break..." from the SUGGESTED RENDERING section
(since it's redundant), and add a note to the effect
that:

	CENTER may only be used in conjunction with
	the recommended HTML 2.0 features.  In particular,
	this means that CENTER may not directly contain
	text (you must use <P> containers instead).

and replace the first sentence of IMPACT ON EXISTING IMPLEMENTATIONS
with:

	None, as long as %HTML.Recomended; is also enabled
	in the DTD for documents which use this feature.

> Given that, the DIV or DIVISION element seems like a better idea.

I think so too.

I said:

>unscathed! 

and Dan asked:
>Are there exceptions for fragment identifiers, and search terms, and
>relative paths, or not?...

pointing out an example where an unknown scheme is followed by a
#section1 fragment identifier.

I think the answers are:

* fragment identifiers are *not* part of the URL (despite what RFC1630
  says; this is an area that has been fixed in the current working
  draft, soon to be a proposed standard RFC).

* search terms are part of some URL schemes and not others. Those that
  have them may use a different syntax than others. Gopher URLs can
  contain ? without having the ? treated as the introduction to a
  search term, for example. It would be wrong to have URN => URL
  remove any '?search' suffix, translate the sub-part, and then
  reapply the ?search.

* relative paths are not complete URLs, and thus, the consideration
  of what gets passed to the proxy isn't applicable. Rather, a
  relative path gets combined with the base URL to produce a new
  complete anchor specification; this anchor spec then can be
  treated with the general algorithm.

  
Thus, in:

	<p>See <a href="urn:234lkj23/4lk2j#section1">section 1 of "The
		Birds and The Bees</a> for more info.
	</body>

the data 
	GET urn:234lkj23/4lk2j HTTP/1.0

should be sent to the proxy. Supposing the resulting document contains
  
	<html>
	<head><isindex><title>An Example</title></head>
	<body>
	<p> See <a href="../overview.html">the overview</a> for
	more info.

However, the relative path "../overview.html" is relative to the
'base' location of the result, and not necessarily its original URN
specification.

> Must the process of resolving urn:234lkj23/4lk2j yield some "local"
> address (ala the HTTP URI: or Location: header or the HTLM <BASE> tag)

I believe the processing of relative paths can be described
independently of the scheme of the base URL to which it is being
applied. If the user selects a relative path HREF, it will be combined
with whatever the base reference for the document is. If you want to
use 'urn:' without translation to some more "local" address, then
either the URNs must be spelled with nested a/b/c/d syntax so that the
relative links can be computed against them, or else you must avoid
using them in combination with relative paths, and, for example,
replace all of the relative paths in the document with explicit fully
specified URIs.

I think the same reasoning goes for <ISINDEX> queries, i.e., they only
work for those schemes that support ? as the query method with the
particular syntax defined for it, against the base URI. In this case,
it is even more clear that a 'urn' scheme would want supply a 'base'
against which subsequent queries and relative paths should be defined.

Dan also properly pointed out the irony of my complaint about
'multiple proxy servers' in the light of the experimental urn proxy.

The simplest way to handle the cases of search and relative pointers
would be to have the urn proxy do redirects rather than return the
resource.

The URN is a Uniform Resource NAME, not a Uniform Resource LOCATOR.  It
has to be passed to the URN resolution service to obtain a URL which can
then be used to locate and retreive the document.  So the answer is, yes,
the process of resolving <urn:234lkj23/4lk2j> will provide a URL which can
then be used as the document's base for relative HREFs.

Subject: Structured text v. page descriptions (was Netscape, HTML, and Designers)
content-length: 2011

I don't like the way that the discussion of MCOM's HTML "enhancements" is
shaping up into a debate over the extent to which HTML should include page
description-like characteristics.  We seem to be ignoring the possibility
that there will be a a clear division between structured text and page
descriptions -- and the possibility that it would be a good thing to have
both, separate.  One of the bits of confusion seems to be that the
distinction is getting mixed up with *hypertext*, which isn't peculiar to
either paradigm (HTML's name notwithstanding).

Each approach has clear advantages:

Structured text -- can be easily displayed on a variety of display devices
with varying size, resolution, etc.  Potentially very compact.  Major
disadvantage is that visual design is heavily compromised.  Appropriate
when content is more important than appearance; when bandwidth is
expensive; when many display devices must view a common document.

Page description -- presentation is preserved, visual impact and design are
communicated.  Major disadvantage are the overhead of carrying all of the
visual design information; inability to adapt presentation to the output
device.

We're starting to see major customers adopting *both*.  Sun, for example,
is setting SGML and Acrobat as its standard documentation formats.

I could go on about this for a while, but I'd rather suggest that if the
designers of HTML abandon principles of structured text, they'll ruin it by
creating a standard that has the worst of both worlds.

I'll also point out that we're serving Acrobat documents over the Web
*now*, so this isn't a pipe dream.  Check out <URL:http://www.verity.com/>.

I think designers who want a high level of control should stick with
Acrobat, Common Ground and their ilk, rather than putting pressure on the
HTML designers to break its paradigm.  By way of disclosing a conflict of
interest, I don't want to leave out the fact that our engine is built into
Acrobat and is going into Common Ground.

While I agree with the overall content of Nick's message, I don't like
the way this implies you *can't* get good visual display with
structured documents.

In a structured document, the document is a tree of nodes. To display
the document, one walks down the tree, processing each node, and there
is no inherent limitation on the amount of processing performed on
each node, so one if theoretically unlimited in what one can do.
Particularly if one uses the boxes and glue model, you can build very
nice looking documents indeed.

That said, I do agree that while you can get good results from such
systems, at the finest level, it is usually hard to match the output
of a composition engine with runtime formatting like that in HTML (or
even DynaText(tm)), so yes, there is certainly a place for various
different viewing technologies.

I checked it out. It does seem to work well, though Acrobat said a couple
of the pdf documents I accessed through you server were "damaged" and
couldn't be opened. Not sure what the prblem was.

Adobe's belated decision to make multiple platform Acrobat Readers freely
distibutable may finally make their pdf documents truly portable.

While I can create hypertext links that work _within_ an Acrobat document,
though, I can't, at this time, create links to other documents/resources on
the Web. I suppose I'd like to see someone come up with a browser that
could handle both HTML _and_ pdf documents internally, rather than using a
helper application (Acrobat), and could deal with links in those pdf docs
to other WWW resources. That would certainly go a long way towards giving
us pesky graphic designers what we've been noisily clamouring for.

I agree. I think that with Acrobat, even in a stand-alone form, we're
looking at a useful way of deflecting the pressure away from HTML in the
short, and even long, term. If Mosaic Corp. could pre-configure NetScape to
use Acrobat as a helper application (so people wouldn't have to do it
themselves), and add a pointer to Acrobat somewhere in their on-line
documentation, that would be even better.

On Sat, 22 Oct 1994, Internet Presence Inc. wrote, on the inet-marketing
mailing list, regarding the approach Netscape takes to retrieving all of
the graphical elements of a web document all at once:

Sorry, but it is a very big deal indeed. I have great concern over the 
technical implications of this approach and I am not alone.  

What Netscape has done, in a sense, is to abrogate its responsibilities
for efficient behavior at the expense of the network at large and those
who choose to operate http servers. 

Background:

Netscape retrieves the document and as it reads it --character by
character-- immediately initiates requests for all of the graphical
elements on the document as they are seen, opening a socket request for
each element.  Those requests are fulfilled on seperate virtual circuts
and the data then comes crashing down the pipe, to be displayed on the
user's screen.  (Marc, please correct me if I am wrong.)

Effects on Network Infrastructure:

What this does, besides making the retrieval appear to operate faster to
the user, is to create a very bursty network usage profile. 

For example, it is very possible, for a single Netscape document request
to max out a full T-1 for a small, but measurable period of time.  This
will, I suspect, cause Netscape initiated web traffic to operate faster
*AT THE EXPENSE* of all the other network services. 

Effects on HTTP Servers:

This is also very server/provider unfriendly because your server has now
been turned from serving numerous requests at the same time to
potentially serving a single "virtual" request. 

Under Sun/OS, the kernel is preconfigured to provide only 32 IO slots
per process.  When your server (either inetd if you run under that
mechanism or the actual www server itself) receives the requests which
comprise a document with 16 graphical elements on it, that single user
has consumed half of the available IO slots for the length of time it
takes to fulfill the request.  (Yes, I realize you can up the IO slots 
and remake the kernel, that is not the point.)

So, it's really a question of serving multiple users (at the same time)
at an expected rate, or serving fewer users at an improved rate. 

This pushes the performance bottleneck squarely on the shoulders of the
network infrastructure and the service providers which, in a non-metered
network and in the current non-pay environment of the web, is grossly
irresponsible (IMHO).

This conflict reflects the underlying conflict in the purpose of HTML.
While it supposedly describes the structure of a document, it's most
often used to tell a browser how to present a document. I believe that
we're going to keep seeing this conflict until some some means of
unifying the two distinct purposes of HTML is reached.

It was suggested that, in the grand scheme of SGML, HTML is correctly
viewed aas a presentation language that you translate documents in
other SGML DTDs into for display purposes. This seems reasonable, so
long as you keep the goal of being able to lose only presentation
information as you move from platform to platform in mind.

This means that new presentation tags need to be added with some care
as to how they are going to be represented on other browsers, as well
as some care as to how browsers that don't implement them are going to
behave when they see them.

IMG is a good example of ignoring the first criteria - the initial
implementation had no way to replace the missing information, and the
design was such that only a very limiting kludge could solve the
problem. IMAGE show how it's done right - you can bring all the power
of HTML to your aid in constructing the replacement information, and
there's a reminder that you need to do so when you write the thing. It
also has the right property when it's ignored by a browser - users get
the presumably lower-quality information.

CENTER is a good example of ignoring the second criteria. Because it's
a paragraph tag (at least, the only documentation available says it
can be used as one), ignoring it means that you lose paragraph
information. There has been a proposal that it be accepted with the
restriction that it can't directly contain text, which solves the
problem. Except that, unless popular browsers do something very ugly
when that restriction is violated, people will ignore it, and we'll
all lose.

I'm not as concerned, really.  Other than the overhead in opening 
separate TCP connections, it's still the same amount of data.  If
you are totally optimizing for people on the slow end of a 14.4 modem,
then this is the right thing to do in terms of speed - even waiting for
the whole initial document to download before issuing an MGET on the
inlines would be unacceptible in most situations.  

Server performance shouldn't be a problem - most server software I've
dealt with and most platforms I know people are running should easily
be able to handle 3-4 hits/second.  Most server models are pretty good
about concurrent connections, too - those that are started by inetd are
their own processes anyways so there's an unlimited number of those that
can run, those that run as daemons which fork can handle as many concurrent 
connections as memory for the forked processes, and those that run with a
real-time configurable number of concurrent connections have solved that 
problem anyways.  

Bursty network load is the only thing I'd worry about.

Well actually, one thing I think they've done is demonstrate a fundamental
weakness in the HTTP/inline image model.  One solution that is in line
with the talk here and on the HTTP working group list is that servers 
could combine their documents and inline images into a MIME document, 
multiplexing the elements into fixed-size chunks of something small like 
2Kbytes apiece or something.   I don't know what the overhead would be in
that, but if it could be reduced to below that of the TCP connection 
overhead, it's a win.  So, if you had:

1. a 6K document (a)
2. a 10K inlined image (b)
3. a 2K inlined image (c)

The document would look something like this:

2k of a
2k of b
2k of c
2k of a
2k of b
2k of a
2k of b
2k of b
2k of b

An additional optimization would be to not multiplex inline images in
until the reference for the inlined image appears in the document itself.
I.e., if c appeared in the document half-way through, its position would 
be #5 rather than #3, thus a document's download could be aborted at any
time and you wouldn't have lots of extra bits that you don't have a home
for.


Benefits: downloads are one continuous stream, a single server action
	  document authors can start thinking of their document and images
		as one complete whole
	  having 10 2K inlined images is now totally equivalent to having
		1 20K image, giving the document author much more 
		flexibility.

Drawbacks: server-side assembly is computationally expensive 
	   (well, the server can cache it, though, or not do it when instructed).
	   requires changes to both servers and clients.  HTTP/2.0, anyone?

Just to clarify - the number of simultaneous TCP connections is 
configurable at run time in Mozilla, the default being 5 I believe.
Also, for which servers does the above model hold?  Sounds like
it only holds for a multithreaded daemon like MDMA.

Do you have the statistics to back up these claims?

How do you know that this behavior will not increase
overall network throughput?

In my opinion, the technical implications have been with us for a long time,
ever since people started playing with whimsical inlined images. The root
problem is not in efficent/piggy (take your pick, I view it as efficient but
I have heard some people call it "piggy") browsers, but rather in people
polluting the data environment with irrelevant glitz.

(Not to mention that we should all be using caches anyhow, thus saving a lot
of bandwidth.)

	We (people running servers, especially those running commercial ones!) 
	should be happy that the end users will be getting documents faster. 
	Some would call this progress!  Bandwidth can be bought easily enough
	and making good use of it, as NetScape and WebExplorer do, should be
	seen as something good.  Server overload (if you are indeed running
	a *very* slow very) is a good problem to have in my opinion.  Because
	it can be fixed easily.  Fixing clients is *much* harder!

	In a non-threaded request data would still be "crashing down the pipe"
	due to the fact that most serious HTTP servers are connected by higher

	The same is true for other net services.. It's possible for FTP

	as well, what else is new?

	What's the difference?  If the user is going to access your HTML 
	document (let's say 4 independent requests, 3 of which are graphics)
	what is the overall difference in server load?  In either situation
	your server will experience 4 independent requests.  Those requests
	are not all batched up and sent once using the old way.  For all 
	the techies, please excuse the 	simplification:

	Old way:
	
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the HTML text.
	C: ok.. Got it.
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the GIF.
	C: ok.. Got it.
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the GIF.
	C: ok.. Got it.
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the GIF.
	C: ok.. Got it.

	New way:

	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the HTML text.
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the GIF.
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the GIF.
	S: Hey, Mr. HTTPD sent me the GIF.

	C: ok.. Got it..
	C: ok.. Got it..
	c: ok.. Got it..
	C: ok.. still getting it.. ;)

	As we all know, the old way makes you wait until the client gets
	everything before showing *you* the person anything.  Whereas the
	new browsers allow you to view the results from the initial 
	requests.  Again, this seems like a cool way to do things, it's 
	just like the threads in an OS.  Why should a process wait for
	some other subprocess to exit before it can finish its own work
	or start another subprocess?  It should be plain to see the 
	advantages of this..

	So based on the above, if 32 people access your machine at once
	then your server crashes?  Some how I don't think that's the case.

	I think "grossly irresponsible" is a bit strong.  People with 14.4

	"grossly irresponsible".. 

	This is an interesting discussion topic and I'd love to hear why

In theory, multiple simultaneous connections are a good idea; high-performance
servers are designed to perform well even when dealing with large numbers of 
simultaneous connections. However, there are some problems with this approach.

The first problem occurs when networks start to become congested. TCPs congestion
control algorithms will will limit the damage, but because of the large number
of independently flow-controlled connections, will tend to back off far more
than would otherwise occur, giving much reduced throughput. 

Another problem which is not mccs fault is caused by a bug in the TCP 
implementation used by most commercial SYS V.4 releases. This bug causes 
sockets to get stuck in close states when large numbers of connections 
come in. This is the root of the problem that brought the NCSA ftp server 
offline a while back, and is still a major headache on sunsite (there are 
fixes in the offing from most vendors, but it looks like a hard problem). 

At the moment it would probably be a good idea to disable the parallel gets
from netscape. If people are having real problems with servers going down, I
can also post some WEBTHRA patches for NCSA and CERN to send error messages
informing people about the o/s bugs when accessed by the problematic version
of netscape. This isn't really a good solution to the problem (it's the O/S
vendors fault, not MCC), and IBM is about to release a browser that does the 
same thing, which would need yet another fix, but it should serve for 
damage limitation.

MDMA tells solaris to let if have as many file descriptors as it wants- 
(this did lead to an amusing bug when a cgi script called sendmail, which
then tried to close all available file descriptors- cgi scripts called by MDMA
are reset to the default number of file descriptors). 

As for the other points - some of then are addressed in my previous message;
issues relating to HTTP/2.0 and 3.0 were discussed extensively at the HTTP BOF
in Chicago, and I'm going to be working with Dave Ragget down at the HP labs
in Bristol to try out some sample implementations before the IETF meeting 
in December

That's not implied at all.  It's not a question of whether or not it looks
good, it's a question of whether or not the document's creator has control
over the appearance.

We shouldn't forget that HTML is also trying to be a user interface
description language, too.  That's something that neither structured text
nor page description does well.  That's why I've brought up the question
here about HTML becoming part of a larger body of UI description language.

What I think is being confused here in the big picture of this
argument is the purpose and place of standards.

The real point of the HTML standard is to make sure that different browsers
are able to read HTML files and display them and to the best of my knowledge
*NONE* of the Mozilla extensions violate the HTML spec, specifically:
    3.4.4  Undefined Tag and Attribute Names
    ...
    The behavior of WWW applications reading HTML documents and
    discovering tag or attribute names which they do not understand
    should be to behave as though, in the case of a tag, the whole
    tag had not been there but its content had, or in the case of an
    attribute, that the attribute had not been present.

    http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/spyglass-19941014/HTMLSPEC_10.html

[There was some question in my mind that font attributes being
 cumulative (i.e., <B><I>foo</I></B> yeilds bold-italic) was legal
 but, to my surprise, it seems to be allowed by the DTD.]

Mozilla also does not seem to violate the spirit of this intention in that
existing browsers are perfectly able to display documents that use the
Mozilla extensions (and if they can't they are badly broken).

So I don't really see what all the fuss is about.  If the HTML standard
doesn't want to follow Mozilla and defines some other solution then fine.
If it doesn't provide an alternative then fine.  What's the big deal?
We certainly don't need to get off on the "what's an open system"
tangent here (an open question if I've ever heard one).

[BTW: this isn't my original thinking, I got this from Dan C.
 I just did a little research and wrote it up.  Thanks Dan]

My, how quickly history is rewritten; <P> has never marked the end of a
paragraph.  The rule was that <P>'s and </P>'s should be implied where
they are obvious.  That was probably a bad idea but that has no bearing
on this issue.

So the text:
    <H1>header</H1>
    some text
    <UL><LI>item</UL>
    more text<P>
    the end
should translate to:
    <H1>header</H1>
    <P>some text</P>
    <UL><LI>item</LI></UL>
    <P>more text</P>
    <P>the end</P>

You can't just put <CENTER>...</CENTER> around arbitrary sections.
See the various SGML discussions about marking sections of text.

Specifically, this is highly illegal and problematical:
	<CENTER>
	<H1>...</H1>
	</CENTER>

The fact that it will not work as presented puts a pretty good damper on
it as a serious proposal.  I suppose that is what is "so hard" about it :-)

There are 10's if not 100's of important presentation issues totally
bypassed by taking this approach and adding more and more kludges will
just make things unmanagable.  Ever heard of creaping featursim?  Well
guess what...

I'm *not* an SGML purist by any stretch of the imagination (I don't even
know that much about it really) but it's clear to me that the proposals
like <CENTER> aren't solutions to the real problems.

If we are going to add presentation cues inside HTML then I propose
that we do it in an organized manor.  Not by adding random tags
as we see fit.

Also, why hasn't someone implemented stylesheets?  The groundwork has been
done already; it's not like it's an unsolved problem or anything.  The
code isn't that complex (even the CERN linemode browser has some of the
basics already).

Some very good points.  I'll address one side of the problem here.

The main missing feature I think is that clients don't currently have any
way to specify what format you want.  It would also be extremely helpful
if clients had some way to ask the server what formats it is able to
provide for a given document.  This could be done with HEAD by adding a
new object header:
    Formats: text/plain,text/html,application/postscript
This is just off the cuff.

Once it's in place then providers would not waste their time doing it
manually (nobody *wants* to put multiple links for the same data).
Sadly this could take a long while to become standard.  The WWW is a victim
of it's own success here.

The server part of this doesn't have to be very complex.

Amen!  And the "Click"'s also.

HTML with tables should not be called text/html, it should be something
like ``x-html-tbl''.  As I previously posted it will be nigh impossible
to sort out dozens of different independent formats (tables, math, figures,
etc) collected under a single text/html umbrella.  It will never fly.

> Ideally, the server would convert the table to PRE or some such.
If both formats weren't called "text/html" then the server could do that
without too much trouble (kind of like Plexus does with Setext -> HTML).

More importantly I think is that we have to make it easy for
users to select the format of their choice.

Which is where you get into problems with the above scheme.  What's wrong
with giving each unique type a unique name (i.e. x-mozilla-html) That's
much easier than trying to make a server understand all kinds of different
pieces and how they might fit together (can you say AI).

That's what Accept: is supposed to be for.

A big source of the tension in the past was that HTML was the only way we
had to do URIs (i.e. hypertext) on the WWW.  Very shourtly we will have 3
choices that support hypertext in WWW:

PDF - for those who care the most about presentation  (Is anyone working on
a forms POST interface for PDF?)

SGML - for those who care about content markup and user editing

HTML - the general purpose compromise that has features for both the
presentation crowd and the markup crowd and satisfies neither.

There is no need to make HTML overly complex given these alternatives.  I hope
that it stays a nice simple compromise  - a simple output language in
structure markup clothing.

Won't this force competitors to do the same, bringing everyone back to a
level playing field, while improving the *perceived* performance of the
clients (which is a good UI feature)?

Couldn't you make the same argument against people using T-1s vs. people
using 14.4 connections, since the people with T-1s will request the various
elements faster?  So we should all go back to really slow connections, with
the salutory effect of reducing the burstiness of the network and servers?
I just don't think so.

	How do I tell a client to reload a page rather than
using the page in cache?  I have some scripts that I
want clients to rerun rather than fetching stale data
from the cache.  I don't want the client to click 'reload'
because the links don't always both to themselves but
to other scripts that have already been called and cached.
	This problem occurs with the Mac and PC
versions of Mosaic.
	I've appended nph- to the beginning of the
script name (I'm using NCSA httpd v1.3) and have my
scripts return the following headers:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK

rest of output deleted

	Basically I'm setting the Expires date equal to
the creation date.  But MacMosaic and MacWeb continue
to retrieve the file from cache!  Mosaic for X works just
fine though, both before and after I started sending the Expires
info.  I added a unique Message-id as well but that didn't
do any good.

You're wrong.  By default, Netscape only uses a maximum of four
simultaneous connections at once.  I don't know what WebExplorer does.

Thanks Marc for pointing out my error.  However, if I were to change the 
default setting in Netscape's ini file to 50, for example, would that 
have the expected effect?

Have you any statistical data on the effect this retrieval strategy has 
on network resources?

It is important that browsers properly ignore tags that they do not
understand. The HTML DTD is  extensible with additional tags for purposes
of specialist browsers, e.g. for versioning.

So-called 'strict' checking for unknown tags must always be an option
so that maximum downwards compatibility is maintained.

This is not a question of what extensions become 'standards' but rather
of the importance of downwards compatibility. Documents may well contain
information that is of relevance to the specialiast functionality of some
browsers and irrelevant to others. It is important that the such documents
can be viewed with all browsers.

The problem with this solution is that I don't see any way to allow

I fail to see how Netscape is any worse that the original Mosaic when
it came out - remember all the people saying how Mosaic alone with all its
inlined GIFs was chewing up network and server bandwidth?  Well its been
a few years now and people have gotten used to the relatively large
amount of bandwidth/resources that Mosaic causes.  Netscape now ups the
bar even more - so what?  If you want to see a real bandwith hog, 
check out the Internet multicast channels - live video and audio over
the Internet certainly chews up a lot more bandwidth and processing 
power than anything Netscape can do.

Just because a company releases an Internet application that uses a lot
of resources does not, in my mind, make them irresponsible.  I think
where you are coming from, Rob, is that the Internet is a shared resource
and we should all respect this resource and tred on it lightly.  

I don't agree.  We all pay for this resource to some Internet service
provider who has the responsibility to provide adequate network
bandwidth for whatever we want to do with the net.  Exactly like
paying for telephone service - while we don't think of the voice 
telephone network as a shared resource, it is (bottlenecks being 
switching capacity and long distance trunk line capacity).  You don't
hear anyone complaining when IBM sets up a huge call response center
with 500 telephone lines.  You don't hear about it because IBM pays for
it and the telcos involved make sure that their network can deliver
capacity to both IBM and all the one line households in the same area.

If you're worried about how Netscape will impact web space providers,
well ths choice is simple - either keep up with the technology (ie.
get a Unix machine with better i/o performance), or don't operate
a web server.  Nobody is forcing you to operate a web server.

And this is one of the fundamental problems with this package.  We're
getting people here setting this to 12 or 14 or more (or 100 for all I
know - I wonder what the limit is!).   It's definitely effecting our
largest server, and I'm in the process of going through analysis of how
bad it actually is coming out to be.  Even at *2* it seems to be
pretty devastating to our CERN proxy server, but we'll get some better
stats soon. If anyone out there already has some definitive stats one way
or the other on this issue, I'd also really appreciate it.

We're also not happy about the fact that people's user id's are being
grabbed off the host and inserted into the headers (and in fact their
entire email address will be sent if the email "from" is properly
filled out) FROM field, which is passed in *every* transaction with
no way to turn this off other than put "-" in the from address (or
"robert.e.allen@att.com" in my case - but I guess you can map from that
now...).  What happened to all the privacy discussions or have they
moved elsewhere (in our case, and I suspect many other large orgs,
this is also a violation of our security policies)?

I'll vote against CENTER, but DIVISION has some merit.

Introducing a new element with no other function than to center text
seems rather a step backwards. HTML should try to capture the
underlying *function* of the text that is to be centered:

  - if it is a quote, use QUOTE
  - if it is an abstract, use ABSTRACT
  - if it is a note, use NOTE
  - if it is a title use H*
  - if it is a formula, use MATH

Of course, there will always be situations where none of the above
fits. Therefore, there has to be some general `fallback' element.
Like the first three above -- and like Joe English proposed -- it
should be an element that contains other elements (i.c. P's), but not
text. Note that the %pextra feature is of no help here.

However, I don't like the name DIVISION, it suggests a much larger
chunk of text and it can easily be confused with DIV*. How about
DISPLAY?

And, to add another attribute to the proposal: how about ROLE:

  <!element DISPLAY (P*) -- other displayed text -->
  <!attlist DISPLAY

       -- common attributes --
       ID      ID      #IMPLIED -- link destination --
       CHARSET CDATA   #IMPLIED -- eg "ISO-2022-JP" for japanese --
       ALIGN   (dontcare|left|center|right) dontcare -- formatting hint --

       -- role examples: screendump, example-sentence, code --
       ROLE    CDATA   #IMPLIED -- the function of this element -->

This would preserve the capability of HTML to be used as a database,
instead of as a PDL.

Adobe and Spyglass recently announced a partnership of sorts.  Acrobat 2.0

allows
Web developers to create documents in a professional design environment, send
them through the Acrobat 2.0 Distiller ($1,599), and then manually insert
hyperlinks
which in fact point to other Web resources -- either an HTML page, an
executable URL, or
another Acrobat file.  When a user has opened the Acrobat file through the
Spyglass
browser, Acrobat then works with S-Mosaic if a user clicks on an Internet
based hyperlink
within the Acrobat document.

I think this about solves it.

Now, we need this standardized.  Good luck . . . .

Hi,

Thanks in advance for any replies ...

Is anyone using glimpsehttp on solaris 2.3 to index and search the contents
of their server?  I am trying to install this here without success and have
almost given up on the glimpse list (I've written several messages all of
which have been kept by the moderators - I've actually recieved one
message in three weeks from the list!).  If anyone has installed
glimpsehttp or is trying to on solaris 2.x then please e-mail me.

There are postscript viewers at least that can be fired off by Mosaic or
perhaps even Netscape (I haven't tested this).  HTML can't play all things
to all people - all it can do is provide a methodology for including
simple formatting information in documents.  Browsers then render these
documents according to their own rules.

I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that selfishness is not doing what you

To Online-News & WWW-Talk:

As is well known to all on these lists by now, one of the Internet's first 
well publicized commercial ventures, MecklerWeb, has taken a drastic turn. 
 In fact, it could be said that it no longer exists, at least along the 
lines of the original principles outlined by Christopher Locke.

These events are of no surprise, of course.

Since these events raise a number of important questions for the Internet 
community, I felt it appropriate to begin a discussion in primary groups of 
interest.

MecklerWeb was destined to fail.  It was from the beginning a reflection of 
the belief in the Internet equivailant of a centralized information service. 
 While it certainly allowed for technical deployment to be distributed, it 
assumed that an umbrella would be necessary to bring together disparate 
though associative organizations.  Furthermore, MecklerWeb provided a far 
too broad topology for these associations, instead of cultivating certain 
domains as a distributed commercial and electronic environment allows so 
well.

In the end, MecklerWeb looked like a $25,000 directory service, offering 
little additional technology or content advantages.

In a globally distributed commercial electronic environment, the need for 
building "virtual associations", if you will, becomes entirely unnecessary. 
 The vision of Chris Locke was interesting, though his notion that pointers 
on the Web could fulfill the vision was wrong.

In the recent COOK report (The COOK Report special issue of October 17, 
1994), Locke identifies the following vision as the impetus for MecklerWeb:

"MecklerWeb was founded on several principles, many of them
contrary to the received wisdom about markets and marketing
in conventional media.  We said that, on the Internet, advertising
was not the opportunity many imagined it to be.  We said it
wouldn't work here, period.  Instead, we said that "corporate
content" was not an oxymoron; that companies possessed
genuine knowledge that would be of real and immediate value to
the audiences now assembling in this medium.  We said that
companies wishing to build new business relationships with
these potential micro-markets could accomplish that only by
offering their insight, experience, knowledge and perspective --
without charge -- to people who come to the net looking for
something other than the hand waving and hucksterism that
have characterized the mass media.  We said companies could
learn much from the environment of open discourse that has
developed on the Internet, and that they would gain much by
contributing to it.  We said it was time that the private sector
gave something back to the community that has created this
unparalleled resource with little thought of personal gain.  All
this is well documented."

This vision is not wrong, though it is almost entirely misplaced.
Technologically, there is no reason why a placement system such as 
MecklerWeb would provide any solution to these needs.  In fact, the 
"concept" of MecklerWeb is in essence the concept of the commercial Internet 
as a whole, which is in fact MecklerWeb's achillies heel.  By stating the 
obvious possibilities of an advanced global distributed network, Chris 
correctly identified an incentive for getting on the Internet, without 
recognizing that companies would not need a special place beyond the 
Internet itself.

Furthermore, the real solutions to the above vision come not by way of some 
hazy and underdeveloped Web site, but in the development of higher-end 
Desktop-PC based collaborative information sharing and conferencing tools. 
 Currently technology on the Web cannot solve these problems, at least with 
much simplicity for the average end-user.  And, valuable directory services 
are almost non-existant, though would solve enormous problems both for 
navigation and for the development of true commerce on the Internet.

On the other hand, Locke's vision was also quite wrong, in my opinion.  His 
notion that (1) vertical markets somehow would not drive commercial interest 
in the Internet, and (2) that sponsorship was not a viable option.

First, as most would agree, the opportunities on the Internet are almost 
completely in vertical markets, and, in fact, it's distributed nature is 
what drives this.  While there will certainly be opportunies for mass-appeal 
content and services, much of its growth will be driven by the accessibility 
of high-quality content within clearly identified niches.  To a certain 
degree, it will be newspapers and their equivailent in the magazine world 
that will drive horizontal markets, not "collectives" of information 
providers within a system such as MecklerWeb.

Second, and a corallary of the first point, is that sponsorship is the only 
reasonable model for the development of the Internet as a commercial medium. 
 It is simply impossible to assume that a content provider will be able to 
bear the costs of providing a low-cost, if not free service to the Internet 
community.  While clearly defined value-added information, such as database 
services like Nexus, Info-Seek, etc., will require per-use or higher-cost 
fee structures, other content will not be able to follow this model.

Publications that are interested in moving onto the Internet will be 
overwhelmed with cost of delivering a viable commercial publication -- it is 
not a simple, and discretionary expense, it is a complex and very costly 
service to provide.  As such, content providers are faced with the difficult 
task of finding a cost-recovery system that can work.  As most people know, 
trials to this point in time have failed, almost entirely.

Here's why they have failed:

First, the model of a free service with no sponsorship puts the burden of 
cost entirely on the content provider.  For smaller services, this may be 
sufficient, though is very unlikely to produce enough interest in the 
company or the paper publication to actually justify the cost.  This model 
is worth only as much as the PR they receive.

Second, the model of a for-fee service with no sponsorship assumes that 
people are willing to pay monthly fees for access to content in cyberspace. 
 This, for the most part, we know to be wrong.  The CompuServe, Prodigy, and 
AOL model is quickly be replaced by the Internet model, and, with the 
exception of value-added databases, few people are willing to pay anything 
for access to standard company or publication content.  As with the first 
model, this too is likely to fail, especially when content provider attempt 
to deploy more sophisticated services.

My own assessment is that if commercial sponsorship does not very soon 
become a major part of Internet services, we will see little progress, both 
in terms of content delivered and quality of service.  The ability to 
provide value-added advertising and company information within clearly 
defined vertical markets is both viable from both a commercial/advertiser 
perspective and from the end-user's perspective as well.

I won't go on any further, and I open the floor to debate.

Hi there! I have a (silly?) question about URL syntax... Here at my 
University we have some http servers, all of them running NCSA's HTTPD 
1.3. With Mosaic (I mean, NCSA Mosaic) everything works fine, but when I 
use Lynx (Lynx 2.2 on an AIX system) the following URL gives some trouble:

     http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo

In fact, the problem is not with this particular URL, but with a partial 
URL in the index.html file in ~mmagallo. I have something like

     <a href="HTML/html_primer.html">Whatever</a>

Mosaic seems to understand that this is

     http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo/HTML/html_primer.html

but Lynx 2.2 gives

     http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagalloHTML/html_primer.html

If I start Lynx with the command:

     lynx http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo/

instead of

     lynx http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo

everything goes ok.

Now, the question is, wich URL is the right one, the one with the trailing 
/ or the one without it? I've read all the URL documentation I know about 
(mostly the documents at NCSA and CERN) and it's not clear (at least to 
me) if that / should or shouldn't be there.

(Don't ask why they still use Lynx 2.2... this is the computer center, at 
my department, wich is Physics, we use 2.3)

BTW, these pages are under construction, this particular one is a 
"Bookmark file" or "Hotlist", so I don't really think you are interested, 
but if you want, you're welcome to take a look at them.

Thanks!

No, I disagree. Look at those documents out there that use illegal HTML, 
browser-specific assumptions, etc to achieve a particular visual effect. How 
many, as a percentage,  are static pages without any links? Yup, thought so.

That is how many PDF will be useful for, right now, in stand alone form.

Yes it may well do, once they are available. I looked
on <http://www.verity.com/getAcrobat.html> and saw viewers for DOS, MS Windows, 
Mac and Suns (OS and windowing system unspecified). No use for me with a choice 
of HP, SGI and IBM workstations. No use to many of the Sun users either, 
depending on which of the two popular Sun OS's and three Sun windowing systems 
it uses. Aparently there are font licensing problems that have held back 
development of the DOS and Unix versions.

And even then, no URL hyperlinks.

Sure, once that happens we are in a different situation. PDF would then meet the 
needs of many of the people who not unreasonably want to apply document design 
principles to their online documents. If HTML files can point to PDF files and 
PDF files can point to HTML documents and they all come up in a single browser 
so that the casual user sees no particular difference, then fine, I will agree, 
much of the heat will be taken off HTML and it can go on being a simple glue 
language for noddy unstructured hypertext documents (grin).

Until that happens, HTML will get used for hypertext document design because 
that is all there is, folks. Nothing else has the cross platform appeal, Web 
links, and massive installed viewer base.

Interesting to see what happens to HTML 3.0 if PDF-Web comes out first. 

I saw a quote this morning that said Adobe were committed to adding Web link 
ability to PDF; can't find it now though ;-) oh well.

Lastly of course there is the issue of what happens when the majority of the Web 
shifts from using an Open document format to a proprietary one....

Ok Phil, forgive me if I interpret your words in slightly different way:

	If you're worried about how Netscape will impact your web site,
	--which you provide as a public service or as a labor of love-- 
	make sure you keep up with the technology because the tools
	are now going to assume that you are fully responsible for the
	performance bottlenecks. 

I can see this being a real damper on the provision of free information 
resources on the net.  Mosaic and Netscape have significantly up-ed
the ante when it comes to providing content on the net and I believe
that we can all agree that it is not the technology which is the real
value here, it is the content.  We need to be enabling content
providers, not looking to them to shoulder the entire technological
burden. 

But what really worries me, I think, is that design decisions seem to
be made with the idea that we can do anything we want because the
network will react by becoming faster and more efficient.  I do not
believe this to be the case. 

And even if this appears to be the case now, there must be a point
where this assumption will cause the providers of the network to
radically change its economic model.

Without understanding the implications of technology, we may end up
inadvertantly creating the pressures that will drive the net to 
something we will all regret, like packet charges.

Subject:       html HEAD and current html spec
Priority: normal

content-length: 1254

What is genereal status og the HEAD element in HTML, most 
implementations that I have seen do nothing with it? I assume people
are planning on using it. Can any one fill me in better on this? I 
recall some discussion on this a while ago but it slipped into my bit 
bucket :(

also where can I get a relavant set of HTML specs and HTTP specs
I have read the older internet drafts from Tim Berners-Lee but these 
seem pretty old and outdated ( no offense meant ). I know there must 
be some drafts for HTML+/ HTML2.0 or even HTML3.0.

Ditto for HTTP

Most of the definitions are pretty vague in the old 
expired internet drafts. Do I just have read ALL the source code from 
ALL the client/servers to get the definative usage, unfortunately 
I've already done that :( AACK ).

I am trying to create some apps and I don't want to step on existing 
potential capabilities hidden in the spec ( or code if thats the 
definative standard ) 


where the docs? ( kinda like wheres the beef :)

thanks in advance

Subject: Re: Cascading HTML style sheets -- a proposal
Cc: www-talk@www0.cern.ch
content-length: 6347

Before this stylesheet talk freezes again, let me point out yet another
stylesheet proposal (enclosed below). The first time it was posted to 
www-talk a year ago. At the time I think I had gotten like 3 or 4 replies
out of it. Maybe that'll be more interest this time :)

At this point, however, there is some preliminary implementation of the
stylesheet mechanism (in viola). The code is written as a library 
independent of viola, so if this stylesheet mechanism is acceptable,
it shouldn't be hard for other browsers to reuse the code.

To see what it can do now, have a look at an actual example (screendump
of the effects, the markup used, and the influencing stylesheets):

        http://pebble.berkeley.ora.com/vdoc/style/sample.html


Some random comments regarding H&kon's proposal:

I'm intrigued by the effects of the cascading effects. I've a feeling
that there'll be certain situation where this fuzzy mixing effect
would look interesting and useful. Like trying to tone down the 
differences in font sizes from document to document so that there aren't 
TOO many fonts being used. Quantization for font? 

Also, the macro language could pehaps help to decide certain things.
Like it could help to decide switching to different presentation styles
depending on the condition of the browser? (not very considered comment) 

Neat as it is, though, it seems like a big can or worm, especially at 
this early point when we're tring to get people to use it at all. 
I suggest such macro/scripting language be kept in mind, but postponed
for the first cut. Atleast until we've some experience with it a little.

As I'm experimenting with the stylesheets in violaWWW, I noticed that
by mixing different stylesheets, it's very easy to have the styles
clashing in a bad way. Consequently I end up using stylesheets to 
take over the entire styling effects, or have to be very conscious of 
the effects of the mixing.

Now, some questions which I had raised on Rob Raisch's stylesheet RFC.
The same questions seem to apply to yours as well:

With this language, how is context sensitivity dealt with? How do you
say that a paragraph's style differs depending on whether it's inside
of ADDRESS of not? Ie: there should be a way to specify that Paragraphs
inisde of ADDRESS should be aligned to the right, but would be aligned 
to the left as by default. Note the P's and LI's in the sample stylesheet
below.


Here's that old stylesheet proposal.
(also in http://pebble.berkeley.ora.com/vdoc/style/stylesheetRFC.txt)
==========================================================================
Stylesheet RFC, Oct 23 1993                     Pei Y. Wei (pei@ora.com)
                                                O'Reilly & Associates

The first part of this document describes the language used to describe
the mapping between tags and style properties, and the interpretation 
of the language.

The second part contains a style properties definition.

The third part describes the API to a library code for parsing 
stylesheets and for resolving property queries, and sample API calls.


The Stylesheet Description Language
-----------------------------------

Everything not in quotes is case insensitive.

Sample stylesheet:

(HEAD,BODY                              fontSize=normal
                                        BGColor=white
                                        FGColor=black
    (H1                                 fontSize=largest
                                        BGColor=red
                                        FGColor=white)
    (H2                                 fontSize=large)
    (P)
    (A                                  FGColor=red)
    (CMD,KBD,SCREEN,LISTING,EXAMPLE     fontSpacing=mono)
    (BOLD,EMPH,STRONG                   fontWeight=bold)
    (I                                  fontSlant=italic)
    (ADDRESS
        (P                              fontSlant=italic))
    (OL
        (LI                             numStyle=roman
            (LI                         numStyle=number
                (LI                     numStyle=alpha)
            )
        )
    )
    (FOOTNOTE                           fontSize=small
        (P)
    )
)

>From this stylesheet, you can derive the following information:

* <P> inside of <HEAD> and <BODY> gets fontSize of "normal".
* <P> inside of <ADDRESS> gets italic slant font.
* <P> inside of <FOOTNOTE> gets a "small" font.
* List items in first, second, and third levels are numbered differently.
* Since <BOLD> and <STRONG> look the same, they are succintly lumpped
  together.

Note that properties are inherited down the tree, unless overridden.
So, the color information that is specifed at the top is used all over,
except for <H1> which redefines its own colors. 

Having this inheritance behaviour also helps to keep the description
short, as lots of information can be derived by the context in the 
tree structure.

The lone "(P)"s are there to engage the respective <P> tags to be in
those particular contexts. 

A document uses a <LINK REL="STYLE" HREF="URL_to_a_stylesheet">
to associate to a stylesheet. It's an open question as to whether
we should allow multiple stylesheets in a document, and where
this link can be specified (once only, in the <HEAD>?).
==========================================================================


One more thing not mentioned in the above RFC. There should be a way to 
take attributes into account. For example, to make the following markup 
be rendered with red text and boxed in orange border.

        <P STYLE="WARNING">Spike on duty</P>

You'd write the style spec this way (in my syntax):

        (P                                      BGColor=white
                                                FGColor=black
                {STYLE "WARNING"                FGColor=red
                                                BDColor=orange})



BTW, because two of the three replies that I had got from my RFC was to
the effect of "use FOSSI or atleast SGML", I want to say that at this 
point I'm treating my non-SGML stylesheet language as an experiment. 
I'll probably convert the syntax into SGML (had started editing the 
FOSSI DTD into something minimal). There are good reasons for using SGML
for this... so that's another thing to think about.

Subject: Unicode and HTML
content-length: 732

A week or two ago, the subject of Unicode and HTTP/HTML came up.
Then it died.  Is this because its utility is so obvious that no-
body considered it worth discussing?  Or is it because implemen-
ting Unicode on current procrustean systems is so unrealistic
that the issue was simply ignored?  Something in-between?

Also, what ever happened to the issue of language and encoding
tags?  Some said that language tags were unnecessary.  Others said
that Unicode would *make* them unnecessary (which is false, even
according to the Unicode standard itself).  Still others thought
the whole issue of multilingual text to be far too arcane to be
worth worrying about at this juncture.

The whole point of SGML and such systems is to abstract away from most
appearance issues.  If you try to make SGML (or HTML) into TeX, you'll
be defeating its whole purpose, and probably destroying its simplicity
and portability as well.

   The main missing feature I think is that clients don't currently have any
   way to specify what format you want.  It would also be extremely helpful
   if clients had some way to ask the server what formats it is able to
   provide for a given document.  This could be done with HEAD by adding a
   new object header:
       Formats: text/plain,text/html,application/postscript
   This is just off the cuff.

Close, but not quite.  A single URL is (almost certainly) in exactly
one format .  (Though one could imagine a smart server returning
different datatypes depending on information passed in the Accept
field).  What you want, I think, is something more like a URC.  You
send a URN, and the server tells you what formats it is available in.

This, by the way, is just what Dienst (the technical report server
developed by Carl Lagoze and myself) does.  For a demo see
http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu/

We have submitted an Internet Draft for the Dienst protocol and
would be grateful for any criticism.


It would be nice if the client could also tell the server something
about its display capabilities in the negotiation, e.g. if the
client is running on a monochrome display there's no use sending
the greyscale images.

   More importantly I think is that we have to make it easy for
   users to select the format of their choice.

Or better yet, for their client (which they have pre-programmed) to
select for them.

This clause is there to allow for older stuff not following the
standard. It was not put there to give a carte blanche to arbitrary
new additions to the standard.

My solution: 

 Use the suggested <p align="center">Center me!</p> and bitch to MCOM
 that their browser(s) doesn't display this correctly.

Marc Andreesens html-mode use it to mark the end of paragraph. That
particular little emacs mode and the HTML documents found at NCSA is
to blame for a lot of bogus HTML documents around the Web.

Not true.  Take, for example, the instance where I have an external viewer
for Targa images, but my browser can't handle them internally (or I don't
want it to, since Targa images tend to be large - perhaps I only want to
allow GIFs.)

Agreed.  It seems like the HTML version, plus a "level" parameter would be
sufficient.  It won't determine every little feature supported on the
client, but it will allow the level of support for standardized features
to be determined by the server.

Seems to be the smartest thing to do, for experimental stuff like a
document making heavy use of the new NetScape tags.  In answer to those
who say, "then we'll have 50 million 'x-<insert-client-name>-html' types",
I say not really, because any tags of value will probably make their way
into the standard, and will then become part of the level specifications.

Again, inlined images (and the types that may be supported for them) are
not necessarily the same as externally-handled images.  Another example is
that I may want to limit the size of inlined images via the q, mxb and msx
parameters to the Accept-inline (or what) line, while I'll take anything
for externally handled images.

Just a few random thoughts...

I think that the best data for determining how a server will 
respond to multiple requests can best be described by the method
that a depth based robot/worm searches the web. How well do we deal 
with that extreme and how close to that extreme is Netscape?

Where do you draw the line and say depth based robots/worms are bad but
Netscape using x number of connections is ok?

What is a good number?

IMHO the worms that I have encountered tend to look for a file
that says robots aren't welcome here. I think that servers should
add a response that says only x number of simultaneous connections
are wanted here and the browser should abide by this limit, not
requiring the server to force a limit. If we are all courteous about
this, we may increase the burst rate some, but we won't have
the house of cards fall on us for not respecting others' resources.

Are you saying that your proxy server barfs at 2 simultaneous connections? 
If so, then you've got a bigger problem than NetScape....

Can you please state what you mean by "devastating". I'm not
doubting your claims, I'd just appreciate an explanation of what
the problem is.

I've noticed that the server at www.cm.cf.ac.uk has seen a huge
surge in requests - they were averaging around 45-55 thousand a
day, now the figure has shot up to 75,000+, answering a request
every 0.75s for most of the day. The increase seemed to come about
at the time Mozilla was announced.

Hyper-TeX - for sophisticated presentation of mathematically

VRML - for 3-dimensional hypermedia (and eventually, distributed

[pardons if you get two copies of this... first didn't seem to get thru]

I'm glad of this thread, and before this stylesheet talk freezes again,
let me point out yet another stylesheet proposal (enclosed below). 
The first time it was posted to www-talk a year ago. At the time I think 
I had gotten like 3 or 4 replies out of it. Maybe that'll be more interest
this time :)

At this point, however, there is some preliminary implementation of the
stylesheet mechanism (in viola). The code is written as a library 
independent of viola, so if this stylesheet mechanism is acceptable,
it shouldn't be hard for other browsers to reuse the code.

To see what it can do now, have a look at an actual example (screendump
of the effects, the markup used, and the influencing stylesheets):

        http://pebble.berkeley.ora.com/vdoc/style/sample.html


Some random comments regarding H&kon's proposal:

I'm intrigued by the effects of the cascading effects. I've a feeling
that there'll be certain situation where this fuzzy mixing effect
would look interesting and useful. Like trying to tone down the 
differences in font sizes from document to document so that there aren't 
TOO many fonts being used. Quantization for font? 

As I'm experimenting with the stylesheets in violaWWW, I noticed that
by mixing different stylesheets, it's very easy to have the styles
clashing in a bad way. Consequently I end up using stylesheets to 
take over the entire styling effects, or have to be very conscious of 
the effects of the mixing.

With this language, how is context sensitivity dealt with? How do you
say that a paragraph's style differs depending on whether it's inside
of ADDRESS of not? Ie: there should be a way to specify that Paragraphs
inisde of ADDRESS should be aligned to the right, but would be aligned 
to the left as by default. Note the P's and LI's in the sample stylesheet
below.


Here's that old stylesheet proposal.
(also in http://pebble.berkeley.ora.com/vdoc/style/stylesheetRFC.txt)
==========================================================================
Stylesheet RFC, Oct 23 1993                     Pei Y. Wei (pei@ora.com)
                                                O'Reilly & Associates

The first part of this document describes the language used to describe
the mapping between tags and style properties, and the interpretation 
of the language.

The second part contains a style properties definition.

The third part describes the API to a library code for parsing 
stylesheets and for resolving property queries, and sample API calls.


The Stylesheet Description Language
-----------------------------------

Everything not in quotes is case insensitive.

Sample stylesheet:

(HEAD,BODY                              fontSize=normal
                                        BGColor=white
                                        FGColor=black
    (H1                                 fontSize=largest
                                        BGColor=red
                                        FGColor=white)
    (H2                                 fontSize=large)
    (P)
    (A                                  FGColor=red)
    (CMD,KBD,SCREEN,LISTING,EXAMPLE     fontSpacing=mono)
    (BOLD,EMPH,STRONG                   fontWeight=bold)
    (I                                  fontSlant=italic)
    (ADDRESS
        (P                              fontSlant=italic))
    (OL
        (LI                             numStyle=roman
            (LI                         numStyle=number
                (LI                     numStyle=alpha)
            )
        )
    )
    (FOOTNOTE                           fontSize=small
        (P)
    )
)

>From this stylesheet, you can derive the following information:

* <P> inside of <HEAD> and <BODY> gets fontSize of "normal".
* <P> inside of <ADDRESS> gets italic slant font.
* <P> inside of <FOOTNOTE> gets a "small" font.
* List items in first, second, and third levels are numbered differently.
* Since <BOLD> and <STRONG> look the same, they are succintly lumpped
  together.

Note that properties are inherited down the tree, unless overridden.
So, the color information that is specifed at the top is used all over,
except for <H1> which redefines its own colors. 

Having this inheritance behaviour also helps to keep the description
short, as lots of information can be derived by the context in the 
tree structure.

The lone "(P)"s are there to engage the respective <P> tags to be in
those particular contexts. 

A document uses a <LINK REL="STYLE" HREF="URL_to_a_stylesheet">
to associate to a stylesheet. It's an open question as to whether
we should allow multiple stylesheets in a document, and where
this link can be specified (once only, in the <HEAD>?).

[other incomplete stuff deleted]
==========================================================================


One more thing not mentioned in the above RFC. There should be a way to 
take attributes into account. For example, to make the following markup 
be rendered with red text and boxed in orange border.

        <P STYLE="WARNING">Spike on duty</P>

You'd write the style spec this way (in my syntax):

        (P                                      BGColor=white
                                                FGColor=black
                {STYLE "WARNING"                FGColor=red
                                                BDColor=orange})



BTW, because two of the three replies that I had got from my RFC was to
the effect of "use FOSSI or atleast SGML", I want to say that at this 
point I'm treating my non-SGML stylesheet language as an experiment. 
I'll probably convert the syntax into SGML (had started editing the 
FOSSI DTD into something minimal). There are good reasons for using SGML
for this... so that's another thing to think about.

I don't understand this.  The load averaged over time will not change just
because somebody is doing simultaneous connections.  The same amount of
data is being transferred either way.  With the caching which is part of
1.0, this amount of data will be *drastically* reduced by using Netscape.

Do a simple chart with 4 users retreiving 4 things (a doc and 3 images) with
a single time unit for all transfers and each user starting at 1 time unit
increments.

old way:
--------
                                    |    4    |
user 1:  aaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbccccccccc|ddddddddd|
user 2:           aaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbb|ccccccccc|ddddddddd
user 3:                    aaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbb|cccccccccddddddddd
user 4:                             |aaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbcccccccccddddddddd

Now if we expand this scenario over infinite time, it is clear that 
the server will stay in time unit 4 and be processing 4 things.

new way:
--------

Each user starts 4 connections in their time slot and finishes.  The constant
load over time is _also_ 4.

This is an overly simplistic look at Web serving but I don't think that it
is entirely out of line.  Our Web server had 250,000 hits yesterday.  A fair
look at the load would be average hits/sec.  This has nothing to do with
parallel versus linear loading.  The only thing that this *might* affect
would be the Maximum load at any given time.  However, with the natural
varience of when people hit a server, my intuition tells me that this would
average out over time as well...

BTW, I have set my # of connections up to 200 and pounded a BSD based
server with no major problems...

For everybody's information, Spyglass contributed this code back to NCSA,
and our Mac Mosaic supports Acrobat too.  (Actually, I'm taking what I'm
told by Adobe on faith as I don't have an Acrobat to test it with!)  This
is an outgrowth of our collaborative efforts in defining the bi-directional
CCI.

Adobe plans no-cost viewer software too.

An official "Thank You" to Spyglass and Adobe!

No, not really. It is an interesting experimental set up but does not really 
solve it.

Main problem is, this is specific to a particular browser. I may well wish to 
use others. I do not want to have to use another browser just to look at links 
from pdf documents. I particularly do not want to have to use a different 
platform.

Other problems, speaking as someone who writes documents for a living: 

> create documents in a professional design
> environment, send them through the Acrobat 2.0 Distiller ($1,599), and then 
> manually insert hyperlinks which in fact point to other Web resources

I would rather my professional design environment actually put in the links 
rather than hacking them by hand. I have hacked into machine generated 
PostScript in the past to get it to do unusual things (like print ;-) ) and I 
do not want to be doing this on a regular basis to maintain documents. Suppose 
I make some small mistake in the original document and have so regenerate the 
PDF? Now I have to hack in all the URLs again. No thanks.

An interesting alternative scenario is WebMaker, where you create FrameMaker 
documents and put the URLs into the original document. Much better.

> Acrobat the

>From this do I deduce that the pdf is displayed in a separate viewer which 
then comunicates in presumably a proprietary way with this particular browser 
to go get the referred-to documents? Not very nice, unless this can be 
extended to all browsers on all platforms.

The original poster had a better idea, with pdf documents being displayed by 
the browser. That means the pdf spec has to be a lot more open, so that people 
can implement compliant browsers. Alternatively, they could be rendered 
externally and then displayed inside the existing browser, much the same way 
thet Chimera (I believe) does inline images.

The point is that the user sees a unified interface, which was the original 
inspiration for the Web concept at CERN

Or the extra load could be the result of "new toy syndrome".
We would have to see the actual stats to know for sure.

A quick check would be to see if the # requests/day has gone up.
If it has, then there is a good chance that you have NTS.

This has been in the HTTP spec for a long time:
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html
If it isn't acceptable at your site then you can deal with it in your
proxy but it shouldn't be a surprise.

I actually hope that other browers follow (wouldn't it be cool if your
reply address was already filled in on forms...).

The potential (emphasis on potential) big deal is as follows.  

If everybody adheres to an accepted standard, then every client can view
all of the information provided by every server.  This is good. 

If one supplier adds some nice superset extensions to the standard and
offers both client and server systems to support the extensions, then
users fall into two categories: those who use just the old standard and
are no worse off than before, and those who use the extended system and
who gain functionality.  Although those using old clients may not be able
to see all of the information provided by new servers, they can regain
total access just by upgrading to the new extended system.  This is also
good.  It is also logically indistinguishable from revisions to an
existing single standard. Either you upgrade or you don't.  Your choice. 

Now, if several suppliers add different nice superset extensions to the
standard, and many different server sites adopt different ones of these,
then NOBODY can see all of the information provided by all of the servers.
This is bad.  But, the situation could be remedied if (a) all of the
different extensions are union compatible, and (b) somebody combines all
of the extensions into a generic client.  This is unlikely.  And, this is
logically indistinguishable from creating a standard through consensus --
something that almost never happens in a rapidly changing market.

It has been argued in non-WWW contexts that the value to users of a
networked collection of resources rises as the square (or some non-linear
function) of the number of resources.  This attracts so many users, that
resources are willing to participate in the collective, rather than go it
alone, because the additional number of users attracted to the whole
system through its great total value more than offsets the numbers lost to
"competitors" (who can also be located through the information
collective).  Economists argue that this is why different airlines are
willing to list their flight information on a shared reservation system,
rather than insisting on going their own way, and on why railroads adopt
the same size track, etc. 

The relevance of this to the WWW community is that much of the growth in
the WWW has probably been due to the non-linear growth in value as the
number of servers expanded.  If we see too many different, conflicting
"improvements," then the single world-wide WEB will begin to split into
many little, less than world-wide mini-webs.  There'll be the aol-web and
the mozilla-web and the sammy's-good-web... 

Stonebraker (Future trends in database systems, 1989. IEEE Transactions on
Knowledge and Data Engineering, 1:33-44) discusses some very similar
issues with regard to the (then) high acceptance of SQL as a data query
standard.  The abstract begins, 

   This paper discusses the likely evolution of commercial data managers
   over the next several years.  Topics to be covered include the
   following. 

      Why SQL has become an intergalactic standard.
      Who will benefit from from SQL standardization.
      Why the current SQL standard has no chance of lasting...

In the paper is a nice presentation of standards, the different ways they
come about, and the different ways they come undone.  In the section
entitled "Why Standard SQL Is Doomed" Stonebraker notes that (a) SQL as it
presently exists does not meet all needs adequately, (b) improvements
to meet many of the needs can be accomplished as nice superset extensions
to standard SQL, (c) the demand for these changes is such that aggressive
vendors will begin incorporating these extensions as they see fit, with an
eye toward meeting perceived demand more than adhering to standards.  

The end result, he predicts, will be: "The extensions will solve problems
that are so important to large classes of users that they will gladly use
the extended capabilities.  In this way, any application that a user
writes for vendor A's system will not run without substantial maintenance
on vendor B's system and vice versa.  This will ensure that application
portability will not occur through SQL."

This prediction may be easily rewritten for the WWW situation: "The
extensions will solve problems that are so important to large classes of
users that they will gladly use the extended capabilities.  In this way,
any HomePage that a user writes using vendor A's extensions will not be
viewable without substantial maintenance on vendor B's client and vice
versa.  This will ensure the breakdown of the great world-wide web into
a myriad of non-interoperable electronic publishing systems."

Maybe this is a merely an inappropriate projection of SQL's problems onto
WWW.  Then again, maybe not.  At least to me it seems that there is a
potentially big deal lurking in the possibility of multiple diverging
improvements.

Hi

They are both correct. This is an error in the Lynx version.

Another question is that I think people should be careful using
pointers to user's home directories. As long as we have to fiddle
around with URLs I think that server administrators have the
responsibility of making as persistent links as possible.

The URL should have the trailing slash.  Given the above I would say that
both browsers are broken.  The algorithim is supposed to be "deleted back
to the last slash then add the partial URL".

So "http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo" + "HTML/html_primer.html" should become
"http://www.ucr.ac.cr/HTML/html_primer.html" (note that ~mmagallo gets
dropped).  At least that is my understanding.

Think about it like this, "http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo/" is *really*
supposed to be like "http://www.ucr.ac.cr/~mmagallo/index.html" (maybe
yours isn't called index.html or maybe it's generated on the fly, doesn't
matter--this is just an explination of how and why).

Some servers will reject access to a directory without a trailing
slash (they issue a redirect the client to correct it).  But, in
general, a directory access should have a trailing slash.

Most of the abuse I've seen is using <Hx> inside of lists and those
documents all have links on them.

And guess who one of the most recent abusers of this is (and who should
know better).  With this example of HTML at http://mosaic.mcom.com/:
	<H2>
	<LI><A HREF="info/newsrelease.html">News Release</A><P>
	<LI><A HREF="info/license.html">The License</A><P>
	<LI><A HREF="info/how-to-get-it.html">How to Get It!</A><P>
	...
	</H2>
Which looks totally crappy on my display (and I'll bet it does on others
also, I can't imagine why anyone would want to do this, it is soooo ugly).
They also use <H6> for what should be no more than <B>.  Sigh.  Anyway,
I've pointed this out to them and (and even got mail back) but it never
got fixed.

I don't see it happening myself unless they give away PDF-Web

That's not true.  The original CERN spec, which BTW never included
a DTD, specified <p> as a paragraph separator and never had a </p>.
Trying to make <p> into a container now IS rewritting history and
breaks many current implementations, and in my opionion is a very
bad idea.  We should try and write the spec to coexist peacefully
with existing practice rather than breaking everything and forceing
rewrites.

You seem to be missing the point Rob.  The total amount of traffic
remains the same.  On a reasonably busy network the differences
in the retreival tactics balance out and there is no difference
in the overall traffic patterns.  If anything, MCOM is helping the
situation by introducing JPEG image compression to dramatically
decrease the total amount of bandwidth needed.  You should be yelling
at the other Web browser writers for not doing anything to reduce
the total amount of bandwidth needed and applauding us for our committment
to help low bandwidth customers.

You also overlook the fact that Netscape's caching mechanism is far superior
to that of X Mosaic and similar browsers.  Did you know that X Mosaic
retransfers a document every time you click on a link regardless of
whether or not the document has been cached or has changed?
Netscape simply asks the HTTP server is the document has changed and
DOES NOT retransfer the document if it hasn't.  In the next release
Netscape will have a persistant disk cache that will dramatically
decrease the total bandwidth requirements.  So if anything, Netscape
helps you as a provider provide more information with lower bandwidth
requirements.

This header has been in the HTTP 1.0 spec since the beginning, and
other browsers have been sending this header without complaints.

BUT, pending the discussion we had in Chicago I have turned the
"From:" header off for future versions of Netscape.

PS- have you been in contact with the authors of Mail programs to make
sure they stop grabbing your email address off your system and sending
them with your email messages?

HEAD is part of the HTML 2.0 standard. In theory, it allows you to,
for example, quit looking for TITLE or LINKs as soon as you see the
end of the HEAD element. In practice, not enough users put <HEAD>
tags in their documents to make this optimization useful.

Hmmm... you're using a parser that implements OMITTTAG, like a
validating SGML parser, you can make use of this. The way this
works is that the parser knows that a </head> tag has to go before
any tags like <h1> or <p>.

Anyway... the long and the short of it is that in theory, if you
have an 80MB html file, you shouldn't have to scan the whole thing
for the title. In practice, HEAD isn't used for anything.

>also where can I get a relavant set of HTML specs and HTTP specs

For HTML, see:

	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec

For HTTP, what you've seen is probably the latest thing that's been
written. There's been some noise about an IETF working group for
HTTP, but I don't know anything for certain.

Well, at least you can :-} At least you don't have to pay for a license
just to read the source.

But you're right: this is a pitiful state of affairs. You're
certainly welcome to revise any of the standards drafts and clear
up these issues.

On the other hand, TimBL has actually gotten the W3 Consortium off the
ground (HaL got its invitation a couple weeks ago). Hopefully, it will
staff up soon and the standards documents will be maintained there.

You're on the right track. Browsing the web, reading the source code,
and posting to www-talk is pretty much the state of the art. Sad,
but true.

Folks are complaining about NetScape opening multiple sockets at once.
>From a UI perspective, you can't be faulted with trying to display the
most material in the fastest possible time.

The Miss Manners approach to network programming dictates, however, that 
a single application not go about hogging resources (like sockets, 
bandwidth, etc...) to accomplish this. 

Analogy time: Folks programming under Windows or Mac realized very 
quickly that hogging the event loop pisses off the users (and other
application vendors). Under Unix, the O/S acts as the dictator and parcels 
out cycles so this becomes a non-issue. The lesson: unless there's a
higher force at work, shared policies are self-enforcing.

In a TCP/IP based application, we're back to the cooperative model. 
There is NO central authority passing out network "cycles" so it is 
assumed that the various applications will behave in a "polite" manner 
and not hog resources.

Allocating multiple sockets and pumping the max out of them is offensive
to some because it violates this spirit of cooperation. If a client is
simultaneously using NetScape and WhizBang (a distributed application),
and WhizBang uses a single socket to talk to its server, it isn't difficult
to understand WhizBang developers being pissed off at MCC for making their
application look sluggish. In their next release, they too will go about
soaking up resources and screw over PopSqueak, the cool whiteboard
application who is still foolish enough to open a single socket.

Under PC's and Mac's, running multiple TCP-based applications is not
very efficient in any case (mainly due to the non-preemptiveness of the OS). 
Under Unix, VMS, OS/2, and NT though, the kernel does multitask, so it's 
conceivable the user is running multiple TCP-based apps both in the foreground
and the background. However, there is no bandwidth allocation mechanism
amongst the various systems on the net. TCP-induced artificial delays
and routers are about the only thing giving applications a chance.

Is there a solution? Basically, there are four ways to handle the situation.

1. First is to say everyone's on their own. Go wild. Hell why stop at 4 sockets.
Go for the whole shebang. And while you're at it, create extra processes
on the server to handle cache remote stuff in the background. Take all the
free disk space as well. 

2. The second way is for everyone to agree to certain polite rules of network 
behavior. This is honor-based however, and everyone agrees to stick to 
the rules. 

3. The third is to enforce rules unilaterally.  Servers WILL NOT accept 
multiple connections from the same process on the same host, etc... Even 
more Draconian would be to enforce this rule in the kernel. Going even 
further, auto-throttling schemes would be put into the various kernels to 
limit bandwidth hogging. 

4. The last way, is to let the users decide. Have them pick how many sockets 
they think they need. This is not too fair to the other users, but hey, 
who says life's fair (:-)

Personally, I think until there are kernels and protocol stacks that enforce
bandwidth and resource allocation, options 2 and 4 are the polite way to
go. My personal preference would be for NetScape to set the default
socket count to 1, but allow the user to bump it up to a civilized limit
(say 4) with a message box that pops up and says something like 
"Choosing more than 1 socket may speed up your access but will slow down 
other running network applications and other users accessing the server." 

So the choice is the user's. And if WhizBang slows to a crawl it's their
own fault. They probably shouldn't be trying to get work done while running
Mosa-I mean NetScape anyway...  Caveat usor (:-)

Cheers,
Ramin.

Free to whom? I don't know of anyone who doesn't have to pay (in some form
or another) to place information on the net. Yes, the content is more
important than the technology which delivers it (but see below). But, if
the information someone provides is really that valuable to others, there
are plenty of ways that server/network loading can be taken care of.

For example, several years ago one of the most popular ftp archives for Mac
software (sumex-aim.stanford.edu) was having a disk space crunch. The
archive maintainers gave notice that this was the case and some
enterprising soul suggested that everyone chip in a few bucks to buy some
more disk space. Someone else offered to handle credit card transactions,
and by the time the whole thing ended the sumex-aim administrators had
enough money to buy twice the disk space they originally thought they would
be able to afford.

I suggest that something similar can easily occur for Web sites which offer
valuable information.

This particular design decision appears to have been made with the goal of
improving the user's experience. If doing so puts a higher demand on the
net's resources, so be it; assuming that the goal of better user experince
is reached, the tradeoff is reasonable. It bothers me that so many people
seem to fret about what Netscape will do to their servers, but they don't
seem to care about what life is like for folks at the other end of the
pipe.

It also bothers me that so many people seem to have assumed that the
Netscape method of server interaction actually causes problems. Is everyone
privvy to stats I'm not aware of, or are people jumping to unsupported
conclusions? From a purely subjective and biased vantage, I haven't heard
of any concrete problems from the server *or* the client end. Can anyone
point me towards better information?

The concept of advertising as a multicast "push" activity has been questioned
by many. Most experiments seem to suggest that a unicast "pull" approach,
initiated by the user is both more valuable and potentially more useful
(the user is already, in sales-speak, "motivated"). However, this type of
advertising implies the availability of tools and resources to point a user
at the proper place for such material and the flexiblity to present the
information in the way a user is capable of receiving. Putting everything
onto WWW when the majority of users do not have the bandwidth to view
the color graphics is downright silly. Potential advertisers have to match
the message to the medium the same way they produce different material for
television broadcast, print media, direct mail, and point-of-sale.

As for broadly distributed information, publishing efforts should take
note of services like Newsbytes, where end-users are not directly
billed by the service. Access providers like this one (netcom) subscribe
to such a service and pass it on to the users as an "added" free service.
Of course, the basic monthly access fee to netcom is what is paying
for this, but the users do not have to make a choice as to whether they
get a service and pay for it. It's just there if they want it.

With the proliferation of internet access providers, such a model becomes
more attractive, because it encourages the access provider to offer new
services to make its product more attractive to the increasingly discerning
consumer. One other advantage for the access provider offering the service
to their client-base is that activities like authentication and billing are
already being done by the access provider in order to give the users access. 

Efforts like MecklerMedia and others like it are like direct mailing:
they try to directly connect to the end-user and only a small percentage 
of potential users will respond back. Direct mailers also have to be backed 
up by a lot of extra "infrastructure" like 800 numbers, customer service, 
etc... in order to work. All of this infrastructure, of course, is not
directly revenue producing either. Offering magazines that you can get 
for $3 in print form is also pretty silly. 

Instead, MecklerMedia could become an information provider subscribed to 
by the likes of netcom. In this approach, MecklerMedia is more like a 
production studio. It is responsible for production of the material. 
Netcom would be your local TV station. It would buy the material from 
MecklerMedia and offer it to its "viewers." Netcom would then reap the 
rewards of offering such unique and hopefully useful content to its 
subscribers. Other access providers (stations) are free to purchase 
Meckler's products as well, but if they don't they may potentially pay 
for it in lost customers. Meckler's role, other than producing the 
content, would be to advertise its benefits (in other media) 
to help generate interest.... etc... I would also make access providers 
like netcom would also carry the "global index" for Meckler's material. 
This would allow netcom's users to find information quickly. Meckler's
servers would then be accessed only to obtain information specifically
requested by an end-user.

P.S. I never though I would use the words consumer, point-of-sale, and
Internet in the same breath, but it sure seems to be heading that way, 
isn't it (:-)

Cheers,
R.

Has anyone been keeping track of what the economists have to say on this 
topic ? According to Hal Varian (U. Michigan) packet - or similar - 
use -based charges are more or less inevitable (though difficult to 
implement right now because of the router problem). There has also been 
discussion of this topic on list VPIEJ-L - primarily at the behest of 
Stephen Harnad.

If I can be permitted 2x my $0.02 worth...

1. We have had Mosaic running at this site on an experimental basis since 
May. Many academics - including myself - would be overjoyed to join the 
Mosaic "club" - but the blunt truth is that we don't have the capacity to 
handle the traffic that the widespread use of this browser is likely to 
generate; for similar reasons the provision of a www server at our site 
is out of the question. We are likely to upgrade our capacity within a 
year (or two) but the rise in connection charges is likely to be steep, 
and in any case improved Internet connectivity is going to take a back 
seat to LAN connectivity - as, in my view, it should - and to supplying 
computing resources to students.

2. I don't think that anyone should be under the illusion that improved 
technology will leave the network unchanged. Two developments are likely 
- increased pressure to upgrade will eventually drive limited resource  
providers off the net altogether or into niches (backwaters ?), and, via 
pressure on the capacity of the system, the increase in traffic will have 
the same effect - by hastening the packet 
charge scenario Robert Raisch mentions. Packet charges will have the same 
effect as any charges for previously "free - to-end- user" goods - 
consumption (and possibly packet charge levels) will gyrate around until 
some equilibrium is reached - an equilibrium, I suspect, which many 
individuals - and not a few institutions - will find unacceptable. Result ?
Welcome to MY world ... I happen to be an accountant.

I DO NOT find this latter scenario attractive, and my preference is for a 
low flat rate fee structure for non-commercial and academic use, a 
distinction between academic and commercial users and a "provider pays" fee 
system for the latter linked to user size. However, I doubt that this is 
realistic - the Net is too close to a free market in structure, and 
although the Net community may protest - even ostracise - innovations 
such as Netscape, the authoring company is no Cantor and Siegel. We shall 
have to get used to the fact that the Net is going to change in reponse 
to graphics - based browsers, and find some way of living with the 
consequences....

PS Just a thought - is there any way for a site to restrict access to 
browsers having attributes the site finds "unattractive" (my guess is 
"not right now").

My guess is that nobody has any deliverables hanging over their head
in this area. In other words, nobody has any immediate problems to get
solved. Necessity is the mother of invention, after all.

But I wouldn't say that nobody's interested in the issue of expanding
the web to effectively support non-western writing system. I have
gotten a number of inquiries on this subject from different
directions: folks on ISO committees, folks writing HTML books, folks
making strategic corporate decisions.

I don't have any good answers. I point them to the various archives
and wish them good luck. UTF-8 looks like a good idea, since it has
some of the right backwards-compatibility characteristics. There's a
version of Mosaic available that groks certain ISO2022 constructs.

I haven't had time to read either of the specs (Unicode/ISO646 or
ISO2022). (And givem my experience reading ISO document in the past,
I'm not looking forward to it.)

>From following the discussions on comp.text.sgml, and reading the IETF
drafts, the only thing that's clear to me is that language and
character set issues are a mess.

My advice: find specific, solvable, problems, and attack them. Don't
try to be everything to everybody. Have a body of information and and
audience in mind, and design and deploy an application. In other
words, we're in the research phase.

Well, the response to some proposals has been "but what about ancient
Martian, where the tense of verbs is communicated through the ion
radiation of the ink?" What I mean is that there are some writing
systems where the cost of implementation and deployment exceeds the
benefit to be gained. We must keep in mind that HTML and WWW are
essentially cheap technology. Otherwise, it gets too big to maintain,
and only commercial enterprises can support it, and their products
have short life cycles.

Hmmm... in general, it looks like the problem is that language and
character issues are expensive to solve, and nobody has found a cheap
solution that scales. HTML took off because the start-up costs were
low, but enough folks saw the value of hypertext functionlity so that
a large body of data accumulated, so that as time went by, the value
of "joining the web" increased. Obviously, critical mass was reached
and BOOM! Terabytes of HTML.

So if you find something relatively simple that will solve 80% of the
problems, for god sakes let us know! Write it up. Give examples.  Get
somebody to code it up.

One unfortunate side effect of the growth of the web is that there
are a lot more people to convince when you want to introduce a new
feature. But don't let that stop you!

As I understood it both sides were right. :-)

LANGUAGE markup was important and an orthogonal issue to
charset marks.

So you could write: (wrong syntax but you get the idea)
<LANGUAGE FRENCH> Sacr&eacute; bleu!</LANGUAGE>
is a french exclamation.

The character set is the same, but the languages are different.

Similarly, charset markup is important.  This was not
completely resolved as far as I remember.

<LANGUAGE FRENCH CHARSET="ISO-8859-1">Sacr&eacute;</LANGUAGE>

<LANGUAGE GREEK CHARSET="ISO-xxxx-y">Zevs</LANGUAGE>

where Zevs would be the bytes rendered in the appropriate
greek character set.  Knowing the semantic nugget: this is in Greek
is a bonus, but not required for character sets to be marked.

Not needed for the purpose stated above.  URC might do other things
but you don't need them to do basic format negotiation.

See http://www.bsdi.com/HTTP:TNG/MIME-ClientProfile.html for my (old)
proposed solution to that.  Also the HTTP spec has some of this stuff
in it as part of the Accept headers.

One way or another the user has to be able to indicate they want a specific
format.  Whether it be they just say they want PostScript or they tell
the client they want to print it (on their PostScript printer).  Either
way the user is making the choice.

I believe what he was saying (which makes sense to me, and I've submited
bug reports on it to both NCSA and Mosaic Comm. (should I send one to
Spry? :-)) is that the Accept header for inline images should be different
than the Accept header for regular references.  That takes care of the
case where you can't handle Targa images.  If you don't *want* to handle
them inline, then clearly it's up to the browser implementor to give the
user a way of specifying that seperately in the type->application prefs.

The problem with having an entirely new type is that you now put the
onus on the user to add that type to their list of accepted ones, or
else you put them in a situation where their browser will claim not
to be able to read certain documents which in fact it could read, just
not well.  HTML is upward compatible to some degree, and I shouldn't
be unable to read, say, a document that has a Table into it, at worst
I should get a warning (once please) that tells me there may be some
things that aren't supported.

Subject: Cloture on presentation vs. structure debate
content-length: 1390

Perhaps we should vote--the debate is going in circles, and the longer we talk
about it, the more bad solutions will arise--something needs to be _done_.  I
see several possible futures (not mutually exclusive) that have been brought up
in this discussion, and I'd like to know what people see as being the best one.
Does someone want to throw up a quick voting form?

1. HTML+++
	HTML is continually expanded to include more direct-presentation-control
	tags, some accepted by the HTML WG, some done ad hoc (ala MCOM).

2. HTML 3.1
	HTML as it has been, plus stylesheets to control presentation.

3. SGML
	WWW Browsers become SGML browsers, allowing providers to use the
	DTD best suited to their documents: PDL (presentation display lang)?,
	HTML, MDL (math display language)?, any other DTD, which can all be
	mixed in a single document.

4. Multi-format browser
	Mosaic, etc. become larger, able to read and display HTML, Web-PDF,
	Web-TeX, CGM, SVF, VRML, etc.

5. Chimera-style multi-format browser
	Single browser which uses separate rendering plug-in programs to
	interpret different formats

6. Multi-browser (CCI, CORBA)
	Several smaller browsers, one for each format, which can communicate
	with each other.

Can we refine our discussion a bit by speaking in the same terms, and arguing
the relative merits of each of these possibilities?

Subject: Some thorns for the presentation vs. structure debate
content-length: 1310

I'm not going to espouse any answers to the debate yet, but I'd thought I'd
throw in a couple wrenches.  As we discuss these things, remember the following:

1. Not everyone has a nice GUI for viewing your pretty documents.  Most academic
	and dial-up service users still (and for the near future) must use
	text-terminal-based browsers and viewers.  The solution cannot dump
	them just yet.

2. Font/Layout control is just one element of this debate.  The solution we
	come up with must be scaleable to handle other display extensions that
	will hit us in the _very_ near future:
	- Vector Graphics
	- Interactive, choreographed, Multimedia (a la CD-ROM stuff)
	- Virtual Reality

3. Most of the non-web document producers out there don't know or care about the
	structure of their documents, as much as some of us would like to deny
	it.  To implement any structure-based system, there will have to be
	some heavy education/evangelizing, and tools that make it _very_ simple
	to convert documents and glean structure from the sloppy documents that
	people make.  The benefits of structure-encoding must be made very
	clear.

One more thing.  This discussion should really be moved to www-html.  I
subscribe to both, but it's nice to have things in their proper places.

Should not the question be to what degree the creator has control? The
presentation fidelity issue is not black and white, there are shades of
gray. I believe that in the long run the winning approach will provide
the author enough control for a look and feel while allowing the reader
enough control to adopt the document to their tastes and environment.

Would this debate be more constructive if we discussed what control variables
there are and what level of control each party needs to have? Here is a
short list to start with:

 * Wide variety of fonts

 * Special characters

 * Lists and tables

 * Graphics
   - Flowing text around graphics
   - Captions on graphics

Could you clarify the first objection a bit?  The second one I find quite
reasonable.  Having to buy a new machine to view a document would be a bit
extreme.  But I have a hard time imagining that it would be a good thing to
try and make one browser, at least under the current architecture, try to
do everything.  Are you objecting only to the resulting inconsistent user
interface?  The memory footprint?  The loose integration?  (They're all
related, I imagine.)

One reason that the interface presented by Mosaic is consistent is that
it's so limited.  For example, we'd like to be able to open up at least
three windows (or panes) and maybe a navigational palette.  We'd like to
display sources, topics and search results.  Doing that in a way that's
consistent with others would be ideal, but right now, we can't do it at
all.  I don't want to sacrifice *good* UI for the sake of consistently
mediocre UI.

In Chicago, I made a joke about in-line PDF documents, which drew a hard
stare and "Why not?" from Dave Raggett.  I'm slow, but I figured out that
his basic point, which is that just about anything might be in-lined, is at
least worth considering.

But it brings us back to the same question that has been kicked around here
several times -- how do we distribute executables safely?  With Acrobat as
a helper application, we trust that when we ftp it from adobe.com, it's
safe.  It's a bit more fear-inducing when there are lots of people
distributing executables that would somehow be linked into a browser so
that features like in-line PDF would be possible.

In any event, today's situation is that we are coming from the helper
application model, which could lead us toward a future in which Web
browsing becomes a components of many applications, so the the browser you
get depends on the nature of the document you retrieve.  Some suggest that
Mosaic, for example, might become little more than a window manager.

Yes, but your browser knows prior to making the request whether or not it
intends to display the result inline or externally, and can generate
different Accept: headers appropriately.

(Conversely, if you use Accept-inline, how the heck is the server supposed
to know whether you're fetching the given object as an inline or an external
image?)

No, you don't need to send a bug report to Spry.  AIR Mosaic does indeed only
send Accept: headers for the inline image types (currently only image/gif and
image/xbm) that it knows how to handle.  :^)  However, this does NOT solve
the problem in the long run.  What happens when we move to a system that
requests the document _AND_ its components (e.g. inline images) via either an
MGET or a smart server with multipart MIME handling?  At that point, we are
requesting a generic "document", and if it is an HTML document we want to get
its inlined images in the same multipart message, and we need to specify
which types we can handle internally, but if the whole document is an image
of a type we don't handle internally, we need to have our Accept: headers set
up for all the image types we handle externally.

You've just kind of contradicted yourself - doing an "HTML/2.0+Mozilla"
scheme would also require the user deliberately specifying that their
browser can handle those extensions, so where's the win?  At any rate,
the only difference is whether you are trying to create a way for
browsers to specify to the server that they handle arbitrary
extensions to HTML.  I'd rather NOT create that process, because I
believe doing so would take the some of the pressure off the HTML
standardization process.  Hey, if somebody comes up with a cool new
feature, great, let's work it into HTML, if it can be agreed upon.  If
not, then it probably doesn't belong in HTML.  Realistically speaking,
we're not arguing about "experimental" tags here - I couldn't care
less if someone puts a document on their server and serves it up as
"text/html" with a few tags that they're trying out in their new
browser.  We're talking about the process by which HTML itself
changes.  I strongly believe that we MUST keep a strong core standard
in order for the WWW to not degenerate into chaos in terms of document
format standards, and facilitating an EASY method by which browser
authors can thumb their nose at the rest of the HTML design process
is not high on my list of priorities.  I understand the difficulties
at this point for many software authors - MCOM and SPRY included -
who want to add new features to the Web.  No problem, but let's
a) channel some of that driving force into driving the standards
(the faster the web grows, the better for SPRY, even if MCOM is
doing some of the driving :^), and b) mark newly-developed features
as experimental until they're ratified as "standard".

Could you give some evidence to support this? My test data (~100
test cases culled from around the net ... see

	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-test/README.html

along with hundereds of folks using the validation service and not
complaining) indicates that the current specification is consistent
with existing documents, practices, and implementations.

The P container/separator issue was debated at length in the HTML
Working group (which is open to all interested parties.) The list is
archived. There is even an edited collection of pointers on this
topic:

	"HTML 2.0 Spec Review Topics"
	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/notes/ReviewTopics.html

> and in my opionion is a very
>bad idea.

Your opinion, and any evidence to back it up, would have been welcome
on the html-wg mailing list back when this issue was being debated.

Spreading Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about the interoperability
aspects of the HTML 2.0 specification at this point is pretty much
inexcusable, given the openness of the working group and the
availability of the archives.

"We"... hmmm. Mosaic communications corp. was noticeably absent
from the discussions on html-wg. Despite this, I believe the
HTML 2.0 spec does coexist with existing practice.

Evidence to the contrary is welcome.

I think it was Roy Fielding, actually, and META is now standard in 2.0.
See:

http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/spyglass-19941014/HTMLSPEC_18.html

(but watch out! There are some typos in the examples.)

The relavent part of the DTD is:
<!ELEMENT META - O EMPTY    -- Generic Metainformation -->
<!ATTLIST META
        HTTP-EQUIV  NAME    #IMPLIED  -- HTTP response header name  --
        NAME        NAME    #IMPLIED  -- metainformation name       --
        CONTENT     CDATA   #REQUIRED -- associated information     --
        >

>2) Is it useful to standardize on some _minimum_ suggested tags 
>(conforming with IAFA or with the feds GILS project) such as author, etc.

We didn't come up with any. The NAME attribute of META is unconstrained
(beyond the syntax of an SGML name -- so, for example, it's not
case sensitive).

Agreed. That's why META is in there. We kicked around the idea
of a standard set of names, but we decided to let the market
decide instead.

Ah, I see the apparent "hole" in my argument.  I'm not saying that if I make
a request for "blah.gif", the server should know that I'm thinking that's an
inlined image.  I'm saying that in the case where I make the request for
"blah", and I don't know what type the document is, if it's an image, the
server should pay attention to the "Accept:" headers.  If it's an HTML
document, the server should look at the "Accept-inline:" headers to see if
it should send back the inlined images as well, via multipart MIME, etc.
I don't see any other way of telling the server "Send me back this document,
and if it has any component pieces, send them back too," while still
specifying which top-level types and which component (inline) types you
can handle.

Ah.  That's a problem.  Sounds like we're back to my original proposal

I was assuming that browsers would handle a whole new type (x-mozilla-html)

I'm not disagreeing with your comments... my own feeling, however, is
that in terms of the overhead imposed on servers, the number of
simultaneous requests is a smaller issue than the effective use (and
re-use) of transport connections.

Commenting in response to the folks who say that a server reaches
steady state whether the clients are single-connection or
parallal-connection: I agree with the note that with faster user
response, the user may read more pages over a given period of time.
This will increase the steady state load by some amount.  (My feeling
is that it would be less than 25% for a population of serious
browsers, and a higher percentage for a population of wild surfers)

Because one of the places this would be used would be in generating the
source HTML document, not retrieving the data.  I don't care if you can
inline PostScript or not, nor am I likely to do anything about it.  If
your browser said:
	Accept-Inline: jpeg, type=color
I could send you a reference to the BEST version of that object I had.

One would dynamically generate a differnt document based on what your
browser supports.  Infact I already do this for some of my documents,
based on some information I know about the 'User-Agent:' headers.

This is what I have been advocating for at least half a year. The

of any type whatsoever:

  - inline GIF in HTML (HTML viewer calls GIF viewer)
  - inline HTML in HTML (HTML viewer calls HTML viewer)
  - PostScript in HTML in HTML (HTML calls HTML, which calls PS)
  - inline PDF in whatever in somethingelse
  - etc.

(Note that MCCI, Mosaic's remote control, is not useful here.)

I didn't phrase it like that (i.e., "window manager"), but my W3A API
would indeed make the central browser into something like a window
manager. Except that from an ergonomics point of view I would like it
to manage as few windows as possible, just 1 preferrably.

However, for this to work conveniently, the PDF viewer should be
rewritten as an applet, using the standardized API. I don't really
want to intercept the viewer's X events, like a real window manager
does.

Of course, I don't want to write a PDF interpreter from scratch. So
the question is: will there be an W3A-compliant PDF applet, or if not,
a PDF library?

And if PDF is `unsafe' (PostScript is, but I don't know enough about
PDF), then we will want to have `safe-PDF-viewers' as well.


Bert


PS. For W3A see <http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A/W3A>

PPS. All browsers so far belong to what I call "the 1st
generation". Browsers with applets (W3A or something better) would be
the 2nd generation, and the 3rd generation would probably see
distributed browsers. Anybody willing to help develop this 2nd
generation?

Yes, and yes they are.

The original posting talked about a special communication between a particular 
PDF viewer and a particular Web browser - S-Mosaic. It has since transpired that 
the Spyglass mods will be merged back into the public Mosaic code base, but that 
does not alter the basic principle.

Suppose I am using some browser A.  In the HTML document I am reading (1), there 
is a link to a PDF. I select the link and up pops my PDF viewer. In this PDF 
document is a link to  HTML document 2. I select that, and up pops S-Mosaic to 
show document 2. So now I have two web browsers up, one for my normal use and 
one to show pages that happen to be referred to from PDF documents. This is 
clearly (I hope) undesirable, no?

I can either go with this two browsers (two separate hotlists, two separate 
history trails) approach, or more likely I would have to ditch browser A and use 
S-Mosaic as my main Web browser. I do not want to be forced into this situation.

My comment about platforms was induced by finding that there is no Motif PDF 
viewer for Unix/X platforms. Multi-platform does not just mean doing Macs as 
well as WinDoze PC's.

Inline EPS - a closely related concept, I am sure you will agree - has been 
feasible for years. In the days of Mosaic 1.1 I sent mail to Marc Andreessen 
suggesting that X Mosaic might well use the Display PostScript X extension 
supported by all major workstation manufacturers (bar HP ;-( ). I used to  
use a mail reader that detected PS files and displayed them in this manner.

> One reason that the interface presented by Mosaic is consistent is that
> it's so limited.

I hope you are not going to confuse the conceptual issue of a single user 
interface for all the hypertext internet communication tools with the specific 
features that Mosaic for X has right now?

As I recall from old slides that used to be at CERN, TimBL concieved of the Web 
on seeing scientists use 7 or so computer systems from several terminals, all 
with different commands and interfaces.

I recall having to use xgopher, xarchie, mxrn, etc etc to access the various 
internet services.

At the moment, a single browser can access a variety of servers (gopher, web, 
news, ftp, etc) all with a single consistent user interface and these documents 
can reference each other fairly freely. I can read an HTML document, select a 
link to a news group, browse the articles there and select a link from one of 
them to an FTP site or another HTML file, and mail the author. This is good.

I do not want the web to fragment such that I need my favourite browser plus the 
one that can talk to Acrobat plus the one that does inline CGM plus the one that 
handles sniff-o-matic URLs.

Yes, that is what I was alluding to. Not only do I not want to need two or more 
Web clients, I would prefer to have the document-like formats like PDF+Web, 
HyperTeX, etc all handled by my browser. I speak from a user interface point of 
view here. Whether the browser actually deals with a format or hands it off for 
rendering to a helper application - much the best idea, IF the rendered result 
is displayed by the browser - is irrelevant to me the user.

Your analogy of the browser being a windowe manager, or a shepherd for a flock 
of cooperating applets, is a good one.

The multiple TCP connections I'm seeing don't bother me nearly as much as the
bug in all versions of 0.9 with user authentication that causes an infinite

(the domain name has been changed to protect the innocent)

Over and over, as fast as the link will support.  I'm very close to 
disallowing all accesses from User-Agent =~ /Moz/, as our servers are
being totally hosed by this.  They did manage to fix problems with user 
authentication present in other browsers, but this is far more harmful.
In essence, it's a denial of service attack - one guy has been doing this
every second for over an hour.

Please, PLEASE, if you access our site, and you see a the words 
"Connecting to host" and "receiving data" blinking over and over, HIT THE 
STOP SIGN.

The only solution I know of right now is to sit watching the server, 
continually editing a .htaccess file on our root level to deny accesses 
from certain hosts.

Oh yeah, HotWired is up for business.  I'll forward a more formal press 
release here in a bit, when it's ready.

Overall, I am astonished by the current furor over the attempt to get
better-perceived user performance.  The Web has some design characteristics
which make good performance difficult.  Namely, all the connection opening.

Overlapping i/o requests is a time-honored approach to improving performance.

On the other hand...

My eperience living on the end of a 14.4 modem suggests that MAYBE two
simultaneous transfers work well, but I don't think so.  Certainly not
more.

The problem is that the congestion control mechanisms in TCP aren't
sufficiently sensitive to "coordinate" the consumption of such a small
pipe.

I have a hard time complaining that Web usability has gotten more efficient
as a result of Mozilla multi-threading.  Hell, if I wanted an information
system that was a pain for the users to use, I would've stuck with gopher :)

I am of the opinion that anyone wishing to claim that bursty traffic is
harder on the network as a whole would do extremely well to present some
amount of evidence, since such a claim tends to contradict conventional
wisdom in operating systems (queuing theory and the such).  If I'm not
mistaken, the average waiting time should not increase, which is typically
the measure by which to judge network performance.  This analysis of course
neglects Karl's observation that average usage may increase due to ability
to begin the next transaction before the current is finished.  I addressed
this concern in the above paragraph.

Alan, nobody is assuming that a useage charge would have to be constant 
in terms of microcents per packet, or whatever; phone companies are 
already quite adept at slicing up parts of a long-distance phone call. It 
would'nt be much of a stretch to introduce a pricing regime - for phone 
calls - which was time-related ( $2 for the first minute, 50c for the 
next four minutes - and progressively higher or lower after that, 
depending on what kind of user behaviour you want to produce). So far as 
pricing packets are concerned, what is to stop someone creating some 
software which monitors the number of packets passing a certain point in 
the network, identifying the source and pricing accordingly - in this case, 
low for large numbers of packets and high for a smaller amount ? Movies, 
after all contain so much data that they're relatively easy to distinguish 
from other items - very few of us are going to pass text over the Net in 
Brittanica-sized chunks. So far as I'm aware, the router problem is 
still the major technical barrier to packet pricing; screwed or not, I 
don't think you should underestimate the ingenuity of economists - or of 
the business community in general, when it comes to getting "buck for the 
bang".

Lynx is one.  It adds all sorts of white space where there shouldn't

Yes, let's talk about this "process by which HTML itself changes"
... and this applies to HTTP as well, I think.

Chris: none of this is aimed at you. I'm mostly just thinking out
loud. It seems that it's not enough to have this format negociation
stuff sketched out on info.cern.ch -- we have to hash out the details
periodically on this list.


A careful reading of the WWW design documents shows that it was
designed with evolving distributed systems experience in mind.
Multiple formats are allowed. HTTP has versions. ...

But the existing mechanisms for evolving the WWW architecture just
don't seem to get the job done. Or maybe it's not the mechanisms as
designed, but how they are deployed that breaks down.

The criteria that I would use to test a mechanism for evolving the
protocols and data format is:

	* Once a piece of software has been implemented correctly
	with respect to version N, it should interoperate correctly
	with other pieces of software which are implemented correctly
	with respect to versions >= N.

I think the prime example of breaking this rule was the introduction
of FORMs. WWW browsers that used to be up-to-spec were suddenly
rendered broken because they didn't do forms. Had html-with-forms been
introduced as a new content type, they would have continued working
merrily along, and servers could automatically send the plain text,
email-reply version of a form to clients that didn't Accept:
text/html-with-forms.

OK, water under the bridge. But let's try not to do it again!

Most of the Mozilla extensions to HTML don't break anything. But if
CENTER can really be safely ignored, then you can't rely on it causing
a paragraph break. In other words, you shouldn't write:

	<h1>heading</h1>

	Some stuff.

	<center>Some centered stuff</center>.

because on browsers that only support HTML 2.0, the two paragraphs
will be blurred together as one. You should to write:

	<h1>heading</h1>

	Some stuff.

	<center><p>Some centered stuff</center>.


Tables are more like forms. The NCSA 2.5 browser should explicitly
Accept: text/html-ncsa-2.5 or some such, and there should be an easy
way for information providers to communicate to their server software
the fact that a given document has tables in it, like using a .thtml
extension. Granted, .thtml is a short-term hack that doesn't scale,
but it's better than breaking existing clients.

Eventually, server software should be enhanced to efficiently open the
file and find some magic cookie (like a <!DOCTYPE declaration...)  in
the first few hundred bytes before deciding on the content type.  Or
some other efficient, but easy-to-maintain format negociation
mechanism should be deployed. I don't have enough experience to design
an optimal solution right now, but that's no excuse for folks to go
breaking existing clients. (I'll say it again: don't break existing
clients!)

Now let's look at the HTTP version mechanism. It seems explicit enough
that it should provide interoperability across versions. But let's
look at real scenarios:

Suppose HTTP 2.0 includes the ability to conduct multiple transactions
over the same connection.

So an HTTP 2.0 client connects to server.host:80 and writes:

	GET / HTTP/2.0
	Accept: text/html, text/plain

	GET /foo.html HTTP/2.0

Now it happens that server.host is running an HTTP 1.0 server.
On seeing HTTP/2.0 in the request, Should it:

	* error out immediately
	* attempt to service the first request, responding with
		HTTP/1.0 0200 ca va bien
		Content-Type: text/html

		<title>...

	  and close the connection

And how do currently deployed servers respond in this case?
My guess is that a lot of them don't even look at the HTTP
version. A quick test agrees with this:

connolly@ulua ../logs[566] telnet www.hal.com 80
Trying 148.57.2.14 ...
Connected to hal-alt-backbone.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/2.0
Accept: text/html

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Thursday, 27-Oct-94 20:35:46 GMT
Server: NCSA/1.3
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html
Last-modified: Tuesday, 30-Aug-94 07:22:28 GMT
Content-length: 1161

<title>HaL WWW External Tree</title>


OK... this is good enough. Our hypothetical 2.0 client can see the 1.0
response and assume that all requests after the first were ignored.


So it seems there's a couple heuristics that everybody should know:

	In an HTTP 1.0 server, and request with a version > 1.0 should
	be treated as a 1.0 request, rather than causing an error.
	(The request may cause an error for other reasons than the
	version number, of course.)

	Any HTTP requests for versions >= 1.0 must function syntactically
	as HTTP 1.0 requests, since when a client sends a request,
	it can't tell what version of the protocol the server implements.


By the way... does the idea of the server gratuitously packing up
inline images with html files into a mime multipart/mixed body really
look like a good idea to anybody? What about client-side image
caching?  What about per-image errors?

Doesn't it make more sense to just allow multiple transactions over
the same connection? For example:

	C: GET /foo.html HTTP/2.0
	   Accept: text/html, text/plain
	S: HTTP/2.0 0200 it is my pleasure to server you this document...
	   Content-Type: text/html
	   Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet

	   43
	   <title>foo</title><img src="images/bar.gif">
	   -1
	   HTTP/2.0 0206 what next?
	C: GET /images/bar.gif HTTP/2.0
	   Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbm
	S: HTTP/2.0 0200 a picture is worth a thousand words...
	   Content-Type: image/gif
	   Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet

	   4006
	   ... 4006 bytes of image data ...
	   -1
	   HTTP/2.0 0306 15 Other folks are waiting Come back in 15 seconds.
	S: <closes connection>

* This example looks half-duplex, but the protocol should be full
dupliex, e.g. the client can begin sending requests for inline images
etc. before the server has finished sending the original html
file. The client might send 15 requests, and the server might serve 10
of them and then close the connection.

* Henrik once suggested that we shouldn't rely on the requests and
responses staying in order -- a multi-threaded server might finish
requests in a strange order. This motivates transaction ids of some
sort. Perhaps:


	C: GET /foo.html HTTP/2.0 1
	C: GET /bar.html HTTP/2.0 2
	...
	S: HTTP/2.0 0200 2 here's the response to request 2
	S: HTTP/2.0 0200 1 here's the response to request 1


Anyway... just rambling, mostly, I guess.

Whatever scheme people use better support having different Accept: headers
(and other headers as well) associated with different parts of the request
or else they will have broken the entire system.  This goes far beyond
just inline images.

I wasn't trying to imply anything different.  It is, however, worth
noting that the Web as a whole is under exponential growth.  A single
step-up of 25% is almost immaterial with respect to a load that is 
doubling at the rate that we are seeing...

In general,
Servers are going to need to be better designed and the persistant
TCP bugs in kernels are going to need to be fixed.  We have already
taken steps on the first part and are working with system providers
on the second.  We've also taken steps towards a reducing a large part
of the bandwidth requirements by using persistant caching for the
future releases of our client (Netscape).  This should enable servers
to handle *drastically* larger loads.  I would hope that these factors
would reduce the accusations of "maliciousness" that other people
have suggested with regards to the client.  It is obviously in our
best interests to allow as many people to be served through our clients
and servers.  Any action which lowered this number would be crazy on 
our part.

I agree.  Specifically from the perspective of large internal corporate nets
relying on Web technology, diverging "improvements" gives a very different
set of +/- then people thinking of external nets.  Internally there's
potentially much more need for a standard set of markup, since there's also
more emphasis on global support.  It would be nice to run well tamed
(if we can believe there's such a beast) robots that can catch problems and
suggest solutions within a (seemingly) limited set of pages, while giving
users the flexibility to do what they want/need within the constraints
of the language.   It also provides some support capability from the
perspective
of understanding particular problems and limitations of browsers when
questions come up.

Thanks, I have now obtained the Unicode spec and a set of fonts. If I
get a chance I will have a play. The security stuff is talking my time
at present.

I think that Unicode is the only rational solution to the problem of 
writing HTML that works with large character sets (eg maths). It is
just silly to try inventing entity names for all the character codes
needed and expect all the browsers to understand them. Much easier to
state something like &#xx; refers to the base charset of the document
and &#xxxx; refers to the unicode 16 bit character set.


We can then deal with the Han unification controversy in either of
two ways, use a 32 bit encoding and add in extra planes or use the
language attribute to select the specific character set.


On thing I really want to do is to find somewhere to put my 
Egyptian hieroglyphs. Would people get all steamed up if a sneaked
a mapping of the Gardner taxonomy into some of the private planes?

Not acceptable. HTML is an abstract presentation language. Its development is 
formally within the IETF standards process. This is an open process which began
quite a long time ago and has debated these issues at length. Preempting the
process cannot be allowed to set a precedent.

This is the route that was agreed upon by the participants. I don't thnik that
anyone voiced significant objections.

HTML 3.0 has maths.

The SGML issue is a red herring. SGML only defines a structure, not a
presentation. For that try <? Process Directives>.

It would start to get unmanageable eventually. But this is the way that
most see the Web developing.

Plug in dynamic link routines is a more appropriate solution.

This is an implementation issue that I don't see as a proper subject
for a vote. If someone wants to do this then they can go ahead with or
without a vote. It is simply one of several valid technical solutions. 

I would be very interested in seeing such a browser.

Making <P> a container instead of a separator 
breaks very few existing documents.  (It may 
break old implementations, but so will anything
new.  Adding <IMG>, <FORM>, and <CENTER> "broke"
old implementations in the same way.)

Text outside of paragraphs is still legal, it's just 
not recommended.  <P> as a container *makes more sense* 
and will prove to be more useful in the long run.

An obvious way of distinguishing among the DTDs to which particlar
documents conform is to use the FPI (Formal Public Identifier) of
the DTD in question in the document type declaration of the document
served, and also somewhere in the MIME info.  The question is where?
If the MIME type is SGML, how should the FPI be specified?  If
the MIME type is HTML, how should it be specified via an FPI that
the HTML 2.0 spec is intended?

Things have been moving fast lately, and this issue is not handled
correctly at the moment. We intend, of course, to behave properly and
tell the world what we are serving, but it's not clear how this is
best done -- especially when targets are moving. But right now we need
some time to get the head above water.

I haven't seen any major problems.  It does screw up
    <li><p>foo</p>
but that was a desperate attempt on my part to get some formating
right for a bullet list.  There doesn't seem to be a clean way
to handle multiple paragraphs in a bullet list and get things

Having it is a first stpe toward SGML handling in browsers.

I think you've missed a lot. SGML+STYLESHEETS will give most
information suppliers enough control over the format of thier data.
HTML 3.1 is just a special case of this. <? PI> should not be used for
formatting hints, and indeed, they would soon become unmanageable.

The benefits of using stylesheets is that one can design an SGML DTD,
and a stylesheet to go with it, and then all SGML documents
conformaing to that DTD can be kdisplayed with the same  stylesheet
with good effects. This works. It is not hypothesis. The question is:
can we get it into the WWW?

Which means that the user must be able to control all presentation
parameters if necessary. However, in most cases one would choose to
render the document using the author's hints. Also, the tools used to
control presentation should be the same one both sides: we're all both
readers and authors, right?

I've started working on a page with references to ideas on HTML style
sheets. See http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Style/

I think this is the least interesting part for now. First we need to
reach consensus on the power struggle issue. Finding a lean, mean &
clean syntax is also important. The list of possible parameters will
in any case grow as new output media are hooked into the web.

Does this mean that Arena should accept: text/html-ncsa-2.5 too, 
becuase it also does tables? What sholds mosaic for mac send, i believe 
it does them too, probably it is not at version 2.5 either.

What happens when mosaic 2.6 comes out?

Very soon, this would mean that serv ers would have to look out for a 
large list of different accept headers, all of which would mean that 
HTML 3 style tables were accepted. This is just another way of keeping 
a browser list. Server writers and operators should not have to 
maintain an up-to-date list of all the browsers in existence and all 
the different versions therof and a table mapping each of these to what 
features of HTML 3 are supported.

Dan, the more I think about this the more it seems a poorly worked out 
solution. I know you used it mainly as a lead-in to your HTTP/2.0 
discussion, but still...

As HTML 3 is destined to be deployed and tested in stages, surely there 
must be some way to specify in a browser independent way what is 
accepted?

Sure, if someone wants to serve radically different experimental 
extensions to HTML these might be tagged as an entirely different 
format. 

But it seems absurd to penalise browsers that are helping us along the 
standards track from HTML 2 to HTML 3 by supporting some of the HTML 3 
features. 

> Eventually, server software should be enhanced to efficiently open

OK, I have been changing things on the servers I run so that all my  
HTML documents (even those served up by CGI scripts!!) begin thus, 
cribbed off the HaL syntax checker ;-)

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
<html><head> etc

First, is this correct? Should there be a 2 or 2.0 in there at the end 
and if so, does it go like this

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN//2.0">

Second, if this is correct, PLEASE someone spell out the magic words 
that should be placed at the top of HTML 3 documents.  

None of the ones at CERN have any declaration, they just start off 
<title> which is fine if you know what DTD you are using and it lets 
you omit tags.

Thirdly, if I create some HTML 3 documents and put them on my server, 
which I intend to do, if I get my server to spit out

Content-type: text/html; version=3.0

will this break anything? Will it offend anyone? Will it help anyone?

OK, the HTML 3.0 samples at cern (w3.org) are breaking existing 
clients, by your definition. They are tagged as text/html and have no 
DOCTYPE in them. What should be done about it?

	As an information provider I fully realize how desirable it is

	A small black font on a grey background is hard for me to read.

	I've sent a note about this to MCC, some time ago. No response.

Yes.

I would argue strongly for something very simple here even at the expense
of an extra transaction. 

 	C: GET /foo.html HTTP/2.0
 	   Accept: text/html, text/plain
 	S: HTTP/2.0 200 it is my pleasure to serve you this document...
 	   Content-Type: text/html

 	S: sends file <closes connection>


So far its identical to 1.0.

 	C: MGET /images/bar1.gif /images/bar2.gif /images/bar3.gif  HTTP/2.0
 	   Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbm
 	S: HTTP/2.0 0200 a picture is worth a thousand words...
	   URI: /images/bar1.gif
 	   Content-Type: image/gif
 	   Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet
 
 	   4006
 	   ... 4006 bytes of image data ...
 	   -1
	   HTTP/2.0 0200 a picture is worth a thousand words...
	   URI: /images/bar2.gif
 	   Content-Type: image/gif
 	   Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet
 
 	   5541
 	   ... 5541 bytes of image data ...
 	   -1
 	   HTTP/2.0 0200 a picture is worth a thousand words...
	   URI: /images/bar3.gif
 	   Content-Type: image/gif
 	   Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet
 
 	   4306
 	   ... 4306 bytes of image data ...
 	   -1
 	S: <closes connection>


This seems to me to have a number of advantages:

1) Simplicity.  Simple to implement for clients and servers.

2) Preserves statelessness of the server (VERY IMPORTANT).

3) After first transaction the client can decide which inline images it
   needs/wants and request only them.  Thus it works for clients which
   don't want images or have them cached.

4) Works fine with a 1.0 client and 2.0 server.  The initial request 
   from client is a 1.0 request and subsequently the three images would 
   be requested in three 1.0 transactions.

5) Works with a 2.0 client and 1.0 server.  The initial 2.0 request is
   treated by the server as a 1.0 request.  The client gets the response
   and sees the server is only 1.0 so it gets the three images in three
   1.0 requests.

The only drawback that I see is two transactions are required to get
the html document and all the inline images.  This seems a small price
to pay.  In fact, I cannot see a clean way to do this in one
transaction.

Abosultely, I have found it on occasion. Why not keep everyone happy:
if the user doesn't actively specify it, don't send it. If they do fill it
in in a preferences box, do send it.

        I like this.   I'm not entirely happy with aggregate's use of a
"dot on a line by itself",  but there is certainly precedent for that.
But  CTE packet  could work.

        I attacked the very same problem with the SIFT/UFT protocol.
This is a protocol for sending files,  kind-of a combination of LPR/LPD,
SMTP, and FTP.   (there are reasons why I wanted to invent another wheel)
I don't remember if RFC 1440 was up to this level or not.   SIFT has
changed for the better since they put out 1440.   It goes something like

.... other session verbs/commands, like "NAME", "USER", "TYPE" ...
DATA 4000
....4000 bytes of stuff...
DATA 1745
....1745 bytes of stuff...
EOF
.... other verbs/commands, ending with "QUIT" ...
.... (you could have an "ABORT" if there's trouble) ...

        The problem is that you have to "switch modes" from CR/LF lines
to byte counting.   This is quite significant if your O/S isn't byte
oriented.   I did the original work on VM (CMS) which is heavily record
oriented.   All that mode switching is why you've heard me whining about
Content-Length  -vs-  something like a line count,  though I don't really
see any other way to do it over TCP unless you want the overhead and risk
of "boundary" pattern matching.

        So ... you get my vote,  Dan.

Hi all,

        I was working on the CMS server and hadn't yet "prettied" the
Content-Type headers and it seemed that some clients failed to recognize
the content type of objects being returned.   Is this possible?

Heh. Actually, everyone is doing something wrong, and it's all my
fault. When I added user public information directories to NCSA httpd,
I used /~ as the magic prefix. But ~ is a character which, according
to the URL spec, is not supposed to appear in URLs unless % escaped. I
didn't realize this until either Dan or Marc V. pointed it out to me
some weeks later.

This will break almost all existing clients.  Most of them are not smart
enough to parse content-types according to MIME rules but will simply
determine that "text/html; version=2.0" is not a recognized content-type
and prompt the user to save the result in a file.

Of those clients I have handy, Mosaic 2.5b for X, Netscape 0.9b for X, and
Lynx 2.3b all do this.  Only Arena 0.91b does the right thing.

If you want to test this, a simple file with that content-type is 
available at <http://www.cs.indiana.edu/test.params>.

It's a pity, because it's obviously the right way to provide versioning
information but existing software won't work with it.

I think it was me, I'm pedantic like that. :-) Actually the spec has
varied a bit over time, but both RFC 1630 describing WWW URLs and the
latest standards-track URL definition from the URI WG declare that the
tilde may not appear in URLs unencoded.  As far as "parts of
specifications for WWW stuff that lots of people ignore in an
indignant fashion" it's far from the worst offender, of course.  I
think NCSA's httpd will work with the proper %7E encoding anyway, so I
wouldn't exactly blame Rob for it.  I suppose the documentation could
mention it.

What I really don't understand is the reaction some people have to
this; it's often something like "That's stupid and annoying" or "Who
made the people who write the spec god?" or "He just wants attention"
rather than rational reactions like "Hmmm... why is that?"

Well, fine, servers serve HTML 2.0 docs as "text/html" and 
HTML 3.0 docs as "text/html; version=3.0".  Browsers that implement all 
or part of HTML 3.0 should send an Accept field of "text.html; 
version=3.0", so servers can optionally be intelligent about what
versions of documents they serve.  The only missing link I see is how 
document authors tell servers their documents are HTML 3.0 - most servers 
base this on file extension (i.e., .html files are "text/html") so I 
don't see an easy way around defining a common file extension like .htm3 
or something.

Subject: An MGET proposal for HTTP
To: www-talk@www0.cern.ch
Date: Sun, 30 Oct 1994 21:21:43 -0600 (CST)
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL23]
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
content-length: 4553


Proposal for an HTTP MGET Method
 
   A much discussed pressing need for HTTP is a mechanism for the client
   to request and the server to deliver multiple files in a single
   transaction. The primary (but not sole) motivation is the need to
   improve efficiency of downloading an HTML file and multiple inline
   images for that file. Here is a concrete proposal for the addition of
   an MGET method to HTTP to meet this need.  An HTML version of this
   proposal is available at <http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/mget.html>
   
   _Design Objectives_

    1. The number of transactions to download an HTML file with inline
       images should be minimized.
    2. The client should have the option of downloading all, some or none
       of the inline images. It should be able to request some or all
       files with an "If-Modified-Since:" header.
    3. Additions to the protocol should be simple to implement for
       servers and browsers.
    4. The statelessness of the server should be preserved.
    5. New client / old server and old client / new server transactions
       should work.
    6. The server must be able to transmit the multiple files "on the
       fly" without knowing their size in advance and without making a
       copy of the whole package before transmission.
    7. The server must have the option of returning some of the requested
       files while denying access or reporting an error for others. In
       particular, it must return a separate status header for each
       requested file.
   
   
   In order to achieve the second objective above a minimum of two
   transactions will be required. In the first transaction the client
   receives the base HTML document (this is a GET transaction and should
   be identical to HTTP/1.0). The client is then in a position to decide
   which inline images to request. It may want all, some, or none, as it
   may have some cached or it may be incapable of displaying images.
   
   The second transaction is an MGET transaction. The client lists the
   URIs it wants each followed by an "Accepts:" header applicable to that
   URI alone. The client can also provide an "If-Modified-Since:" header
   for any of the requested files which should work like it does in
   HTTP/1.0 The server returns the files with a packet transfer-content
   encoding beginning each packet with the exact number (in ASCII) of
   bytes in that packet and an empty packet (size -1) to indicate end of
   file. Here is an example of a client server exchange.
   


        C: GET /foo.html HTTP/2.0<CRLF>
           Accept: text/html, text/plain<CRLF>
        S: HTTP/2.0 200 Success<CRLF>

Well, filename extension mappings are mostly a local problem.  There
do need to be some additional suggestions.

One needed change is that the HTTP spec needs to at least hint at what
a server should do if a document is requested but the server cannot
deliver it in any of the Accept:ed formats.  Return the document as
application/octet-stream?  Return an error?  Which one?

In any case, this also has problems with existing systems.  Servers
could, in principle, assume that accepting "text/html" with no further
qualifiers means support for up to version 2.0, but handling "*/*" and
"*" (what the latter means is beyond me, but NetScape seems to
generate it) is much harder.

I don't think we're willing to declare that "When the client says it
will accept anything, it doesn't really mean *anything*" and require
every server implementation have complete historical knowledge of
client history.  This is going to make it mighty difficult for servers
to allow the same document to be available in HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.0 in
a transparent fashion.

Chimera uses the MD5 signature of the URL truncated at 14 characters
as the cache filename.  Someone else gave me the idea and at the
time I was worried about weird characters ending up in
filenames so it seemed like a good idea.

Using MD5 may sound like overkill but it was really simple to do and I
have yet to see a cache name collision (as far as I know) and noone has
complained.  It seems fast enough.  I also figured that MD5 will end
up in the code anyways to be used for one of the authentication schemes.

Chimera limits the size of the cache (default 4MB).  It removes
the least recently accessed cache files when space is needed and if a
cache file is old (over 4 hours...a number I pulled out of thin air)
then chimera will retrieve the document from the source.  This is
bogus but it is good enough.  I read someplace that someone was using:

life_time_of_the_document = current_time - last_change_time

This seems like a good idea.  How is it handled by emacs-w3 and Arena?

Chimera also puts MIME fields at the top of the cache file to provide
information about the contents.

Generally, I think the proposal looks reasonably good (but what do I
know?)  I don't like the MGET paradigm, though; it's not general
enough.  As long as you're allowing multiple requests to be bundled
together, why not allow some/all of those requests to be HEAD or POST
or other HTTP methods?  Certain web robots could certainly benefit
from a cheap way to do a large number of HEAD requests together, for
example.

>           -1<CRLF>
>           <CRLF>

I'm not particularly fond of the "packet" CTE, but if others think
it's the best way to do things it should work.

These involve some potential problems.  It appears that the intention
is that a response without a content-type would default to "empty
body"; this could be done but represents a significant departure from
the current assumption, which is that no content-type defaults to
either text/html or text/plain.  I think this needs something a little
more explicit by way of specifying the boundaries between multiple
responses in some cases.

Also, I assume the intention of the URI header is to allow the client
to figure out which responses go with which clients?  I don't think
URI is a general enough way to do this; it's not difficult to imagine
circumstances in which the same URI (actually the same pathname for
that HTTP server) is requested in a bundled request but with other
parameters (e.g. different Accept: headers, a different HTTP method,
or the like.)

I'm not sure what a more general approach should look like.  What
comes to mind offhand is that the client should include an identifier
(say, a "Message-ID:" header) in its requests, and the server should
include the same identifier (say, in an "In-Reply-To:" header) in the
corresponding response.

 If one of my CGI scripts receive this header line, it send a document
without inline image (no "image/gif", ... in the Accept fields) and you
don't need to have a MGET :-)

 It's a good idea to cache document, but warning some documents are
protected : don't store these documents in the cache with a mode "644"

 Also, I like give an "username/password" when I access a protected
document for the first time, even if the document is in the cache.

There is one more objective I can think of. The client should be able
to look at the first bytes of inline images. Enough to determine the
size of the image and, if possible, enough to determine the colour map
of the inline image.

A feature like this would probably complicate all suggested simple
protocol suggestions, so,... would it be worth it?

Something else that might be of interest that I just noticed - if
you have a CGI script to handle POST's that outputs an Expires:
header then the data gets POSTed many many times - once each time the
user re-visits the CGI results page using BACK or FORWARD!

I was wondering why I kept getting four or five submissions all identical -
I bet the Shopping Networks would be happy :-)  I've just mailed them, lets
hope they fix it for 1.0

Another reason to ban /^Mozil/ (I've had the same problem with looping
authentication too)

I saw your comments about chimera (Brian B. sent them to me)...chimera
1.61 and above no longer caches documents that require authentication.

This was not the smartest thing to do but it is safer and easy.

Hi

I remind people that the www-talk list is for general WWW questions and
not for bug reports or user questions on specific applications. This
has nothing to do with mozilla as an application - but we want this
mailing lits to be of general interest with a low noise level.

If you are in doubt what mailing list to use, we provide a page of the
current mailing lists in use at

   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Administration/Mailing/Overview.html

In an ideal world, yes, getting a Web browser would effectively mean getting an 
O/S extension so all your applications can now read HTML and follow the links, 
etc. Adding PDF capability would be a similar process. I'm not sure it was even 
that simple on the NeXT, which I believe came closest.

I absolutely agree; I've tried to suggest that handling MIME stuff to
a reasonable degree is important in browsers, and been trying to make
mailcaps more friendly to the needs of WWW browsers.  Most current
browsers understand mailcaps at a very crude level; for instance, they
don't understand the "test" clause (Netscape and Lynx do; Mosaic
doesn't.  Haven't tried Arena.)

Unfortunately, it's a little late; virtually every existing browser
will barf on parameters in content-types, and even if these errors are
fixed tomorrow (which I've seen little sign they will be, I pointed
out this problem a couple times months ago and have seen no progress
towards fixing it) it'll be a problem for years.

Clearly we need some way to indicate parameter constraints with
Accept: headers; something like "Accept: text/html; version=3.1" or
the like.  Tolerant servers could not include version parameters on
clients that don't indicate them in Accept: headers.  Not a good
solution, but I don't know a better one.

Why?

Given that HTTP is 8 bit clean, the only reason I can think of is people 
passing URLs around in mail, through something awfull like an ASCII-EBCDIC 
gateway. Is that it?

On a similar line, would it be too much to ask to have browser writers for
non-UNIX platforms agree on a location for mailcap file for their
respective machines?  At the moment, excellent browsers such as MacWeb
keep their MIME mappings to themselves which means that you have to
replicate the MIME typing information that you use for every new
application that wishes to use MIME types.  It would be nice if you could
just have a single file to specify the mappings for all browsers, mailers,
etc as on UNIX platforms.  Of course, these application should still
provide the user with nice interfaces for editing the MIME information.

Just a thought,

Jon

> Proposal for an HTTP MGET Method

I was interested to see this proposal and pleased with the list of design 
objectives. In particular I was pleased to see the requirement for separate 
status headers for each requested component.

I would be happier if your proposal explicitly addressed the situation where 
one or more cacheing proxy servers have the requested files. In particular

1) What the proxy does to an incoming MGET, with an example MGET request and 
the resulting MGET the proxy sends out to the server

2) Both responses, from the server and the proxy. Assume the proxy fulfills 
more than one inline image request and is able to handle HTTP 2.0

3) How your proposal affects format negotiation. Suppose the proxy has 
bar2.tif which it got from the server at date d time t, and suppose the 
original server, if asked, would say that bar2.tif has not changed since 
then, and then suppose the client included bar2.gif in the MGET which passed 
through the proxy.

4) What happens with 2.0 client, 1.0 proxy, 2.0 server. I assume that the 
proxy forwards the entire request without looking at it because the method 
is unknown. The situation with a 2.0 client, 2.0 proxy and 1.0 server should 
also be described.

As I remember, these were the main thorny issues that came up last time this 
topic was discussed.

I think there has been an uncertainty all along about whether Accept lines 
should change between requests. 

If you take the view that they don't, then the optimisation that Guy speaks 
of is reasonable. Although what his scripts do with, say 

text/html, text/plain, image/*
or
text/html, text/plain, */*

would be interesting to discover. On the other hand, does that mean that a 
client that sends

GET document.whatever HTTP/version
Accept: text/html, text/plain, image/gif

is going to be happy getting a rasterised image of the page as a GIF? 

If you take the alternative view that accept lines refer to the current 
request, then Guy's optimisation is incorrect. It does however allow the 
client, or possibly the user of that client, to specify what format they 
would like a particular file delivered in (not just inline images, other 
files too).

The problem is that format negotiation has not been widely deployed, so 
whatever rubbish clients sent in their Accept headers made no material 
difference.

I am just finishing writing a book on how to run a web site, which
covers creating material for dissemination via the Web and setting up
and running a web server.  It describes HTML in detail and includes a
tear-out HTML reference card and a resource guide.

The book is entitled "Spinning the Web: How to Provide Information on
the Internet" and will be published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York

I think that before we can do anything serious about stylesheets, we
might first be better to study what we need them to be able to do. 

I am not aware of a document outlining the requirements, so, I'd like
to ask all the publishers, graphics designers, users, and browser
implementors to send me a list of things they'd like stylesheets to be
able to accomplish. In particular, I'd be very interested to hear
comments about layout requirements (fonts, colors, and such things are
fairly obvious). I will go through the mail I receive, and create a
list of requirements, which I will then send to the list for
discussion. 

If anyone has already started doing such work, please let me know!

   This will break almost all existing clients.  Most of them are not
   smart enough to parse content-types according to MIME rules but
   will simply determine that "text/html; version=2.0" is not a
   recognized content-type and prompt the user to save the result in a
   file....It's a pity, because it's obviously the right way to
   provide versioning information but existing software won't work
   with it.

Marc is right.  The Dienst technical report server uses (tries to use)
such parameterized Mime types, but we've decided to stop because, as
Marc observes, almost ALL clients are broken thus our users kept
complaining.  Dienst was sending a valid Mime type but the clients
could not handle it.

Not complaining, just confirming.

 Actually this script check only "image/gif" and send a clickable map
(ISMAP). It don't check "*/*" (or "*") because all browsers (I think) send
this Accept type and I don't want send a GIF image to see the magic word
"<IMAGE>" and can't use it.

There will be in January. Prentice-Hall is publishing my
book. Title will either be "Authoring HTML for Fun

It includes forms, clickable images, server includes,
indexing, linking and basic formating. It will have
a CD-ROM with examples and tools on it.

  MV> Actually the spec has varied a bit over time, but both RFC 1630

  CL> Why?

You're correct; the reasons for the placement of tilde on the 'unsafe' list
is ostensibly to allow safe passage through gateways.  I've asked a couple
of times on this list for specific instances of situations where tilde will
get corrupted, but have never received a reply.  I'm taking that to mean
that the situation is extremely rare, if indeed not even known.  As a
result, I'm continuing to use tilde, even though it violates the
specification.

In any case, the appropriate section from the URL draft (version 8) is:

   Characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons.  The space
   character is unsafe because significant spaces may disappear and
   insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are transcribed or
   typeset or subjected to the treatment of word-processing programs.
   The characters "<" and ">" are unsafe because they are used as the
   delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote mark (""") is used
   to delimit URLs in some systems.  The character "#" is unsafe and
   should always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and
   in other systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier
   that might follow it.  The character "%" is unsafe because it is
   used for encodings of other characters.  Other characters are
   unsafe because gateways and other transport agents are known to
   sometimes modify such characters. These characters are "{", "}",
   "|", "\", "^", "~", "[", "]", and "`".

I would like to add my thanks to John Franks for setting forth an MGET
proposal.  Straw proposals are much easier to debate than are the
hypotheticals that have been hand-waved at here.  I agree with his
objectives (not repeated here).  However, like some other writers, I
have some quibbles with/questions about the proposal.

john@math.nwu.edu (John Franks) writes:
  > Proposal for an HTTP MGET Method
[Design Objectives omitted]

1) Consider authentication.  Suppose the server requires authentication
for one or more of the URL's in the MGET.  What would the
interaction(s) between client and server look like?  Consider,
particularly, what happens if some of the elements of the MGET fall
into different protection realms and thus require different methods of
authentication (or different username/passwords, to keep the discussion
simple).

2) I would like to see a definition of Content-type-encoding: packet.
Specifically, which bytes are included in the byte count?  CRLF's?  Is
the data uuencoded?  Or are the bytes assumed to be binary data?  I'm
asking for clarity because, if clients and servers get out of sync with
the counts on the MGET response, the result at the client side will be
a real mess.

Actually we have been talking about something like this on the Mac side for
quite a while, and things are currently afoot. It is not a file, but a way
to query a system-wide database, and it is for more than just MIME mapping
(email address, news server, etc.).

For full details, you'd probably want to read the URI WG archive.  For
a brief description of why, read the spec.  Essentially, it's
considered national (use can vary) and unsafe.

What does HTTP have to do with URLs?  URLs are supposed to be very
transportable, enough so they can be mailed or printed in newspapers
or scrawled on the back of a cocktail napkin.

Subject: Structural v. semantic markup
content-length: 967

Looking back over the discussions lately, I've noticed that people are
starting to use "semantic markup" as though it were a synonym for
"structural markup."  Let's nip this one in the bud before the masses get a
hold of it.

SGML and our favorite DTD, HTML, can enable semantic markup, but they don't
have to.  It's not even clear to me that without combining a database with
hypertext, semantic markup is even possible.  Let me try and draw the
distinction; as usual, clarification is welcome.

Structural markup means that you name document elements in the context
their  relationship with one another, the whole, and other documents.

Semantic markup, which is uncommon, associates document elements with
lexical relationships.  For example, if I make a reference to Microsoft, I
might include a semantic tag whose lexical relationship is "is a" and
content is "public company."  Relationships might also be fuzzy, as in our
Topics, rather than explicit.

I very much agree; other platforms such as Macs and DOS/Windows should
have standard locations and defined semantics for mailcap files so
that mappings could be shared and maintained in only one place.

Currently these things only exist under UNIX and, based on previous
events, I'm not sure anybody in the world other than me and Nathaniel
have a serious interest in mailcap definitions.  Should have had a
mailcap BOF in Chicago. :-)

Some more rambling.

That certainly makes sense to me.  You might want to go further
than allowing parts to be returned out of order though, you
might want to allow them to be returned in packets out of
order (well, for each request the contents would be in order).
This would enable what Mozilla does (which gives the appearance
rof greater speed, and updates the little dohickeys on the screen
faster than the big images you may care less about) without
requiring multiple TCP connections.  This also handles the case
of a multi-threaded server which is doing conversion on the fly,
body parts which are slow to convert simply appear less often
in the data stream.  That said, I'm not certain it's worth the complexity.

There's another reason that Mozilla does it that way which goes
beyond just making a pretty display.  It's finding out the image
sizes on the fly and sizing the text around them, which makes
the entire page usable sooner and can cut down considerably on the
redraws.  That could be addressed by providing a protocol to get
the size information, or by requiring that the HTML doc contain
the size info (which I believe Mozilla's extensions do allow).
Of course none of that helps much for arbitrary wrap around images.

Speaking of inlines.  Has anyone tried doing inline audio?  
I have this vision of something like:
    <audio src="foo.au" repeat>
to give nice ambience to a page.

Why not use an ALT tag?

This is an excellent example of how we do NOT want to see HTTP
progressing, such that clients say things they don't really mean and
servers try to read clients' minds.  A client should not send */*
unless it really means it, and a server should take it at face value.
This is supposed to be data transfer, not artificial intelligence.

I too think that it represents a decent summary of this issue.

The desire to do multiple HEAD transactions is a powerful argument in favor
of holding off closing this issue.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to eventually
want multiple HEADs, CHECKOUTs, PUTs, and DELETEs, at least.  Multiple HEADs
may also be useful for the Interpedia project, for instance (getting there,
folks); it is a nice way to get back general metainformation about multiple
objects.

Reading the design objectives again make it look like the proposal is a
touch too "inline images"-centric.  John, can you suggest a simple way to
modify the proposal to handle other methods?  I personally don't see any
need to be able to support a mix of methods in a single connection; I'm
mainly going to want to do a whole bunch of HEADs, or a whole bunch of
CHECKINs, for instance.  This consideration should make it easier to modify
the proposal without losing its basic simplicity.

Since this is HTTP 2.0, we're talking about, I don't see any reason to not

Agreed.

I guess a _little_ bit of state isn't too bad.  This would solve the
problem; I wouldn't object to including something like this is the proposal.

Hah!  Its the Night of the Living HTML books!

Since Mary and Andrew have plugged thier books, I'll plug mine:

Mine is part of the Sams' Publishing Teach Yourself series;  its
called "Teach Yourself HTML Web Publishing in a Week," and discusses
not only the various aspects of HTML, Web servers, gateways, forms,
and imagemaps, but also focusses strongly on style and structure and
navigation.  In other words, its not just a referece, its also 
a style guide.

Out in mid-december.

Looks like they forgot one:  Ampersand (&), which is used
as the entity reference open delimiter in HTML.

This "optimisation" may happen to work now but I think it is the wrong
approach for the long run.  Maybe we need clients to send something like:
    Accept: text/html, text/plain, image/gif; img
So that servers could make better presentation choices
for ISMAP/Spacejump images.

Sounds yucky to me, just thinking out loud.

It'd be nice if the MGET response could be multiplexed somehow - I don't 
know how much overhead that would add, but it would have the benefits of

1) (as Steinar wants and the prime benefit of Mcom's parallel download) 
page layout can happen much much sooner.

2) smaller images complete downloading sooner, so if the download were to
hang halfway (as connections oftentimes do) the chances are greater that 
more objects would have been completely obtained (the flip side is that 
it also increases the chances that you have half-objects)

There are enough benefits from the current MGET proposal to not make this 
necessary in my mind, but it'd be nice if the possibility for this was 
always left open for the next HTTP rev.

Some versions of EBCDIC corrupt it.  Also I believe there were problems a
while back with some proxy/cache systems because they disagreed on what
~ meant.  Check the archives for specifics.

I would much prefer to see something like /home/user/ anyway.  Pure
DOS/Windows/MAC users aren't going to have a clue what ~ means and
/home fits in with "home page".

Seems to me that if something is broken, it needs to be fixed.
Why support something so obviously wrong? Bugward combatibility
can be taken too far, especially on something so dynamic as
the WWW.

I would say that if a new browser (Mosaic, Mozilla) was released
at about the same time the servers were updated, then the
problem would largely be solved: people would update.

It's possible to use user authentication in an if-modified-since request,
yes?  If so then the following should work:

C: "Is this user/pass combo allowed to have this document?"
S: "Yes." 
or 
S: "No." connection closed.

C: "Has it been changed?"
S: "Yes, here it is." ...document....
S: "No." connection closed.

I see lots of 304's in my access logs with user names attached so I know 
some browser out there is doing this right....

With local caching the only problem is if there's data in the 
user-authenticated pages you don't want others to see (which is probably 
true if it's under authentication in the first place), which makes the
security of the cache itself an issue.  Hmmm.

Hi,

I was wondering if there is a resource list of firms or institutes
searching for HTML programmers.

If you know of such a company or database site please let me know.

Thanks

 I think that my script is better than this server.

Subject: WWW support for Cyrillic?

A colleague asked me if WWW (or HTML?) supports  the Cyrillic
alphabet. Sounds like a font issue to me, but I'm not sure...
Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks.

PS: if I'm asking the wrong group, please flame/redirect via email. :-)

The web has inspired the ultimate modern oxymoron:  "HTML books".

A year ago you couldn't find a book on the Internet in non-technical
book stores.  Last week I saw three shelves in Waldenbooks.  There
is a justification for buying such a book:  the disks!  I have to
write a letter of justification to buy software but books come out
of petty cash.  But it's really hard to find a book with a disk
that justifies the purchase.  :-)

What's next?  HTML garage sales?

Can we kill this thread?

I don't agree with you here. What the style sheet is good for
is to specify the appearence of the table border rather than its
presence of absence for specific tables.

In my view, style sheets should allow authors to specify how the
document is formatted at a range of window sizes, taking into
account user preferences and platform limitations. The basic
mechanism is to define style info as production rules.

The left hand side of the production operates on:

    a)  attribute values and tag names

    b)  the context in which some element appears

    c)  other parameters such as the age of the
        document and the current window size

    d)  available resources, e.g. font name/size.

The right hand side of the production specifies:

    a)  nodal properties such as font name/size for
        some element, plus color and margin indents

    b)  spatial relationships like above, below,
        left-of, right-of

The production is also associated with a weight following H&kon Lie's
suggestion for cascading style sheets. I will be working with H&kon to
refine this approach and implement it as part of the W3O testbed browser.
We believe that it can be implemented efficiently and will lead to the
ability to handle arbitrary SGML DTDs.

The criterium I used is this: can I think of a situation where having
a border changes the *meaning* of the table? If there are tables where
borders are more than just decorative, then the BORDER attribute
should definitely stay in HTML. If not,... well, I don't really mind.

I like this summary of input/output information. (a) and (b) are a
subset of ESIS. If you move `window size' from (c) to (d) then you can
make a distinction between document meta-info (c) and resources (d).

There is one other requirement implicit in all the proposals so far:
for as much as possible the formatting process is driven by the HTML
in the order that it is received. This ensures that a smart browser
can start formatting when the data is still coming in.

There are exceptions, of course, most notably tables and math. But
still this should be a good guideline in keeping the style language
simple. Note that DSSSL works quite differently. It assumes that the
whole of the document is available as a sort of random access
database, from which it selects the text to put in the next free
frame.

I've already expressed my doubt that styles *can* be combined with
such a simple mechanism. It reminds me of one of Donald Knuth's tricks
with his Metafont language: finding a font halfway between, say, Times
and Helvetica. (It is described somewhere in Douglas Hofstadter's
`Metamagical Themas')

However, I agree that it would be useful if there were an easy (for
the user and the machine) mechanism to change styles intuitively, for
example: `make less gaudy', `make colour-blind safe', `zoom in/out',
`reverse colours'. And I know a number of people who would be very
happy with the ability to view (almost) arbitrary SGML with at least
some formatting.

Yes, of course that's ugly.  The proper solution would be to have
something like a <FIG> tag which is a wrapper, and inside the wrapper
could go a complete textual representation of the page as a list or
menu or whatever.  We'll continue to have these problems until <IMG>
is dead and buried and replaced by something that's well-designed.
But this is a problem to be solved at the HTML level, not the HTTP
level.

> I think that my script is better than this server.

Er, actually, lots of Lynx clients send "image/gif" in the Accept:
field, depending how the mailcap file is configured.  The inclusion of
"image/gif" absolutely does not tell you that a viewer can display
inlined images, nor does its absence tell you a viewer cannot do so.
Somebody may actually make a client that (gasp!) realizes that if you
send */* in an Accept: field there is no point in sending anything
else unless there are some additional values.

Your script is the HTTP equivalent of using invisible GIFs to try to
center text; whether that's a good or bad thing is a religious
question, but it's certainly a brittle thing.

(Now, how long until somebody invents an HTTP equivalent to colored
balls as list bullets? :-)

although i've never actually tried to install

Folks,

I am interested in the question of selecting a server platform.

For example, are these guesses correct:

  unix gets the earliest ports of new server software (are some 
  unices more desirable than others)?

  unix server software is least prone to crashes

  unix server software has more features

  unix has the most development tools

  Macintosh server software is easiest to install

  Macintosh has the easiest to use development tools

  Windows server hardware is cheapest when disk space is taken into account

  Windows server software is most crash prone

  the size of the Windows market may cause servers and tools to 
  improve significantly by the time Windows95 is out

  Windows has the most development tools

What are the important differences?  Are there classes of user 
and application for which unix is a must?  For whom a Mac or 
Windows is the best choice?

It's not so much the HTML issues as the browser/server issue. The browser
needs to be able to render Cyrillic alphabet.

1) It provides a means for typing (as in assigning a type to) message data.

2) It provides a means of associating data types with data handlers.

3) It's trivial to parse (so trivial, in fact, that people don't bother
   to consult the RFCs first and end up making a mess of it).

4) It's completely extensible.

5) It's an Internet protocol, and people who matter like it when Internet
   protocols are reused, rather than reinvented.

Of course, that doesn't mean we can't move on to a different method
in the future.  However, data types are (probably) always going to be
named with MIME content-type identifiers, simply because we'd never
agree on the names otherwise.

On a different thread, people have noted that many current browsers do not
support mime parameters, e.g.

    Content-type: text/html; level=3

This is true, but should not be used as an excuse to implement and
distribute MORE clients that can't parse MIME properly.  It WILL be in
the HTTP/1.0 specification, and new client authors will be expected to abide
by that specification.  Eventually, servers will be able to send parameters
in MIME types without worrying about clients barfing -- it is a requirement
for enabling extensions to data types, as well as for supporting complex
parameterized data types like text/sgml.

Has anyone else noticed this? 

Recently I've noticed several servers generating output customised for
the browser that is being used - eg http://www.netmarket.com, if you
connect using m*saic, suggests that you change to using m*zilla (aside
from the fact that I cannot get m*zilla for my decstation, thats a fine
idea :), but I digress). And theres at least one other server out there
that tries to customise all output so that it looks best on whichever
browser you are using (and as a result, produces far too much broken
HTML.)

Seems to me this is another example of why we need stylesheets - if
providers are to the point of customising the output for your browser,
then there's obviously a need for control over presentation.

I'm dreading the day where pages are just one large imagemap gif of the
page, exactly as the provider wants it to look.

You know?  I would think developers would be balking the most at the
extensions that MCOM has injected for the simple reason that every
browser will now have to support CENTER, FONT, etc. **AS WELL AS** the
accepted standard mechanisms -- to make sure that all documents are
displayed optimally. 

When we have style-sheets (REAL SOON NOW), we now have to support two
seperate methods of achieving the same goals, without any consideration
whatsoever for the complexity this represents to the developer or even if 
it is possible.

Has MCOM killed the possibility of supporting stylesheets in any useful and 
rational way?  What is the impact of 

	H1: orient=right, ff=times_roman, size=24p, fore=blue

and

	<CENTER><H1>Header Text</H1></CENTER>

?

This is a (substantial) revision of Ernesto Nebel's original proposal
for 'file upload'; it followed discussions at the File Upload BOF at
the Chicago WWW, and various conversations with a large number of
individuals, including Jay Weber and Alan Schiffman at EIT, Ned Freed,
Keith Ball.

FILE TRANSMISSION FROM WORLD WIDE WEB BROWSERS TO SERVERS

I. Introduction
---------------

Currently, a World Wide Web server can get information from users with
HTML forms.  These forms have proven useful in a wide variety of
applications in which input from the user is necessary.  But this
capability is still greatly limited because HTML forms don't provide a
way for the user to submit files to the server.  Service providers who
need to get files from the user have had to implement custom browsers.
(Examples of these custom browsers have appeared on the www-talk
mailing list.)  To avoid the necessity for custom browsers and to make
WWW servers complete in their ability to get information from the
user, the WWW needs to provide a way for users to send files to
servers.  Since user information is sent back to the server using HTML
forms, it is most logical to extend HTML forms to support file
submission.


II. HTML forms with file submission
-----------------------------------

The current draft HTML specification <URL:http://www.hal.com/%7Fconno
lly/html-spec/spyglass-19941014/html-19941014.txt.Z> defines eight
possible values for the attribute TYPE of an INPUT element: CHECKBOX,
HIDDEN, IMAGE, PASSWORD, RADIO, RESET, SUBMIT, TEXT.

In addition, it defines the default ENCTYPE attribute of the FORM
element to have the default type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

This proposal makes two changes: 

1) add a FILE option for the TYPE attribute of INPUT
2) allow the ENCTYPE of a FORM to be "multipart/www-form"

(These changes might be considered independently, but are both
necessary for reasonable file upload).

The author of an HTML form who wants to request one or more files from
a user would write (for example):

   <FORM ENCTYPE="multipart/www-form" ACTION="...url...">

    File to process: <INPUT NAME="userfile1" TYPE="file">

The change to the HTML DTD is trivial: just one item added to the
entity "InputType", as follows:


.. (other elements) ...

<!ENTITY % InputType "(TEXT | PASSWORD | CHECKBOX |
                       RADIO | SUBMIT | RESET |
                       IMAGE | HIDDEN | FILE )">
<!ELEMENT INPUT - 0 EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST INPUT
        TYPE %InputType TEXT
        NAME CDATA #IMPLIED  -- required for all but submit and reset
        VALUE CDATA #IMPLIED
        SRC %URI #IMPLIED  -- for image inputs --
        CHECKED (CHECKED) #IMPLIED
        SIZE CDATA #IMPLIED  --like NUMBERS,
                                but delimited with comma, not space
        MAXLENGTH NUMBER #IMPLIED
        ALIGN (top|middle|bottom) #IMPLIED
        >

.. (other elements) ...

This is the minimal change requested. Other, larger changes to the
InputType entity might also be contemplated but are not part of this
proposal. For example, an INPUT element might usefully have an
attribute which identifies a set of acceptable media-types, e.g.,
<INPUT TYPE=FILE ACCEPT="image/gif, image/tiff" NAME="image1">.

III. Proposed implementation
----------------------------

The proposed implementation in WWW browsers is, when a INPUT tag of
type FILE is encountered, to show a a display of (previously selected)
file names, and a "Browse" button or selection method. Selecting the
"Browse" button would cause the browser to enter into a file selection
mode appropriate for the platform. Window-based browsers might pops up
a file selection window, for example. In such a file selection dialog,
the user would have the option of replacing a current selection,
adding a new file selection, etc. Browser implementors might choose
let the list of file names be manually edited.

When the user completes the form, and selects the SUBMIT element, the
browser should send the form data and the content of the selected
files. The encoding type "application/x-url-encoded" is inefficient
for efficiently sending large quantities of binary data. Thus, a (new)
media type, "multipart/www-form" is proposed as a way of efficiently
sending the values associated with a filled-out form from client to
server.

The media-type (MIME-type) "multipart/www-form-data" follows the rules
of all multipart MIME data streams as outlined in RFC 1521: a boundary
is selected that does not occur (with more than infinitessimal
probability) in any of the data. Each field of the form is sent, in
the order in which it occurs in the form, as a part of the multipart
stream.  Each part identifies the INPUT name within the original HTML
form using a "Name: " attribute. Each part has an optional
Content-Type (which defaults to text/plain). File inputs should be
identified as either application/binary or the appropriate media type,
if known. If multiple files were selected, they should be transferred
together using the multipart/mixed format. The
"content-transfer-encoding" for each part should be "binary". File
inputs may optionally identify the file name using the
"Content-Description" header. Browers may optionally include a
Content-Length header both in the reply and in individual components;
the content-length is not intended as a replacement for the boundary
but just as a way forwarning the server of the amount of data coming.

On the server end, the ACTION might point to a HTTP URL that
implements the forms action via CGI. In such a case, the CGI program
would note that the content-type is multipart/www-form-data, parse the
various fields (checking for validity, writing the file data to local
files for subsequent processing, etc.).

IV. Backward compatibility issues
---------------------------------

While not necessary for successful adoption of an enhancement to the
current WWW form mechanism, it is useful to also plan for a migration
strategy: users with older browsers can still participate in file
upload dialogs, using a 'helper' application. Most current browers
that we have investigated, when given <INPUT TYPE=FILE>, will treat it
as <INPUT TYPE=TEXT> and give the user a text box. The user can type
in a file name into this text box. In addition, current browsers seem
to ignore the ENCTYPE parameter in the <FORM> element, and always
transmit the data as application/x-url-encoded.

Thus, the server CGI might be written in a way that would note that
the form data returned had content-type application/x-url-encoded
instead of multipart/www-form-data, and know that the user was using
a browser that didn't implement file upload.

In this case, rather than replying with a "text/html" response, the
CGI on the server could instead send back something that a 'helper'
application might process instead.

It would take the URL-encoded form data it got, identify which of the
fields actually should be substituted with its content, and send the
entire form back to the client, identified with a *new* MIME type:
"application/x-please-send-files". The data in
application/x-please-send-files contains all of the original form data
supplied, and the URL which the multipart/www-form-data should
actually be sent.

The simplest design for application/x-please-send-files would be:
 the URL to actually send the data (one line)
 the names of fields whose values should be replaced with files (space
     separated, on one line)
 all of the form data, as originally sent to the server.

The browser would need to be configured to process
application/x-please-send-files to launch a helper application.

The helper would read the form data, note which fields contained
'local file names' that needed to be replaced with their data content,
might itself prompt the user for changing or adding to the list of
files available, and then repackage the data & file contents in
multipart-www-form-data for retransmission back to the server.

The helper would generate the kind of data that a 'new' browser should
actually have sent in the first place, with the intention that the URL
to which it is sent corresponds to the original ACTION URL. The point
of this is that the server can use the *same* CGI to implement the
mechanism for dealing with both old and new browsers.

The helper need not display the form data, but *should* ensure that
the user actually be prompted about the suitability of sending the
files requested (this is to avoid a security problem with malicious
servers that ask for files that weren't actually promised by the
user.) It would be useful if the status of the transfer of the files
involved could be displayed.

V.  Other considerations
------------------------

Compression:

This scheme doesn't address the possible compression of files. After
some consideration, it seemed that the optimization issues of file
compression were too complex to try to automatically have browsers
decide that files should be compressed. Many link-layer transport
mechanisms (e.g., high-speed modems) perform data compression over the
link, and optimizing for compression at this layer might not be
appropriate. It might be possible for browsers to optionally produce
a content-transfer-encoding of x-compress for file data, and for
servers to decompress the data before processing, if desired; this was
left out of the proposal, however.

Deferred file transmission:

In some situations, it might be advisable to have the server validate
various elements of the clients data (user name, account, etc.) before
actually preparing to receive the data. However, after some
consideration, it seemed best to require that servers that wish to do
this should implement this as a series of forms, where some of the
data elements that were previously validated might be sent back to the
client as 'hidden' fields. This puts the onus of maintaining the state
of a transaction only on those servers that wish to build a complex
application, while allowing those cases that have simple input needs
to be built simply.

Other choices for return transmission of binary data:

Various people have suggested using new mime top-level type
"aggregate", e.g., aggregate/mixed or a content-transfer-encoding of
"packet" to express indeterminate-length binary data, rather than
relying on the multipart-style boundaries. While I'm not opposed to
doing so, this would require additional design and standardization
work to get acceptance of "aggregate". On the other hand, the
'multipart' mechanisms are well established, trivial to implement on
both the sending client and receiving server, and as efficient as
other methods of dealing with multiple combinations of binary data.

Not overloading <INPUT>:

Various people have wondered about the advisability of overloading
'INPUT' for this function, rather than merely providing a different
type of FORM element. Among other considerations, the
migration strategy which is allowed when using <INPUT> is important.
In addition, the <INPUT> field *is* already overloaded to contain most
kinds of data input; rather than creating multiple kinds of <INPUT>
tags, it seems most reasonable to enhance <INPUT>. The 'type' of INPUT
is not the content-type of what is returned, but rather the
'widget-type'; i.e., it identifies the interaction style with the
user. The description here is carefully written to allow <INPUT
TYPE=FILE> to work for text browsers or audio-markup.

VI. Conclusion
--------------
The suggested implementation gives the client a lot of flexibility in
the number and types of files it can send to the server, it gives the
server control of the decision to accept the files, and it gives
servers a chance to interact with browsers which do not support INPUT
TYPE "file".

The change to the HTML DTD is very simple, but very powerful.  It
enables a much greater variety of services to be implemented via the
World Wide Web than is currently possible due to the lack of a file
submission facility.  This would be an extremely valuable addition to
the capabilities of the World Wide Web.

Lots of people have been designing separate areas for text based and 
graphics based browsers; as HTML splinters, so too will HTML pages.  It's 
completely inevitable with the current evolution (or mutation, depending 
on your point of view) of the standard.

Concede: HTML is as big a failure as it is a success.  I hardly think 
that pages like

<UL>
<LI>Click *here* if you're using Mozilla!
<LI>Click *here* if you're using Xmosaic!
<LI>Click *here* if you're using Lynx!
[etc...]
</UL>

were intended when we started playing this logical markup game.  (Use of 
click *here* intentional, yes, I hate it, this is called point belaboring.)

I think that's been obvious since day 1.5.  The question of deployment is 
a stickier business.

No no, one large imagemap jpeg.  Scarcity of resources and all that...

MCOM has already stated the reasons for including <CENTER> without
<P ALIGN="CENTER">; if they are to be believed (which I certainly think 
they are!) support for the latter tag will be in the non-beta release.  
This means don't use <CENTER> if you don't like it, and unless enough

to exist, <CENTER> will drift off into the sunset.

As to <FONT>, that's another day.  Ye who do not take control of HTML

MCOM can't kill anything we as the "web community" don't put on the chopping 
block first.  Look at the impact of Mosaic (it's the killer ap, it's the 
greatest, it's revolutionizing!), then the impact of NetScape (it's an 
even better killer ap, it's the greatest, it's superrevolutionizing!), if 
we all want style sheets so badly, when FooBrowser comes arond the bend 
in six months and implements them perfectly, we'll have to come up with some 
new praises.

I think the reason so much heat is being generated over this (apparently
minor) nit, is that Mosaic pushed a lot of people into getting TCP/IP
onto their desktops (for the Mac/PC crowd). Most of the implementations
have static tables that limit the number of sockets available for general
use. The same is true of a number of older Unix implementations. I seem 
to recall 64 as being a general number. Some limited this to 32 mainly
due to a faulty implementation of "select" and the FD_xxx bit-setting
macros limited to longword sizes.

The heat seems to come from people who would like to see their own
apps run on all these desktops, but are concerned that either their app
will run out of sockets to use when a user unknowingly sets the connection
count to a ridiculously large number, and then tries to multitask their
app as well, or from those who now are faced with having to open a similar
number of connections if only to appear as "fast" as NetScape when
transferring information.

In either case, it all boils down to whether you want to cooperate
with the rest, or reach for as many free resources as you can get your
mitts on. The NetScape approach does up the ante: now everyone is going
to have a "number of connections" in their clients (or worse, they won't
even ask, just grab 'em all).

I worked on a server with a client library 3-4 years ago that opened multiple
sockets on demand. It was decided after the first pass that this was
not a good neighbor thing to do and it was taken out. We figured it would 
piss off a lot of people. Kinda glad now (;-)

I wish instead of going this route, the MCC guys had sat down and come with
a nice UDP-based lightweight binary protocol with built-in compression
and caching that would seriously kick butt... 

Just day-dreaming here...

Sigh...

Sorry for the bother.  The load from these www-* mailing lists has been
causing problems for CERN's main mail gateway, which has in turn been
causing problems for the lists.  This is a test of a new mail configuration
which should bypass the mail gateway (for outbound mail) as much as possible.

I already tested the test mailing list -- but as I discovered last weekend,
that doesn't mean that this list will also work..

When you only have a few colours (as in a drawing) a GIF may be more
compact and will certainly look better (ie. no artifacts).

 I know I shouldn't send this message here, but I complained several times to
listmaster@www0.cern.ch without answer. And since this broken list processor
will strip my Cc:, here it is: listmaster@www0.cern.ch,
	www-talk-request@www0.cern.ch, postmaster@www0.cern.ch

 Could administrators of this list be nice enough to set an out-of-band
"From" other than the list itself (i.e. owner-www-talk@www0.cern.ch with
sendmail) ?

 It would avoid the whole list to receive error messages when an MTA doesn't
look at the "Errors-to" field.

This is one of the reasons for a clean versioning scheme, e.g.

        Accept: text/html; version=3.0

Any browser that sends this in their request would be guaranteeing that it
can handle tables, math, figures, etc. as defined in the IETF ratified RFC.

By keeping HTML 3.0 clean and simple, we can make this broad interoperability
a reality. Any browsers that don't include the version number would be assumed
to lack support for 3.0. In this way servers can provide down graded HTML 2.0
documents to older clients. Is anyone interested in helping to write a filter
for 3.0 -> 2.0?

(Less talk and more work :)

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

p.s. we may want to specify a range of version numbers, so that the client
can inform servers the earliest and latest versions of html it supports.

Just for the record, in the neolithic environment of DOS/Windows, there is 
no guarantee that a helper application can function as a separate process 
that takes over the TCP/IP socket to the Web server.  Some Windows TCP/IP 
versions that conform to the WinSock API may allow it, but it is not 
required by the spec.  The best that can be done is to write the helper as a 
DLL (dynamically-linked library, similar to a UNIX shared library).

This is overcome in Windows NT, as a socket is just a special kind of file 
descriptor.  Does anyone have enough Windows95 experience to comment on its 
capabilities?

Is it worthwhile to now consider some kind of efficiency measure for file 
upload such that uploads only occur when space exists for the uploaded 
files?  If so, would this measure be best accomplished by means of a 
separate HTTP method like METRICS (<2EA55482@MSMAIL.INDY.TCE.COM>), or by 
some other means?

 I'm not really sure, I'm not a specialist of Lynx (I prefer "www" :-)) but
apparently, without mailcap Lynx is like www :
  * when it run in an xterm it send "image/gif", "application/postscript" ...
  * otherwise it don't send these header lines.

 I want to know :

 1) Why Lynx, Mosaic, Netscape, www ... send always a field "Accept:
image/gif" in the first request, even if the user don't want receive a GIF
image. 

 2) why, in the example of "MGET", in the first request there is only
"text/html; text/plain" and then a request with "image/gif". For me there
is no negociation between the server and the client. Perhaps it's better to
make the choice of Chimera and send "Accept: */*"

 3) why Netscape never send a field "Accept: application/postscript" even
if the user want receive a PostScript document.

 I've the same problem, with the same CGI script, it can send a PostScript
document or a document HTML. This script must send systematically a
PostScript document or it must check the header line ?


Guy Decoux

p.s. it's more important, for me, to receive a header line
"Accept-Language", and this is also an user choice (I want receive french
documents :-))

Two numbers would be an advantage instead of one - in this way you can
specify a max and a min version supported. With the evolution of the
Web, it might be very difficult to preserve backwards compatibility
forever.

Does the Line Mode Browser also support UNICODE ? It seems to me that 
supporting UNICODE is a good thing. You'd get Cyrillic, Kanji, and anything 
else that does not fit into U.S. ASCII. Judging by this list people are
luke worm to the idea of supporting UNICODE. Why is that ?

	Regards,
	Vladimir.

I'm not going to tell you to run out and purchase a Unix work-
station, but it seems to me that the critical considerations in
a lot of cases are multi-user capability, and the ability to be
remotely maintained.

Often no one person is responsible for everything residing on
a given server.  Some people will be responsible for some areas
and others for other areas.  And not all of them will be able
to be physically present at the console.  It's just much easier
to run the server under Unix so they can log in - any time (all
at once, perhaps) - to work.

Then, of course, there's the problem of a crash or something
else while you're at home.  Under Unix, it's no problem to do
maintenance on the machine wherever you are, just so long as
you have Internet or dial-in access.

The main problem with Unix, of course, is that it is large and
diverse, and to use it effectively takes some specialized know-
ledge.

What are the differences between the types of unnumbered lists,
both functional and appearance?

Thanks much,

Another idea is to use the LPD style exchange where the name and
the size of the file are presented to the client first. Followed
by the client actually requesting the file.
 
For example, 250 foo.bar (file foo.bar, size 250 bytes).

	Vladimir.

Sometimes there seems to be an interesting dichotomy growing with regard to
presentation. There exists a noble wish to restrict HTML to primarily a
logical markup language. Those who wish control over presentation are often
pointed towards an external format such as PDF, or reduced to having to use
bitmapped images. Yet, it seems that such a solution is the worst possible
solution since we lose all logical markup (and most presentation control for
the user). It seems that an early appearance of style sheets (and HTML 3.0)
is our only hope. (Will MCom be the savior? They certainly appear to be in
the strongest position right now.)

(I also seem to recall that a year ago the HTML spec gave suggestions for
how the browser might display the elements. This seems to have been lost
in the specs that have appeared since.)

Just what I think I see,
-Robert

Yes, but you can't do searches on the text and can't view them on
non-graphic terminals.

Because it is capable of accepting and displaying a GIF image by

Because Netscape already sends a global wildcard (although it appears
to do so incorrectly), making enumeration of types redundant.

Well, that's one of the limitations of the spec; it never says what a
server should do if it wants to deliver an object in a CT that the
client didn't indicate a willingness to Accept:.

Several reasons, in my estimation:

    1) Unicode increases overhead, being 16-bit rather than 8
    2) It is not supported by GUIs
    3) 16-bit characters aren't supported by compilers
    4) US/European programmers are cultural chauvenists

Of course most of these objections are spurious:

    1) UTF-8 allows for backwards 8-bit compatibility, adding
       to storage requirements only for characters outside the
       one-byte range
    2) (valid objection)
    3) Wide characters should be supported by ANSI-conformant
       compilers and libraries
    4) US and European programmers aren't stupid; they are just
       not terribly aware of the situation in countries like
       Russia, India, Japan, etc.  Give them gentle nudges, and
       they *will* respond....

Adding multi-language capability to the Web is going to take time,
because it will require changes to HTML, to servers, and to clients.
Given the lack of multilingual support in most GUIs, a lot of new
widgets will have to be created, and people will have to stretch
themselves to learn how things like Japanese and Arabic scripts
work.  It's going to take time, but it appears we'll get there.

Right here several things have been hashed out.  For example, we
all pretty much seem to agree that LANG and CHARSET or CODEPAGE
attributes will be needed for HTML (with some sensible defaults).
We've also come to the realization that logical ordering of data
is the only way to go.  The "visual" ordering that MIME allows
for embedded Hebrew or Arabic just won't work in the long run.
So we have to bite the bullet and make sure that clients can
do the visual reordering themselves for mixed right-left/left-
right languages.  (There is, by the way, a terribly explained al-
gorithm for doing this in appendix A volume 1 of the old pub-
lished Unicode standard; I can supply people with a more prac-
tical tutorial if anyone wants it.)

Things *are* happening.  Be patient, and offer to help.  Inject
comments where you feel they will be appropriate.  Cut some code
if you know how; otherwise, do some research on scripts and stand-
ards in various countries and help guide the process.  Above all,
though, don't complain.  Help us out!

	Before I get a barrage of these, I had better complete the ellipsis (..)
	- I wasn't advocating this as *the* approach; it has other drawbacks
	too. My unstated point was that there *may well be* applications for
	which presentation is so important that extraordinary implementations
	might be considered. For example, a WWW-based newspaper that gets
	its revenue from advertising would like to ensure that the ads
	are nicely integrated with the surrounding text, and don't get
	switched off. One (Procrustean) way would be to make the whole
	page an image. BUT I hope that the advent of <Table> and beautiful

I use it a couple of places, most prominently on the subscriber form to warn
users of WinMosaic or MacWeb or WinWeb that their browsers do *not* work on
HotWired (the first can't post in a user-authenticated area, the latter 
don't have user authentication).  Nowhere do I use it to function as a 
way to make things look different for different browsers.

Well, in my case is represents a need for quality control.

For online browsing?  Yeesh.

Do they also want to preserve the style of stopping
in the middle of a sentence and saying "Continued on
page 32, column 4"?

The hypertext version of the HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) 
reference manual at NCSA does something like that.  All the 
tables in the original document get turned into GIFs for
the HTML version.

Since most of the important information is in the tables,
they hypertext version is almost useless.  You can't search
for a text string, you can't read the thing at all in
Lynx, and I can't even read it on my X terminal with Mosaic
or Netscape since the images eat all available server memory.
Worst of all, none of the tables really *need* to be tables 
in the first place: they could all be rendered quite effectively
with <Hn>s and lists.

(See <HURL:http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001/refman/refmanual.html>
for the offending document.  Make sure you've got some time
to kill before you follow any of the sublinks.)

Richard,

Thanks for your reply. I agree, in general, with your estimate
of the state of the art of this issue. I just want to point out a few
things. First, Microsoft GUI (the 32-bit one) supports UNICODE,
so does MS Visual C++. I know that this does not solve the problem
for non-windows platforms. Second, EMWAC supports UNICODE in
their release of HTTP server. I believe (please correct me if I am
wrong), that NCSA Mosaic browser supports Unicode as well. The URL of 
the UNICODE testing facility for browser developers  is:

http://emwac.ed.ac.uk/html/internet_toolchest/UNICODE.HTM

		Vladimir.

<CENTER> was for situations were you want to center
a large section of the document instead of individual
pieces.  Sticking 'align=center' on every element
in a document gets tedious, and HTML doesn't (yet) have
a general-purpose SECTION or DIVISION element.

Eric Bina says he didn't have time to implement the ALIGN
attribute on all the other tags, but it will be done in 
the 1.0 release.  (IMO, if the Netscape HTML parser is implemented
anything like the Mosaic HTML parser, it's understandable
that there wasn't enough time to implement it.)

I'll volunteer!  Just get me a DTD...

I'm currently working on some general-purpose SGML-to-HTML 
utilities for CoST.  CoST is currently much too slow to be 
used as an on-demand server-side filter, but the basic ideas
should be transferable to other utilities.

This is where secure http comes in. We can use http to download programs
from "trusted" sources. The trust hierarchies determine who you trust
directly or indirectly and for what kinds of things. Phill Hallam-Baker
can explain this much better than I can. The next idea is to allow http
headers to be used to map a content type to the URL/URN for a matching
application module for displaying it inline. The integration technology would
be based on OLE or OpenDoc or what ever is appropriate to each platform.
Client-server negotiation resolves the URL/URN to whichever application module
is needed for each platform. I hope to work with W3O on exploring this for
real sometime next year.

Hello,

	I am currently using NCSA httpd server V1.3 (PRE), but I 
am experiencing problems with Socket connection resets, when I send
forms that are larger than about 10K.  I am running the server on
a Zeos Pantera 90 megahertz.  Is this a known problem that I have 
failed to unearth in the Faqs that I have been reading, has anyone
else seen this problem, or am I doing Something wrong.  Even
a friend who worked up at NCSA, developing on Unix servers and Mosaic
is stumped.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Daniel

I think that would be wrong. Electronic texts, hypertext, WWW pages,
what have you, are at their best when you have short texts (typically
a screenful) interlinked with links for linear reading as well as
cross references.

Now you would think that this was an ideal medium to present news
(real news as opposed to USENET), a better looking, easier to use,
alternative to the teletext systems found on many european TV

This is not good. In fact, this is bad. This means that they haven't
grasped the possibilities and limitations of the new medium. 

This approach will give you good screenshots, when you're referred in
the trade rags, but it will not give you a usable Web newspaper.

Because they try not to be broken, and only ask for what is sensible for that 
request rather than sending the same Accept headers with every request. After 
all, if my client has asked for a document, sending text/html is necessary and 
text/plain seems to be conventional but chemical/pdb is probably superfluous.

I mention the latter because Arena, having read my mailcap, sends that out when 
it asks for html documents, etc.

Because it is broken, but up till now that didn't matter much in practice

Linux is free, 'supported' by an extremely large newsgroup (4
specialized groups, actually). It is undergoing constant improvement
and upgrades, far more than commercial products. See comp.os.linux.*

Not necessarily. Linux, an increasingly popular unix clone, runs on
the Intel platform. Consequently, the cost of unix hardware is exactly
the same as Windows hardware.

unix has more, but they require more expertise/experience to use.

The Mac or Windows would probably be the best choice for someone
unable or unwilling to undergo the unix learning curve. If this is not
a consideration, then unix is almost certainly the best choice.

Yeah, and it will look horrible on millions of screens where the aspect
ratio doesn't match, the user doesn't have enough colors, and on
high-resolution screens where their "20 point font" is 1cm high.
Not to mention all the text-only clients.

Of course, the market will decide what wins and what doesn't.  If the
"gif/jpeg" pages are slow and ugly then nobody will read them.

Hi all,

I've been watching the discussion on presentation control with interest.

In Message-Id: <9411021636.AA02003@annie.astro.nwu.edu>, Robert A. Lentz
<lentz@annie.astro.nwu.edu> writes:

I agree strongly with Robert here - it seems to me that HTML merely needs to
give a bit more control to document authors - not the whole hog, right down to
the exact fonts, colours, kerning algorithm, resize behaviour etc etc, but
(perhaps) about as much as basic LaTeX commands give a document author (but
definitely not the full complexity of the underlying TeX system!)

Someone gave the example of a newspaper that wanted to be laid out multi-
column.  This seems an eminently reasonable thing to be able to request.
Likewise, that a line of text should be "centred" within the column, without
having to say "it's a citation" if it **isn't** a citation.  Likewise, that
data should be laid out in a tabular format, or as equations (ok, I know these
latter two are coming "real soon now").

In taking an extreme position against "creeping presentationism" :-), and
arguing that HTML is purely for structure, not appearance, I think some people
are forgetting that what is most attractive about the Web is precisely that
HTML documents look **REALLY ATTRACTIVE** on a decent browser like Mosaic.
That's why Web browsers such as Mosaic and its offspring are candidates for
"the killer app of the Internet" - not cos documents are structured!

Before structure lovers start to flame me, let me state that I am enormously
grateful that HTML is a structured layout mechanism (in the LaTeX/troff school)
as opposed, for instance, to RTF or display postscript or some rubbish like
that!  I have a keen regard for using only "legal" HTML, and frequently have
to suggest this to some of my more DTP-happy colleagues who say "if I make this
whole paragraph an <h5>, and then use <b> for a couple of words, then they'll
stand out nicely!"..

>It seems that an early appearance of style sheets (and HTML 3.0)

>From what everyone's been saying about NetScape (Mozilla) it looks like that's
gone way over the top allowing font and colour choice etc, but at least they've
started to add some more new features (and now)!  I'm much happier with a
practical bunch like Mcom experimenting with new features than I am with the
various SGML-inspired ideas that are invading HTML, such as DTDs and style
sheets.  I really think that HTML is, say, 90% of the way there already, and
it just needs a few more commands.

We are aware of the problem but we don't have the personal rescources
to do much about a practical implementation right now. The cyrillic
support is a one-timer and only made thanks to Anton Tropashko,

UDP is the **WRONG** solution.  It will *NOT* work for HTTP-like protocols.

There, now that we are on the same wavelength... :-)

A simple minded UDP-based protocol would very likely consume vastly more
network and system resources than TCP does and if you put all the smarts
of TCP into UDP then you would end up with about the same thing but it
would less efficient because of the need to move the data into and out of
user space on the machines (a double loose).  TCP goes to great lengths
to ensure that it doesn't totally screw your network.  Ever heard of MTU
discovery, windowing, congestion avoidence, etc?  Also, UDP comes with a
whole different set of problems (like machines that ignore UDP checksums).

It would be much easier to do a connectionless TCP interface.

I would highly recommend that long-haul transport protocols be left up to
people who have lots of real-world experience doing them.  What may seem
like obvious common sense and work fine in a high-speed LAN environment
is often a disaster in a WAN environment.

As a random example, normal NFS (which uses UDP) is pretty useless over
a 14.4 modem connection but the BSD folks did an implementation of NFS
using TCP and it works fine (well, it's slow of course but at least you
ever get data out of it, the UDP version just times out).

As for a binary protocol you are assuing that the bulk of the protocol
is a factor here but this is not clearly the case.  Certainly in the big
picture the protocol overhead isn't that great.  There are some performance
issues also and it would probably be a win there but it's not clear that
this is even an issue.  Surely a T1 line will max out long before even a
cheap 486 or Mac would run out of cycles for processing requests.  Larger
data pipes could do it (A T3 for sure) but how many people are hitting
that limitation?  It's not clear that the benifits of a binary protocol
outweigh the additional troubles.  Let's just say that the jury is still
out until I see hard data indicating otherwise.

Compression is another bad idea.  It only really helps if the link is slow
and the major slow link these days is 14.4 modems which already support
compression in the hardware and you actually *loose* on through-put if
you precompress.  This doesn't mean that we shouldn't use JPEG where
they make sense but JPEG isn't just a compression, it's an entire
encoding scheme; totally different issue.

Caching is a different issue with different problems but it is independent
of the underlying transport and is already being done I will not address it.

Windows 95 has the same process creation capabilities as NT, and therefore
can create children that inherit handles to things like sockets. The 
two OSs share the same API (Win32) which is actually pretty nice. Win95
does not support "service" (non-gui daemon type) apps, but you can run
such things as console apps and leave them minimized.

I'm operating a CERN server as a proxy and I've run across a problem when
dealing with POST methods. It seems that the server inserts a 0x00 byte
after the double CR/LF sequence following the Content-Length field and
prior to the content itself.

For example:

...
Content-Length: 100\r\n\r\n\0Here goes 100 bytes of content data.......

Most of the servers I attempt to POST to complain that the first field of
the form I'm sending is missing.

Is there a config option I've missed or is it a bug?

I've heard the Microsoft hoopla, but so far can't determine what it
is all about.  From what I can tell, Microsoft is using Unicode ac-
cording to the old, internationalization/localization model.  It is
not using Unicode as it should be used, namely as a multilingual en-
coding standard.  Take a look at Apple's WorldScript for an example
of that.

If you have the specs on hand, tell me what the 32-bit GUI does with
characters in the Arabic and Hebrew code blocks, by the way.  I am
not fishing for a particular response here, but I suspect that the
system is nonconformant in that it will recognize the codes, but yet
fail to show the behavior outlined in appendix A of the standard.

Gosh I really ought to pepper more smiley faces all around (:-). 
This topic has been beaten about sufficiently in this group.
I just lobbed it in as a wisecrack at the end of a message on an entirely
different topic. 

Just for the record, UDP would work VERY well for HTTP-like protocols. However,
it's obviously a moot point to discuss it when so many servers and browsers
use TCP (and some browsers don't go through lib-www so it would be non-trivial
to switch). New protocols should, however, look into UDP. 

I would be happy to engage in religious UDP vs. TCP discussions
off www-talk. (:-) There's enough traffic here already.

Cheers,

That is, if the client knows how big the files are, it might say. If
the server cares and wants to check, it can and (if necessary) abort
the transfer before all the data has been sent.

This seemed like a simple way to allow clients to supply information
but not to require it, and allow servers to ignore it if they didn't
want to check, all without adding any additional transactions.

One question: how do you want the client to know what is `sensible' for

peeking at the file extension.

The only way the client can optimize this is to avoid redundant
information - like having a long list of accept headers and then '*/*'

Subject: Security in HTTP and caches
content-length: 5848

Following the discussion of client caches, etc....

As somebody else mentioned earlier, it's not good to cache a document if
it requires authorisation.  However, there still exists the problem in
the web that you can't always know if a document is protected! 
Specifically, if a document is being protected by host/client based
authentication.  This happens quite a bit, because it's the only
possible way of saying "this document is available to all academic
sites", without requiring every academic user have a username/password. 
With such a document, only the server knows that it is protected, and so
the client cannot correctly determine whether or not to cache it. 
Exactly the same problem exists with proxy servers (I talked with some
people about this at the Geneva WWW conference...), where the request is
identified as originating from the proxy, and not from the client.  Note
that with this problem, it is not the server which is at fault: it is
doing the right thing, limiting the access in that way.  It is entirely
the client/cache/proxy's responsibility to identify the correct client
to the server.

Ways to "fix" this problem with caching (proxies can be fixed easily,
but as far as I know, the suggested fix hasn't yet been implemented):
1) check with a HEAD request to the server that it can be accessed (this
also serves to check the freshness of the cache...).  Unfortunately, the
semantics of HEAD are bogus, because you can't specify what operation
you actually want to check (e.g. if it's a SEARCH, a GET, or a POST, or
something else...)
2) somebody work out what the Public-Methods header in HTTP should
really mean, so that the cache could just look at this information.
Unfortunately, this is also bogus in its definition: should "public"
mean someone from the same site? someone from a different site? someone
using the same cache...? someone from the same domain as the From header
(as opposed to the client's source address) etc, etc.  Also, it may
actually be hard work for the server to know exactly what methods are
allowed for a particular object: when using forms, you can specify the
method string to use for posting to be anything and this is defined in
the document (bizarrely enough), not the server, and so even assuming
you know what "user" the public bit refers to, it's not certain you can
determine what methods to do...
3) Pragma: no-cache.  However, this seems like extreme overkill.  The
document may well be a lengthy tome with zillions of cute images which
will generally be available to everyone at a particular site, and
accessed often by people on that site.  Disabling caching is just
avoiding the issue and makes things slow.

Personally, I'd go for defining the Public-Methods header to return any
(but *not* neccessarily all) of the methods that a user from the same
site, with no special authentication could use.  For example, accessing
a document might return as a public method "GET" if the server decides
that "nobody@same.site" (see note below), and passing no extra authdata
to the authorisation evaluation routine, could access the document. 
However, the client could still attempt to try a "PUT" or anything else
if it feels like it: if a method is specified in the header, it is
guaranteed to succeed for a "public" client, however the list is not
guaranteed to be complete, other requests should be checked with the
server.

Note: the problem with this is how to determine what the same site *is*
(for example, if they are coming through a proxy server...). The way to
fix this (mentioned previously as how to fix proxy servers) is IMHO to
fix the From header in HTTP to always be trusted (in the absence of any
real authentication data).  Rationale: If I'm not using any *real*
authentication system and just using host based authentication (or
similar), then all I really want is something which I can trust, be it
the address of the client socket, or some data passed through it (esp in
the case of proxies).  If they're lying to me, then that's their fault:
they're the ones who are liable for doing Bad Things, not the server ---
the server is a victim of fraud. So:
(a) the client should always fills in the from field (if nothing else,
with "nobody"@current-domain-name).
(b) proxy servers should always pass the from field through *unchanged*,
unless the information is blank, in which case it should be filled in to
be "nobody"@socket-peer-address. This handles cases where (a) is not
satisfied and even allows requests passing through chains of proxies to
work correctly...
This results in the server always receiving a From header which has the
originating domain name attached to it, or whatever the user placed
there, which would hopefully be something similar.

The above proposals allow for servers to consistently have a piece of
information indicating the source of the request, and further to that,
allows caches to have more correct algorithms to determine if a document
is eligible for caching.

What needs to be done then to get all this working?
(1) Get all proxy servers to ensure that a valid From header is always
passed onto the destination server. 
(2) Allow servers to use host based authentication based on From address
rather than socket-peer address.
(3) Decide what Public-Methods means.
(4) Modify servers to always correctly return the Public-Methods header.
(5) Modify the cache controllers to only cache/serve documents where the
Public-Methods header permits such access (in combination with any other
heuristics being used to decide if a document should be cached, of
course).

So.... how about it? :-)

I did this too, gave a presentation and the audience liked it.  I also
compared HTML with a preformatted gif of some text and imagery.  I have
seen some pretty complicated gifs on welcome pages too (I have seen
Microsoft's server.  It seems to me that it would be possible, but messy,
to effect a kludge whereby the text in the gif was duplicated in a piece of
plain text and indexed.  A successful hit on the index would, prior to
building an html menu of hits for a user, would convert the hit.html to
hit.gif.  This would appear to render gifs searchable, messy, time
consuming but potentially very pretty.

I don't see at all how this would fix the problem.  If it was
accessible last time so it could be cached it will be accessible this
time, too (unless remote config changed).  HEAD is so terribly
inefficient anyway it should be completely buried.

No, the problem is that with the proxy the server sees the proxy IP
and not the client IP.  The solution would be to have the proxy tell
the remote server the client IP address.  Then again, without a secure
protocol the proxy can give whichever address it likes, so this is
very very vulnerable.  You really need a secure protocol before this
works at all.

The problem is not quite as bad as it seems because proxies are
usually local, explicitly protected against use by outside parties, so
IP protection still pretty much works domain-wise, and usually access
control isn't more fine-grained anyway.

The great public fiercely disagrees having their email address
automatically sent -- it's a privacy issue, and I so wouldn't enforce
the From field.

From: "H&kon W Lie" <howcome@dxcern.cern.ch>
content-length: 1475

Judging from the recent disussions in www-talk and at WWW'94 i
Chicago, I think the consenus on style sheets is growing. Several of
the people interested in these topics are not on the high-traffic
www-talk mailing list. I propose moving the discussion to www-html,
which is a smaller list with less activity. (To subscribe to www-talk,
send a message to www-html-request@info.cern.ch with "subscribe
www-html <your real name>" in the body.)

Also, I have created a style sheet page with references to relevant
information. The page is far from complete and contributions are
welcome. See:

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Style/

A brief summary of where we stand

Consensus items:

 o Style sheets should provide a mapping between HTML elements and
   presentation parameters
 o Style sheets provide _hints_ that the browser may or may not take
   into account when rendering documents
 o Both the author and the user should be able to influence the final
   presentation 
 o Style sheets should primarily be referenced from the HTML
   documents, not embedded.

Items for discussion:

 o Should style sheets be HTML-specific or SGML-generic?
 o Can style sheets be blended?
 o Should style sheets include logic?
 o To what extent should the final presentation be predictable?
 o What presentation parameters do we want to control?

Am I wrong? What's missing?

The From: field is a service field used for: 'if you want to contact me
then use this address'. For this reason it _should_ be very easy to change
but at the same time it should not be used for anything else.

OK, yuk. IMG (and FIG) actually serve as useful hints to the
client as to what sort of thing a link is to. That is what I was 
thinking of, although yes of course you are right, in general there is 
no telling what is sensible. If I have a link to a paper abstract in 
html, an d then later a link to the Postscript of the full paper, the 
client cannot know to treat these requests any differently.

Incidentally how should a link be made so that the CERN server multi 
facility is used? Do i link to href="image." and it looks for 
image.gif, image.jpeg etc? I didn't see anything in the CERN 
documentation about this. Perhaps a short tutorial would be handy on 
how to use multi?

Anyway, in the general case, yes perhaps we need an attribute for 
anchor elements that tells the browser precisely what class of object 
it is. Then we need a way for a browser to match up classes of object 
with MIME types read from the mailcaps so it sends appropriate ones. 
Scope there for some hot discussion on what the classes of object are, 
I suspect.

But at the moment (re the other current thread about the online 
newspaper) if a client asks for newspaper.htl with accept text/html and 
image/gif, sending a big gif of the page is not actually wrong. 
Undesirable, but it conforms with what the client said it would accept.

this wouldn't work if going through multiple proxies/caches. E.g. proxy
through a firewall onto a cache somewhere else and finally to the real
server, or using hierachial caching servers. (these examples are
innocent paths; you could also maliciously use this to attempt to get
around host based authentication, bouncing around different proxies.  Or
do it just for the sake of it, like people used to do with the phone

Well yes, but if you really care, you can always do "real"
authentication on the document, if it's that much of a problem.  I'm
just looking at the case where you want the document given out only to a
certain set of sites, without requiring secrecy/confidentiality on the
docs. I am prepared to believe what people tell me: if they are faking
addresses or anything similar to that, then they are the ones who are
liable in legal terms, as they are comitting electronic forgery.

Then they would have "nobody"@current-domain sent to the server, which
reveals nothing (the server could have told that from the peer address)
and things still work fine.  The critical point here is that "From"
field is either (a) set and can be believed if you want to, or (b) it
isn't set and the address "nobody"@client-address refers to the
originating requestor (and not to an intermediate cache or proxy). 

> >From field is much easier forge than peer address, even a newbie could
> do it.

I realise this, but then that user is either lying, in which case they
are committing fraud or something like that, and the server becomes an
unwitting victim or, they're telling the truth and the 'From' field
really does refer to the user, no matter what machine/domain/country
they happen to be at the time, allowing them consistent access to those
loosely protected documents.

I feel I need to emphasise here that I'm not interested in absolute
guaranteed authentication on the originating user: there are very nice
systems for doing that, thankyou.  All I'm interested in is something
which will be correct in all cases unless the user is *deliberately*
lying to me (i.e., it will never be wrong because of the fact that it's
a cache, or a proxy, or some other weird system invented in the future).

I appologize for taking up the bandwidth for something that may be

Would you please explain 

1. What the old internationalization/localization model is, and
2. What the multilingual encoding standard is,  and 
3. How does UNICODE fits into all of this.

Below, I am including a write-up on UNICODE that I found in the Microsoft
Development Libary (the October '94 issue). I would very much like to understand
what the issues are. Thanks for taking your time to explain it.


>Richard Goerwitz

		Best regards,
		Vladimir.

Since code pages are different for each script and operating environment, attempts to 
standardize and consolidate all code pages onto one code page are now underway. One 
standard is called Unicode, an effort driven by Apple, Borland, Digital, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lotus, Metaphor, Microsoft, Next, Novell,  Research Libraries 
Group, Sun, WordPerfect, and Xerox. 

Unicode is a pure 16-bit character encoding that encompasses all characters used in 
general text interchange. The two volume standard is available from Addison Wesley as 
The Unicode Standard; Worldwide Character Encoding Volume I and The Unicode Standard; 
Worldwide Character Encoding Volume 2 (ISBN 0-201-56788-1 and ISBN 0-201-60845-6 
respectively).

The ISO DIS (Draft Industrial Standard) 10646.2 was merged with Unicode version 1.0 to 
form Unicode's current version, 1.1.

Differences between Unicode and Existing Code Pages

The main differences between Unicode and existing code pages are as follows:

	All characters are 16 bits wide. Unlike DBCS there are no lead bytes. Random 
access to character strings is also possible and programs generally dont need to 
maintain state information when parsing strings.

	A Unicode index refers unequivocally to a given character; for example, the 
symbol happy face and the control code Ctrl-A are two different characters in Unicode.

	Unicode is a character encoding. Ligatures are not characters, but glyphs. Text 
in Unicode is always in character form. Only in final output stage does an application 
or graphics engine combine f and i and substitute the glyph for the fi ligature.

	There are non-spacing accents in Unicode that can be combined with base 
characters to create composite letters.
Unicode provides mappings to and from all the important single-byte code pages in use on 
computers today.

Unicode Goals

The following are the basic goals of Unicode:

	Eliminate special-case Systems and Applications code for multiple character 
sets, thus speeding up localization and reducing testing time.

	Make a larger range of characters available than will fit in a single-byte code 
page.

	Ensure that character code is independent of compression and text formatting 
considerations.

	Make code more efficient when used as an internal processing code.

	Ensure that Unicode is complete when used as data interchange or reference code.

Unicode provides a model that has much of the simplicity and efficiency of the 
plain-text model, but with greater international capabilities. Microsoft is supporting 
Unicode in the 32-bit API for Windows (Win32 API), and several other companies are 
working on Unicode implementation.

Unicode is a Character Encoding

Unlike DBCS, Unicode is not a variable-length encoding. Text in Unicode cannot be passed 
to functions that are expecting zero-terminated ASCII strings. The first 256 characters 
in Unicode have the same layout as the international standard ISO 8859/1. However, 
Unicode is zero-extended to 16-bits. The terminator in a Unicode string is 0x0000 
because many Unicode characters contain one null byte.

ISO 8859/1 was used as the source for the Windows ANSI character set. Except for the 80H 
through 9FH range, which is the C1 control-code range, there is a one-to-one 
correspondence between Windows ANSI and Unicode. The few additional characters defined 
in the Windows ANSI set in this range have corresponding characters elsewhere in 
Unicode.

Volume 1 of the Unicode 1.0 standard was published in the fall of 1991. This volume 
contains assigned codes for every major alphabet and symbol in the world except for the 
Han characters of the Korean, Chinese, and Japanese writing systems. Volume 2, 
containing a unified Han character set, became available in early 1992.

Correct; in general, there are only two different kinds of requests:
inline images and everything else.

There is such a provision suggested in HTML 3.0; the "type" parameter
of anchors suggests what the content-type of the object referenced, but
it's advisory only and non-authoritative.  The client should not use it to
tailor the Accept: fields it sends.

This is a function of content-type negotiation; it is generally
not possible to losslessly convert HTML to GIF.  But, yes, the spec allows
the server to decide, based on the information given to it by the client,
whatever content-type it considers most appropriate.  That's the point.
Are you saying the spec should prohibit this?

This is a long posting, aimed at answering the following questions

What has frustrated the university community for some time now is
that we've had to purchase special-purpose software to do our work.
This is because software firms - typically US based - tend to think
of their customer base in terms of local markets.  So, if you want
to write a document in Arabic, you first of all have to get the
Arabic version of the operating system and GUI you want to run, then
get Arabic versions of the software you need.

These are so-called "localized" products.  Ironically, the term in-
ternationalization refers to the process of storing various locale-
specific information as separate resources, so that a given package
can be recompiled easily for a new local environment.

What's wrong with this method?  Nothing.  It's just that it's not
a complete solution.  Imagine an international firm like Caterpil-
lar, which despite a strike in the US, is making big money - espe-
cially in overseas markets.  In Europe the EEC requires that every
document they produce be made available in all of their members'
languages simultaneously.  To do this, Cat has a big MT effort on
now.  But wouldn't it be nice if they could also pass their docu-
ments freely - in any language - from one branch to the next, with-
out having conversion problems caused by differently localized soft-
ware packages?

Consider another case.  What about an academician writing a commentary
in German on the book of Genesis.  He must quote his fellow scholars
in French, English, etc.  And he must quote his text as well (in
Hebrew).  It is also likely that he will need to quote ancient trans-
lations like the Septuagint (Greek), Targum (Aramaic), and Vulgate
(Latin).  This sort of thing is common in linguistics and philology.
Thus far, American word processors have, by and large, ignored the
possibility that someone might actually want to use more than one
language at a time.  Wouldn't it be nice for philologists and ling-
uists if they could?  Would it be nice for *any* humanities scholar
that has to deal with original sources in languages other than his
native one (that's a lot of scholars)?

Consider yet another case.  In India there are, I think, six official
scripts.  They use English for scholarship and many official functions,
but are also required to document things in the local language as well.
Languages are also freely mixed in many contexts.  Note also that Urdu
uses Arabic script.  So here we are with six different scripts, incl.
a Latin-based on and one that goes right-left - and we may need to
mix them in documents.  Is a system geared only for localization go-
ing to work?  No.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a system that allowed
us to move freely in and out of each language?  Similar problems, BTW,
are encountered in Canada (French-English), Singapore (Chinese-Arabic,
plus various languages of India, English, and local languages), and
in many other places.

To accommodate all of these languages requires a lot of codepage switch-
ing - OR a single 16-bit standard large enough to encompass all of the
world's major scripts.  Unicode is supposed to be that standard.

I hope that this explanation is helpful.  It's non-technical because I
tend to think of these problems in non-technical ways, due to my train-
ing and background.  Any errors you find are my fault alone.

Agreed. I hoped that was obvious. I deliberately picked an example of 
an undesirable (and curently topical) conversion which, currently, the 
clients seem to be saying they would accept.

I was arguing for putting information into the link that aided this 
process, so the client could give it better information to perform this 
content type negotiation than simply all possible things the client 
could ever accept; such as, what it might like for the current request. 

For example, a link could be tagged as belonging to a class of 
documents that are text searchable. So the client might send an Accept 
of text/html, text/plain, application/x-pdf and anything else that the 
users' mailcap indicates that has contiguous searchable text strings in 
it. image/gif, for example, would not fall into that category, neither 
would, say, application/postscript.

> That's the point.

Sure

> Are you saying the spec should prohibit this?

No. I am saying that the process should be made easier so it actually 
gets used. In particular, I would like, for example, HTML 3 browsers to 
be able to say they can accept html 3. I would like to reduce the risk 
of clearly undesirable conversions such as the example I gave.

[proposal deleted]

Nick - 
  I may be missing the point here, but I can't quite understand the
purpose of this scheme. It doesn't really provide any protection for
the documents, and because it requires both parties to explicitly
trust *all* the intermediaries, can't easily be modified to become
part of a secure framework. 

If the aim is to discourage unauthorised users from accessing the resources, 
would it be easier to have an explicit licencing agreement appearing on all 
published entry points to the server?

Cacheing and security are somewhat antagonistic. There are several
ways of dealing with the problem. If the proxy is trusted by the
server, it can authenticate the user itself; this would be the case if
both servers were part of the same adminstrative domain. Otherwise,
the document could be cached on the server in encrypted form, and the
key obtained from the originating server in response to a relayed
request from the client. The document key would have to be encrypted
using the clients public key to prevent the proxy from decoding the document.

I am a bit reluctant to condict a discussion of this on www-talk as it
may become divergent. However, I have a WWW-centric reason for wanting 
to support Win95:

My goal in developing the Windows Web server was to put the capability
to provide content to the web into the hands of the hordes of PC users
who are joining the internet. It might argued that this is not a "good
thing" as there will be a lot of junk. Well, maybe, but there'll be a 
lot of good stuff in there, and like the "ransom note syndrome" that swept
the ranks of Mac users in the early days, the junk will eventually die
out.

Windows 95 will be the next personal operating system for PCs. The user
interface has undergone a total facelift, TCP/IP is built in, etc. From
a USER's perspective, Win95 is infinitely better than NT. From a SYSTEM
perspective, I heartily agree that NT is a wonderful, robust, thoroughly
modern operating system. However, Win95 has a rock-hard goal of running
on a 4MB 386, and has the UI features that will make it extremely attrac-
tive to the average user.

Bottom line: By supporting Win95, I further my goal of putting Web server
capability into the hands of the masses. Nothing in my opinion can go as
far as that to balance the "content provider" mentality of the telcos and
the media moguls. Not that I want to prevent them from doing their thing,
I just want to make sure the average joe/jane can participate in the
networked society.

Let's not start a thread about Win95 vs NT here.

There is an increasing number of people and programs who are trying to
figure out the best ways of making the WWW accessible to people with low
vision and those who are blind.  As a result, the Trace Center is getting
increasing requests from people and organizations for information on what is
the best mechanism or what would be most appropriate for users who are
blind.  In order to provide them with better opportunities to get first-hand
input, we would like to identify individuals who are using the World Wide
Web who have low vision or who are blind, and who are interested in
communicating with these people and programs and offering opinions about
strategies for making browsers and other WWW tools more accessible to people
with visual impairments.  We are also interested in identifying individuals
who are interested in helping us in our research here at the Trace Center in
making next-generation information systems in general more accessible to
people with low vision or blindness.  

If you are such a WWW user (Mosaic, Lynx, etc.) and are interested in having
your name shared with researchers and developers in this area, please send
your name in a message to 

curbcuts@trace.wisc.edu

Please note in your message that you are interested in having your name
added to the listing of WWW users who are blind or have low vision, and
indicate whether you would like to be listed as a consumer/user with low
vision or with blindness.  

If you do not want to provide your name for one of these resource lists, but
you would like to follow what's going on, you can also send a message to

The conclusion that style sheets are required for HTML/Web growth
does seem to be reaching consenus.  The conclusion that HTML2.0 
or HTML3.0 (as proposed) is an adequate means to represent web 
information has not.

The people I talked with in Chicago, mostly SGML types, expressed
deep concern that either HTML was going to:
	- get mutated to the point that it can not serve any needs well, 
	- or that several existing, real, and current information 
  	  encoding needs would not be met. 
Either way, the web would continue to fragment and lose its 
inter-operability.

I believe that expressions of this concern are C.M. Sperberg-McQueen's 
presentation, "HTML to the Max: SGML Intelligence to the World Wide Web"
and Jon Bosak's proposal. (available from
	ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/davenport/HDL/hdl.proposal.html and
	ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/davenport/HDL/hdl.q-and-a.html)

One problem of the current approach is how are you going to present 
to author or reader something meaningful to help them adjust the 
presentation style? 

For example, our large authoring DTDs have over eight separate things 
that end up as italic. It would do no one any good to simply say 
	"make all italics 14pt bold". 
Whereas, it would help them to say 
	"make program variables bold".

Read Jon Udell article in November 1994 BYTE magazine titled
Exploring Chicago and Daytona.  You may reconsider your view
on Win95 as "... a rock-hard goal of running on a 4MB 386".
At this point Win95 is still a moving target for developing on.

In general, I think that the more platforms you support with
your server the better the average joe/jane can participate in the
networked society (and your bank account will reflect that too -).

        Careful, Chris.   We have feelings too.

        There's no reason why  ASCII-EBCDIC  isn't  100%  reversible.

        Here,  try

                http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~troth/ebcdic_is_okay

        [excuse my use of tilde;  I trust no gateway mangled it]

        The code point assignments are different.   That's all.
As far as I'm concerned it's just a strange mapping of ISO 8859-1.

Would it be correct to say that the earliest idea of the WWW was to
offer a single consistent user interface to different network
services, rather than a world wide hypertext system?

This question appears to confuse servers and browsers.  A single user
interface is, by definition, a browser, whilst a world wide hypertext
system, although not necessarily a server, is definitely not a browser.  If
you look at the original www browser it does *not* fit the bill for a multi
purpose browser.

Tim Berners-Lee is interviewed about the origins and future of the web in
the October issue of "Internet World".  This article may also be available
electronically but I cannot say where.  He comments in this article that he
"... would like a single user interface for all of these things [usenet,
e-mail and the web] ..." which would seem to suggest that the original
intention was a distributed hypertext system.

Hi www-talk folks,

A consortium comprised of The Center for High Performance Computing of WPI,
Digital Learning Services of DEC, AimTech, and The Consortium On Financing
Higher Education has been awarded an ARPA TRP contract as part of the
Interoperability Testbeds for the NII.

Under this contract we will do the following:

1. Extend AimTech's authoring products to deliver computer based training
applications over the internet.  We will build on top of existing www standards
and explore if there is a need for further standards.
2. Build and host sample computer based training applications as a proof of
concept.
3. Specify a rich linking method that will allow educators and students to
peruse computer based training modules.
4. Specify a rich linking method that will allow for an automated negotiation
of payment terms for the use of computer based training modules.

We would like to find people that are interested in helping us on the following:

1. Test the software by developing sample training or educational modules.
2. Represent corporate training, higher education, and K-12 organizations
   that would like to investigate this technology
3. Work with us to define rich linking methods

Thanks, Leo.

I gather that TimBL believed that hypertext _is_ an single consistent
user interface to different network services:

From: WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a HyperText Project
at: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proposal.html

WorldWideWeb:

Proposal for a HyperText Project 
T. Berners-Lee / CN, R. Cailliau / ECP 

Abstract:

HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of
nodes in which the user can browse at will. Potentially, HyperText provides a
single user-interface to many large classes of stored information such as
reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line systems help. We
propose the implementation of a simple scheme to incorporate several different
servers of machine-stored information already available at CERN, including an
analysis of the requirements for information access needs by experiments. 
---

see also: "WWW Project History"
at http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/History.html

The WWW project is _very_ well documented on info.cern.ch. It's fairly ironic
that most WWW users get their info from NCSA's whats-new and FAQ documents,
and never get the background info from info.cern.ch. They end up asking
historical and architectural questions on www-talk or comp.infosystems....
that would be easily answered with 5 minutes surfing around info.cern.ch.

Oh... and do dispell a popular myth: the CERN LineMode browser is
_not_ the original WWW client. The original WWW client was a WYWIWYG
HTML editor and multi-window browser that TimBL wrote for the
NeXTStep environment. I thought it was kinda funny when somebody asked
on comp.infosystems.www.* "Is there a WWW client for the NeXT?"

          I have a question.  My school wants to purchase a unix

          am ionterseted to know what the general consensus about
          which flavor of UNIX (UnixWare,SunOS,etc) would be best to
          run in terms of Stability/support/ease of use and secondly
          raw processing speed and power.  Keep in mind those things
          because this is a high school, and even if I do happen to
          nknow a lot about computers,I'm only 15, and don't have time
          in my day to call tech support every 45 minutes and ask them
          questions.  There is no set price range (problably an upper
          limit of about 7000).

I was reading the article "World Wide Web & HTML" in Dr. Dobbs today
(#224 December 1994, pg. 18) by Douglas C. McArthur.

First, let me say that I really enjoyed the article.  The following
discussion is actually something I've been thinking about posting here
for a while.  Seeing it in print has only shown me that now is the time
to discuss it.

Anyway, Douglas wrote about forms (pg. 24):
    Do not forget the attribute METHOD=POST, since use of METHOD=GET, the
    default attribute, should be avoided, especially if a large amount of
    data could potentially be submitted using the form.

The part about not using METHOD=GET if there is a large amount of data is
true but there is more to the story.  The problem is that POST'ed forms
cannot be stuffed into hypertext links (!) making it a real pain to store
queries and the like.  There is an alarming trend towards using METHOD=POST
where GET would be more appropriate.  Also, decoding programs should allow
for either format.  I've been seeing more and more systems that only accept
METHOD=POST, even on forms where METHOD=GET should really be used.

It is tremendously important that, in general, requests be storable in a
URL or else the WWW model will begin to break down.  Users must be careful
in the way they use METHOD=POST and perhaps the whole issue needs to be
carefully re-examined.  Or perhaps there needs to be an extended encoding
for form data in HTTP URLs such that POST'ed forms could be stored more
easily.

Daniel,

I think your question may be off the topic, but here's an answer anyway...
I'd recommend looking at a Macintosh solution versus a UNIX machine for
usability and ease of setup/maintenance reasons.  You can set up a WWW server
on a Mac running the standard Macintosh operating system, and your school can
probably get a pretty swinging deal on a suitable model, if they don't have
one already.  If UNIX is really the requirement, Apple does make models
running AUX, which is their UNIX flavor, but unless the school has access to
a machine so equipped, I wouldn't recommend it, as Apple is "deemphasizing"
this product.

Using the Mac will help ensure that whoever inherits the care and feeding of
the system after you move on will have a much easier job than if you go with
something in the UNIX world.

Just MHO (my humble opinion)...

As a person who is putting donated/used Unix boxes in schools
as a part of our outreach program, I would say:

	Get a Unix that has a reasonably large following near you
	so you can ask questions of people who you know.

We use SunOS for our Computer Science Outreach Services systems.
It makes many software installs easy, because most things are 
being written for SunOs still. This will slow down over time
as more and more people start using solaris. 

But for our Public schools, we are giving HP 300's with NetBSD.
This is because:

	1) we can give them source
	2) We can fix it if we have to
	3) We can switch the hardware from a Hp 300 to a 386 to a sparc
		without changing the OS.
	4) it is free
	5) it is a BSD.

I suggest you find a local support group and see who else is around
who can help you when you get stuck.

   The issue also rests on WWW browser developers.  Several browsers
can not handle URL's longer the xxx characters nor documents with more
than yyy number of embedded widgets.  Further, I prefer having the option 
of both methods being available to suit different application needs.

Subject: simple example of how to retrieve raw HTML using libwww
content-length: 834


Hello Good People,

Am I the only one who finds the documentation on the CERN libwww
library less than useful? I am having a great deal of trouble figuring
out how to do something which should be very simple.

I want to use libwww to compose a request for a URL, and have it fill
buffer which contains the raw contents of the document (or image or
whatever). I also want to be able to examine the information returned
in the response header, about content length, location, etc, which I
presume will be neatly stored in the HTRequest structure.

Can anyone point me at a simple piece of source code that does what I
want?  And please don't tell me to look at the CERN LineMode browser;
I have and it is really quite difficult for me to understand. There
must be a twenty line program that does what I want already?? 

Thanks,
	Henry

I am glad for your interest in the Common Code Library! However, I
think that you critic is a bit unfair - but I must admit - not
completely untrue!

Have you looked at the paper about the library written for the Chicago
conference? This is supposed to give you an overview of the
capabilities of the library. This is available from

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html

We try to keep the overview documentation separate on our info server
but the detailes are written in the html files in the source code
directory. At compile time they are converted into h files, and hence
we are guaranteed consistency between the detailed documentation and
the source code itself. This information is available from

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Implementation.html

Here you find a quite detailed description of the functions you should
use in order to do what you want (look into the HTAccess.html module)

The Library evolves all the time and so does the documentation - we are
always happy to get feedback from you at

	libwww@info.cern.ch

I'm not sure I'm getting your point here. I know the difference
between servers and browsers, and I wasn't really talking about
either. 

I was wondering about the original idea behind the internet service
WWW.

OK. I've seen some references that this was the idea behind WWW, is
all. 

Thanx for the reference.

We use BSD/I running on 486 machines - initially because it was cheap, but
I've been really impressed with it. It'll run on a 386, on our 486/50s we
can run X with no trouble, as well as an httpd, and seem to get about
SPARC-2 performance. Compared with the same machines under Widows, it's
amazing. Runtime version costs about GBP 400, a CDROM with all the sources
is about GBP1000

Look at http://www.bsdi.com/

Just a satisfied customer.

Okay, I am also with a K12 organization that has set up a few UNIX 
servers and we really like the 'LINUX' system.  There is software that 
Installs itself off of a DOS partition with stuff called Slackware.  Then 
the manuals go basically down the list: install mail, install news, 
install SLIP ect.....  Most of the work at our school is also done by 
students who don't have the time, we control most of the network in the 
building (Includeing manageing mail and writeing W3 script).  I can 
contact you with people that may have more to say, e-me.

In terms of support, the Linux Usenet groups are terrific,
comp.ps.linux.*

Of course, *any* unix version is going to make demands on someone's

I think the guiding principle here is that GET must be idempotent.
That is, when you use GET,

	You don't change anything in thw webor anywhere else
	You don't commit yourself to anything (except cost of access)
	You always get the same logical resulf for the same URL

These are really useful design criteria which allow one to
make important deductions.  As an arbitrary example, you can

	Cache the result of a GET
	Preemtively look-up the result of a GET on behalf of someone

I said logical above because things like "the state of the coffee  
pot" is a time-dependent thing though always logically the same.

So if the function returned by the form, such as
"A critique of the syntax of (xxx) as anHTML document"
can be regarded as an idempotent function, which it can,
then GET is appropriate.

[[There is a snag when the parameters (like an HTML document
as a litteral string) get too big to hold in a URL.
But then, it is not so obvious that you want the same
things to happen to it anyway (caching, saving in
hotlists). We wouldn't want someone saving the results
of an analysis of 200MB of astrophysics to a hotlist
to be storing the 200MB away, for example.]]

If however the function has side-effects, like
"the result of my ordering a pizza with pepperoni",
then it should *not* use get, as clearly screwups could
occur. For example, suppose the pizza hut returns a 

useful calendar and menu acknowledging each order, and you put
one in your hotlist.  And every day your client refreshes
cached copies of everything in your hotlist... this
could affect your health. 


POST is appropriate here.

Hi

The biggest problem we have with this GET vs POST method is the 
continuing bug in Mosaic for MS-Windows which trashes POSTed 
information if the server is asking for authentication. Until this
is fixed, we have to use GET. ;-(

Having said that, we are in real danger of dropping Mosaic in favour
of Netscape, as there are other forms bugs which we are feeling.
( Anyone noticed a GET request with TWO question marks in it ? )

content-length: 886

Harvest is an integrated set of tools to gather, extract, organize, search,
cache, and replicate relevant information across the Internet.  With modest
effort users can tailor Harvest to digest information in many different
formats, and offer custom search services on the Internet.  Moreover,
Harvest makes very efficient use of network traffic, remote servers, and
disk space.

We have built a number of content indexes with Harvest, including an
index of AT&T's 1-800 phone numbers, an index of WWW home pages, and an
index of over 24,000 Computer Science technical reports from around the
world.

We have been beta testing Harvest for four months, and starting today
are making the software available on the Internet.  You can get to 
demonstrations, papers, software and documentation at

        I wish that client authors would use different logic for file:
and ftp: type URLs.   Some (most? all? the library?) are using the same
logic for both of these.   It's a shame.   Intuitively,

                ftp://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/path/path/file

        works for both Anonymous FTP and non-Anonymous FTP,  and

                file:/path/path/file

        refers to a locally resident object.

        Then we don't need an explicit  anon-ftp:  URL type.

The HTML Validation Service has become quite a success. Many folks
have been asking if they can validate documents at their own site.

There are lots of posts on comp.text.sgml asking how to set up
and use the SGMLs parser and the HTML DTD.

Following the easy installation model of the WebMaster's Starter
Kit, Dan Connolly and I have assembled:

	The HTML Check Toolkit
	http://www.hal.com/~markg/HaLSoft/html-check/

We're currently only supporting SunOS 4.1.3, but we should have
sgmls binaries for other platforms available soon (linux and solaris
are on the immediate to-do list).

The toolkit should take just a few minutes to install.

Then you can just:

   % html-check test/*
   test/bad.html ...
   sgmls: SGML error at test/bad.html, line 10 at ":":
          Incorrect character in markup; markup terminated
   sgmls: SGML error at test/bad.html, line 10 at "p":
          Length of name, number, or token exceeded NAMELEN or LITLEN limit
   sgmls: SGML error at test/bad.html, line 10 at ":":

   sgmls: SGML error at test/bad.html, line 14 at ">":

   sgmls: SGML error at test/bad.html, line 14 at ">":
          B end-tag ignored: doesn't end any open element (current is P)
   test/good.html ...
   ... valid

Documentation on how to read these error messages is also something
we're thinking about developing.

Let us know if you like it! And certainly let us know if you have
sgmls binaries for other platforms or other things to contribute.

        This is useful, but must *not* be a requirement.  In other words,
let the sender say "here comes xxx bytes" as if to ask "can you take it?"
and let the receiver reject the file if it cannot take it.

        As an LPR client author,  I cannot express my frustration over
Berkeley LPD's insistence on an exact byte count ahead of time.   The
alternative,  of course,  is some kind of  "packet"  scheme.   Certainly
any object to be send could be program output,  which size is uknown
before the transfer starts.

The Library of Common Code supports format of an FTP URL indicated
above, but it is not generally recommended to put a `private' userid
and passwd in the URI - dummy ones as ftp:wwwaccess are ok.

For file URLs, it does try ftp as a last resort. However, I have in the
last two releases pointed out that this will be disabled in the next
major release as it causes very long timeouts if a non-existent local
file is requested.

Low level page layout (GIF, JPEG, PDF, ...) is a tempting short term
solution for control over presentation, but is much too limiting for
the longer term.

    o   How do you maintain control over presentation when
        the end machine has limited resources, e.g. fonts,
        resolution, colors and window size?

    o   How do you support dynamic layout effectively?
        Rule-based style sheets allow information providers rich
        control over appearance for a wide range of window sizes.

    o   How do you accomodate to user preferences, particularly
        for changes needed by people with visual impairments?

The World Wide Web Organization is working to develop rich style
sheet mechanisms that tackles each of these issues and can also be
used for arbitrary SGML document formats, not just HTML.

Very interesting statement about a general SGML style sheet.  What
is the relationship between it and DSSSL?  Is it a sub-set? Do you
have a document for the current state of the style sheet definition?

What Dave is talking about is surely not a subset of DSSSL. I am
currently writing up a list of stylesheet requirements, and I am also
looking at DSSSL, SDL, HDL, and the other extent stylesheet proposals
to see which might be better for the WWW. I will have an anaylsis of
stylesheet needs (and perhaps a proposal) out within the next week. I
personally feel that the stylesheet issue is far from resolved, and
therefore feel it premature to even start an implementation. In
addition, I believe that SGML Open has also noted that this is an
important inssue, and they will begin discussion on the issue this
week. 

BTW. I often wonder why we must limit ourselves to stylesheets for
SGML/HTML... but my analysis will reveal more on this.

This was recently fixed and will be in the next release.  Sorry about the

   True, yet the intended functionality seems to drive the use.  Hotlists
   and caching seem quite useful for un/parameterized IR tasks but not 
   interactive tasks.  Analysis of 200MB of data might better off if treated 
   differently than 200MB of paramterized IR query.  Similiarly, semi-statefull
   connections seem quite applicable to interactive, but not IR tasks.  So,
   how does paramterized IR differ from interactive - by the existence of
   successive state transistions.  Most paramterized IR tasks comprise a
   single state, whereas interactive tasks usually require that the results
   from one state be known in future states.

   The notion of client refreshes of hotlist items is worrisome wrt POST.
   The software performing the refresh has no way of knowing that the 
   URL resulted from a POST or is just a static document.

   For example, when I attempt to retrieve a document that initiated via
   a POST request, many forms I tried produce errors or undesired results.
   Can POST really be cached or added to a hotlist correctly?

You should not have POST items in a hotlist. How could you put them in?

No. That is the point. Things which should not be in a hotlist use a method 
other than GET, so they can't be put in a hot list. That is, I believe, what 
TimBL was saying.

Subject: Changes in ListProcessor
content-length: 2860

Some people have found difficulties unsubscribing from
a mailing list, or changing their email address. To improve the quality
of this service, we changed some rules, thanks to your comments.

An X-Comment line has been added to summarize how to sign off a list.

I will describe only the functions that have been modified. You
can get the complete documentation by sending mail to
listproc@info.cern.ch with the body:
HELP

subscribe <mailing-list> [-e email] [-p password] <your name>
-------------------------------------------------------------
Will subscribe you to a list. The -e option allows you to 
select another email to receive messages than the one
you are sending your email from. The -p option
allows you to use a password.

Example:
    subscribe www-proxy -e zorro@horse.org Zorro
    subscribe www-talk -p Barbara Bill C.

As this modified version of ListProcessor allows very easy
unsubscriptions, you may wish to use a password.
I think the use of the password will be better explained 
in a table:

Let us suppose you want to remove your entry A from
a mailing list, and you're sending your email from 
an address B

                        +-------------+---------------+
                        | No password | Password      |
+-----------------------+-------------+---------------+
| A and B are different | A removed   | A not removed |
+-----------------------+-------------+---------------+
| A is the same as B    | A removed   | A removed     |
+-----------------------+-------------+---------------+

Note that in any case a warning message will be sent to A and B.


PASSWORD <mailing-list> [-e email] [-p previous_password] <-n new_password>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to set a password later.
  examples:
    PASSWORD www-talk -n BIGBARBE
    PASSWORD www-html -e barbiche@info.cern.ch -p BARBICHE -n BIGBARBE


UNSUBSCRIBE <mailing-list> [-e email] [-p password]
---------------------------------------------------
To unsubscribe!

  examples:
    UNSUBSCRIBE WWW-TALK -e zoulou@info.cern.ch -p ZOUZOU


REVIEW <mailing-list>
RECIPIENTS <mailing-list>
-------------------------
If you don't know under which email you are subscribed, this will
give you the list of all subscribers to this mailing-list that are 
not concealed. To get concealed, the command is 
"set <mailing-list> conceal yes".


CHANGE <mailing-list> [-e previous_email] <-n new-email> [-p password]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To change the mail under which you are subscribed.

  examples:
    CHANGE WWW-TALK -e barbiche@info.cern.ch -n bigbarbe@info.cern.ch -p BARB
    CHANGE WWW-ANNOUNCE -n zoulou@www.info.cern.ch
(In the last example, the program will take your email from your mail 
headers)

Thank you,

There are several texts which are in the publication process, due out 
arount January or so.  I don't have the titles/publishers handy, and, 
since they are not available yet, don't think you would necessarily 
benefit from the information.   But, if you simply _must_ have it, please 
email me directly, and I will attempt to track them down.

I am currently developing a course to teach HTML (in conjunction with 
Cogent Technology Training: cogent@halcyon.com).  I have found that 
several of the hypertext primers are useful (albeit not nearly AS useful) 
if printed out.  You need a WWW browser to get at the information in the 
first place, as far as I know, but once it is in the browser, you could 
print it out.  Both of primers below have a lot of valuable material in a 
few large files.

Perhaps servers should return a indication of what area is
covered by the authentication.  For example:

Client:
	GET /protected/recipies/secret-sauce/ingredients HTML/1.0
	...
Server:
	401 Unauthorized
	WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="burgers_and_fries"
	WWW-Realm-Partial: /protected/recipies/, /protected/foods/
	...
Client:
	GET /protected/recipies/secret-sauce/ingredients HTML/1.0
	Authorization: Basic mickeyd:passwd
	...

And now the client knows that it is ok to send the username/password on
an access to /protected/recipies/fries or /protected/foods/fries but that
should the user select something in /protected/payroll/* then it would
*not* send the users password to that area because they would probably
generate a security warning being issued.

Does this make sense?

In a way, yes. But truly anal security fiends would say that this is
divulging potentially sensitive information. They get nervous when you
tell folks the difference between "file not found" and "unauthorized".
It's kinda like having a unix loging program that goes:

	login: fred
	username OK... passwd: ****

	login: fredd
	username no good.

	login:

As long as you're using the basic authentication scheme, you're certainly
not in the league of anal security fiends, and this may be OK.

   One of the points made earlier was that caching/hotlisting heavily 
paramterized GET commands can be undesireable - i.e. they tend to bump the 
file sizes of hotlists, global histories, etc.  I'm glad that you also 
agree that hotlisting POSTs is worrisome - though, they are doable - just
store the data blob along with the URL in a structured format. Still, the
loci on control determining allowance of this ought to ultimately rest with 
the user.

   Conclusions from discussions:

     use GET for logical independant tasks/retrieval

     currently POSTs should not be hotlisted/cached, though this is doable

     session-based transactions suit interactive tasks whereas stateless 
	transactions suit most paramterized IR tasks

   Any others?

Jim.

This makes great sense.  Right now browsers (we're hoping!) resend names
and passwords for every access to the same machine and port.  Obviously
for some other situations this is less than ideal. I'd also like to see
the ability to put other machines and ports in the WWW-Realm-Partial line
- for example, it'd be great if we could set up the HotWired system such
that instead of one monolithic server (actually two) doing duty as
www.hotwired.com, we could set up separate servers for separate content
areas or functions, with the user just entering their name and password
*once*.  I.e. 

WWW-Realm: /, kino.hotwired.com, staffweb.hotwired.com:8000/Staff/

I don't see any security problems with declaring another host as a member 
of a realm, as long as it's not reversible.  I.e., let's say my server
gives:

WWW-Realm: /, www.nsa.gov

A given user comes here, enters a name and password, and follows a link to
www.nsa.gov.  The client enters the cached name and password there, which
fails. They then enter a name and password that succeeds.  If they come
back to my machine, the client should *not* send the cached name and
password from www.nsa.gov, even if www.nsa.gov didn't specify a realm - 
if it did so, I could get that user's valid name and password to 
www.nsa.gov if I wished, which would be bad.

Good call!  Let's get it in HTTP 2.0....

Well... extending the CGI bin scripts to allow ';' in addition
to '&' as a parameter separator is a pretty much upward compatible
change.

It's fine for URLs computed by HTTP clients like Mosaic to go
right on using

	http://foo/bar?x=y&a=b

but any such URLs actually place in the text of an HTML document
would be changed to:

	href="http://foo/bar?x=y;a=b" since existing browsers don't grok
		http="http://foo/bar?x=y&#38;a=b"

And CGI-bin scripts would be enhanced to allow '&' or ';'. The
only possible problem is if a form value had a ';' character in it, like:

	http://foo/bar?x=a;b&z=123

I doubt that happens very much, and there's a good chance that browsers
already %xx-ify these things. If so, then the only remaining nasty
is coding these in documents. It would look like

	href="http://foo/bar?x=a%3Bb;z=123"

>	Is it at all possible for the DTD to be "fixed"? 

Well, this is something that's not specified by the HTML DTD, but
rather by SGML itself. So no, it can't be fixed.

The problem is that folks have been lazily slinging strings around
in various context without taking encoding considerations into
account.

For example, to encode an arbitrary string as a form value in an href
attribute, you must go through the following steps:

	1. Encode the string as a URL "word" by replacing all occurences
	of "reserved" characters ':', '/', '?', etc. and whitespace
	by %xx equivalents.

	2. Encode the resulting string as an SGML attribute value
	literal by replacing all occurences of '&', '\'', '"', '\n',
	'\r' by &#ddd; equivalents.

	3. write "http://host/path?name=_resulting_string_"

But current browsers don't implement the reverse of step 2 correctly,
and I understand there was considerable difficulty getting CGI
implementations to handle the reverse of step 1 consistently.

For example, if you write:

	<img src="eq1.gif" alt="a > b">

you'll be surpised to find that the > in a > b is interpreted as
the end of the IMG tag, in some browsers. And you'll be further
disappointed that you can't work around this bug by writing:

	<img src="eq1.gif" alt="a &#62; b">

Regarding:

>I want Dan's %7E to go away too  (as in tilde being
>okay per spec)  and I'm not alone.   But ...

There's nothing wrong with using 

	http://www.hal.com/~connolly

in most contexts. There are no nasty interactions with HTML or HTTP.
But if you try to mail that through some BITNET or JANET sites, you'll
get gibberish on the other end. There's a limited "mail safe"
character set documented somewhere in the RFC's.

And the URL spec, for some dubious reason, says that URLs should be
written in a "transport friendly" way, i.e. in a way that they don't
have to be scanned and escaped for various protocols. That is, rather
than using base64 or quoted-printable or some other mechanism specially
desinged to deal with the brokenness in the internet mail world,
the URL syntax should provide a way to escape the characters so that
these interactions are prevented. Hence ~ is supposed to be written
%7E for maximum transport friendliness.

This is a silly thing to do, since it impossible to be certain that
_any_ URL syntax has no interaction with all surrounding syntaxes.
This '&' interaction is a perfect case in point: the '&' character
cannot be %xx escaped, because that changes its meaning from "form
parameter separator" to "form value constiuent character." This
business of %xx-ifying the "unsafe" characters doesn't work in the
case that a character is both "reserved" and "unsafe."


In summary: each layer of encoding should be handled carefully, but
independently. The URL syntax should not attempt to address internet
mail brokennes (I should use base64 or quoted-printable if I'm really
worried about ~ not making it through the mail), and HTTP clients
should not gloss over SGML attribute value literal syntax when parsing
URLs in href attributes.

If you check the access logs on www.wired.com you'll note that I wrote
my letter to www-talk about 10 minutes after signing up :-)

Yes, that means I only thought about this for about 10 minutes before
spouting off but it seemed pretty obvious that what was needed was some
way to tell the client what was going on and since URLs are supposed
to be hierarchical I figured this was a done deal, just tell them.

Another feature is that this doesn't impact existing clients at all,
it's just hints to help make things a little bit smarter.  Totally
optional on both ends.

Yes I agree, however, it should be an arbirary URI, so let's
call it WWW-Realm-URI:

> I don't see any security problems with declaring another host as a member
> WWW-Realm: /, www.nsa.gov
As Dan pointed out, you are telling hackers about other systems and paths
on your server which some people might not want to do; but as a famous
doctor once said, "don't do that"  :-)

Seriously though, there is no reason you couldn't just send WWW-Realm-URI
after the user was authenticated.  If you do that then you aren't giving
away anything because the server can know what the user is allowed to
know.  Also, as shown below, a partial of the directory already accessed
could be returned if that is prefered (or nothing, it's totally up to the
server).

Client:
	GET /protected/recipies/secret-sauce/ingredients HTML/1.0
Server:
	401 Unauthorized
	WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="burgers_and_fries"
	WWW-Realm-URI: /protected/recipies/
Client:
	GET /protected/recipies/secret-sauce/ingredients HTML/1.0
	Authorization: Basic mickeyd:passwd
Server:
	200 Ok
	WWW-Realm-URI: /protected/recipies/, /protected/foodstuff/
	WWW-Realm-URI: http://otherserver/protected/foods/

Of course, just because you trust them doesn't mean they trust you.
This should be in the spec so that it is clear, assuming some
scheme like this is adopted.

Also, clients shouldn't trust other servers that use the same realm names
[obvious yes, but it should probably be in the spec anyway]

I think HTTP, FTP, etc., are the wrong places to look to get indexing
information.  They are very inefficient for collecting the information
because you have to set up connections, fork, etc. for each object
retrieval.  Also, they don't supply all the information you need
to build effective indexes (timestamps, MD5 signatures, etc.)

In Harvest (http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/) you can run a Gatherer at the
archive site, and it builds all this information and exports it very
efficiently.  It provides MD5s (which the Broker uses to do duplicate
elimnation) and timestamps (which you can use to do incremental updates).
It also supports much more efficient gathering than you get when gathering
via HTTP etc.  As an example, when we gathered the data needed to index the
AT&T 1-800 Telephone Directory, it took about 10 hours to pull the data
across the Internet.  In contrast, you can pull all of the data across the
Internet from our server as a single compressed, structured stream in just
a few mintues.  On average, running an archive-site Gatherer causes about
6,660x less load on the archive's CPU and 50x less network traffic than
doing remote gathering ala the robots - and this doesn't include the
savings you get from doing incremental updates (retrievals of the form
"give me all the content summaries for objects changed/created since date
XYZ").

As an intermediate step it would be really nice if one site would provide a
global index service.  This would use robot style expensive access to build
and update the indexes.  The indexes would conform to an agreed standard
(maybe Harvest).  And then every site could use harvest style access to the
one mega-site to get efficient index info as needed.  Add some mirror sites
and you have something that could be agreed on, adopted, and working
efficiently in a month or two.

Is this true?  I have always assumed that browsers resend names and
passwords for every access to the same machine and port AND REALM.
Surely, I can have more than one realm on one server.  If not there
is no point to realm.

Presumably the way it works now is that the browser tries
/protected/foods/, gets a 401 with the same realm as .../ingredients
and automatically resends the request with authorization, so the user
doesn't have to re-enter the password.  (The docs are clear that any
authorizations using the same password file should have the same
realm.  "burgers_and_fries" is a poor name choice for a realm
including foods and recipes -- I don't know if it was intended to be
significant or not).

So the bottom line is that this change would be invisible to the user
and would eliminate one transaction in some circumstances, at the expense
of added code in the browsers.  I wouldn't see this as a real high priority.

On the other hand the issue raised by Brian of cross-machine realms seems
very important and should get priority.  I don't see a need for 
WWW-Realm-Partial though.  Why not just add it to the realm.  Something
like:

WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="foods, hotwired1.com:bakery, hotwired3.com:meat"

This would allow a single virtual site to consist of several machines.

We would not! :-) We would say "What is your security policy? Is that
information world readable?" and "What is the strength of your
security system? Is it easy enough to spoof so that it doesn't
matter?". Since tcp addresses are spoofable anyway, making security
less friendly is only encouraging people to work around it, which
makes it less secure. User-friendly security _is_ better security.

Only if you've got a Mandatory Access Control policy, that mandates
that folks with a Confidential clearance can't know the names of Top
Secret files, since their names are Top Secret too. Anybody with this
policy isn't using the standard WWW security mechanisms :-).

Subject: Last-modified date & indexing
content-length: 1855

I think I should know the answer, but where is an HTTP server supposed to
get the HTTP last-modified date?  Is it from the file system (which
produces different results on various OSes), from the HTML header, or...?

As we're building our indexing tools, we're trying to figure out how to
trigger index updates efficiently, which is why I'm asking.

Eventually, I'd like our indexer to be able to ask the server "What's
changed since date XX/XX/XX" and get back either of two things:

* A list of the changed documents that are eligible for indexing
("eligible" as defined in "/robots.txt")

* An indication of whether it's going to be more efficient to do an
incremental update by GETting individual documents or just GET a locally
pre-built index from the server.

I'm implying something here that I should make clear.  We'll have an
indexer that will build a local index and save it into a compressed archive
file in the root of the HTTP server under a standard name.  Our remote
indexing tool will be able to retrieve that file and hand it off to our
search server.  Obviously, as others have concluded, this will be far
better use of network resources than the usual spider behavior.  (Our
indexes are usually less than half the size of the text they index, they
compress very well, and GETting one archived file is just one transaction
v. many.)

Updating the index creates an efficiency ambiguity.  If few documents have
changes, then it may be more efficient to GET the changed documents and
increment (v. getting the whole archived index).

Via last-modified date summary information, we can make an intelligent
decision about when to get individual documents v. when to get the whole
archived index.  Further, we can avoid recursing the documents to see
what's changed.

Thoughts?  Answer to the first question about last-modified date?

That's fine, but it's a bit difficult to reconcile last-modified dates from
HTTP when they're the only thing that's available for updating an index.

If you only need to update a few documents out of many, it's *more*
efficient to request them from the Web server, even if you used a local
tool to build the index in the first place, which is what we're building,
as I think I said.

I'm quite aware of Harvest.  Unfortunately, there are tens of thousands of
HTTP servers that our products have to be able to index.  We could ask all
of them to support Harvest's conventions, but I'm not going to wait to ship
a product until they do.

So we agree, then, on the efficiency of the approach.  I just can't figure
out why you started that paragraph with the words "In contrast."

This is also something we are interested in, with regard to zoned

However, I mentioned this to Simon at the conference, and he said that
they were already looking at something like this for HTML Level 3. I suggest
that followups get sent to html-talk rather than this newsgroup.

Mikhail Popov suggested adding Frames to HTML:

> a. possibility to reload part of the page, not next document

Fine, but this means that each frame must be stored in a separate file so the 
server can send it (hard on document authors) or that the server chops out the 
requested frame on demand (hard on server compute time).

The overhead on getting a whole text page is not that great unless the page is 
many many screenfuls long, in which case it would be better to split it up into 
a series of documents anyway.

If the graphics on part of a page are going to change at frequent intervals 
(like, every 10 minutes) put a short expiry on them so they are re-fetched by 
the client on re-retrieving the document, rather than being fetched from the 
clients cache.

Clients do check expiry on their internal caches, don't they ;-)


> b. possibility to make-up page and browse it as-is
>	o mixed fonts families

Adding just Frames to HTML would not give you multiple fonts. If you are trying 
to have different fonts for, say, headings and paragraphs, that can be done 
already. For example, I have X resources set so that Mosaic and Netscape use 
Helvetica Bold for all headings and New Century for all body text, same as our 
in-house printed documents.

If by mixed font families (reading between the lines of your email address) you 
mean actually mean mixed character sets (this paragraph in a western european 
font, this paragraph in a cyrillic font) then this is better done explicitly 
with charsets and lang attributes; I would refer you to the archives for 
previous discussion on this.

If by mixed fonts you mean different combinations of fonts in different columns, 
like some magazines, that is best done by stylesheets. I woulds also not that, 
as has been said before, carrying over print media conventions (multi columns, 
continued on page 88 column 3, etc) to online media is a mistake. Print media 
have limitations with the size of a printed page, which is typically too wide to 
have the text all in one column. This is not a problem with online media.

>	o fixed geometry
>	o e.t.c.
> c. possibility to have complex forms + heavy graphics

I think HTML 3 tables solve precisely what you are referring to for this one. 
They have the advantage over Frames of prior implementatioin and are resizable 
for different browser widths. If you have not already done so, and if you have 
access to a Unix machine, check out Arena from w3 org.

OK so you *did* want to slip in Cyrillic fonts. Doing this by referring to a 
specific Adobe font is not a great idea. What if someone does not have that 
font, but has a different font that would also do Cyrillic? What is the 
behaviour in that situation?

Labelling a bunch of unintelligible ISO Latin-1 characters as having meaning 
when rendered in a particular font designed for, say KOI-8 or ISO8858-9 (is it 
9?) is not, IMHO, a good way to proceed.

I was also dismayed to see that, in your proposal, frame and subframe positions 
are specified as x,y positions. In what - pixels? mm?

This seems to placxe a heavy reliance on particular browser widths or screen 
resolutions, which is clearly undesirable.

The mock-up on the www.doc.html page did not really show your suggested use of 
forms for advanced layout but I think that HTML 3 tables already do the sort of 
intricate image / form / text layout that you suggest.

That is entirely up to the server.  For the usual file objects, it is just
the file system last-mod date -- the server should be aware of the limitations
of the OS under which it runs.  For objects with includes, it may be the
most recent of the set of last-mod dates of its component parts.  For
database gateways, it may be the last-update timestamp of the record.
For virtual objects, it may be the last time its internal state changed.
In any case, the HTTP client should only know (and care) about the result --
whatever gets stuck in the Last-modified: header -- and not worry about
how it was obtained.

However, under no circumstances should it ever come from the HTML header.
That mechanism was never intended to provide values for metainformation
that can be (and is) more readily obtained elsewhere.

Hi,

I heard of a paper entitle something like

'Why the Worldwide Web should not be used for electronic publishing'

Has anyone seen a paper like this?  I believe it was published in a
refereed journal.

Any help is appreciated

That last part is a relief... ;-)

I guess that we really have no good choice, then, but to ask the server for
last-mod date for our indexer, if we want to be certain that it's
consistent.  That rules out file-system-based indexing as a generalized
approach, unfortunately.  It's also an argument for building the indexing
into the server.

Hmm.

Thanks for the explanation!

Just for the record, the author of "Teach Yourself HTML Web Publishing in 
a Week" is Laura Lemay. 

John December and Neil Randall are the authors of "The World Wide Web 
Unleashed" (which also covers HTML and Web design -- among many other 
things).

Both books are from Sams Publishing.

This message originated out of private email between myself (Chris Lilley) and 
Tony Sanders. We were talking about authentication realms, multiple servers, 
stuff like that, particularly in relation to the handling of partial URLs.

Apparently he liked my last email and requested that I post it to the list. So, 
as we are both agreed to that, here it is:

I always amused me when someone says "Oh, that's simple.  We'll just mark up
our publication in HTML."

Assuming that your physical media content will translate easily to online
media is as reasonable as assuming it would be a simple thing to "translate"
a novel into a screenplay.

Indeed, I agree fully, although I fail to see more than a tangential 
relationship to my original statement. Are you suggesting I said it was simple 
to translate print media to online media?

On the contrary, I spoke of an additional complication; that is was unwise to 
assume that the best way to lay out online media is exactly the same way as 
print media.

        I'm not sure I agree that it shouldn't be in the HTML,
but I feel strongly that the HTTP header is *the* place for filesystem
related meta-information.

        Seems I'm constantly having to beat people around Rice over the
head to use  -p  when copying files.   It's really annoying to have new
timestamps slapped on files just because someone was too lazy when
moving things from one volume to another.   So I'm really tempted to
see an option for this to be an HTML header item too.   Just ...
maybe not this century.   ;-)

 I've looked at long discussion about internationalization problems inside
html documents.
 We (in Russia) have same hold discussions, when porting Unix to local
platforms... A lot of ideas come at this time, but life make choice to only
one KOI-8, and it's live now (really live).Why? is reasonable question,
answer is very simple: we just used DEC-like terminals. Later MSDOS come
too, and what is standard now? "ALT-ernative code set "for MSDOS users
(reason add Cyrillic characters and keep IBM-PC pseudo-graphics) As result
we have set of code-tables for representing computer documents. From other
side, there is standard for encoding Cyrillic docu- ments (well knowing
IS0-8858-9), but at this time it has usage less than 1%.

What registry sets should support browser KOI-8, ISO8858-9, JISX0208.1983 or
all?

I think, document should has inside all need resources for TRUE browsing,
adding extra font fea- tures to html and browsers is a good choice.

The W3 has good taste for any one who want to deliver good cooked
information about yourself!

My opinion, the end-user should have open interface to WWW world
(html+windoing browsers) for representing information. I hope, that's main
task of html and browsers developers and network service providers :-), so
just "open the door".

Mikhail.

Which is why the BASIC security scheme is not long for this world (hopefully).
It is just about the one bit of HTTP spec that I would like to explicitly
drop from future specs.

The difference between `file not found' and `not authorised' is siginificant
in some cases but these are rare. For example knowing that 
/hallam/docs/skipjack.ps existed would be of interest to some :-)

One case in point I wrote a bit of code the other day that added a link
into a link database through a series of forms. Only there was a small snag,
if the form was reloaded the link was entered again!

This provides a bit of a problem, I want the behaviour to be such that a POST
performs an action but a GET merely reports the previous sucess code. Its
quite easy once you realise the problem but otherwise "you are toast".

Suprious GETs can occur very easily as a result of the history cache
being exhausted and a person using forward/backward too often...

Not necessarily. The fact that several popular servers work in this way does
not mean that all do. In fact one server I know of runs on a machine where the
concept of a file is meaningless.

Even amongst file based operating systems the UNIX model of `all files are
linear sequences of characters' is not universal. There are many systems that
have working models. The problem cited is yet another reason why the UNIX
file model is broken.

Better for whom? There are many instances in which obtaining a file as a single
unit is much more convenient. For example when editing I do not want to be
concerned with the fact that a single logical document is accessible at the
chapter level as separate texts.


The model I was considering was based on progressive editing modes, the simplest
of which being :-

1) Delete all and replace	(ie what we have now)
2) Append to end		(Terminal style interaction)
3) Merging Differences

To give a concrete example, imagine we have a persistent connection to an
asynchronous source, might be a room in a MUD or conference system for example.
The first two modes are quite natural, we enter a new room and the whole
situation is changed what we want implemented is `clear screen' logicaly
this is `delete all and replace'. The append function is usefull for `frodo
enters by the east door type messages'. IRC is an example of an append only
interaction mode.

Merging differences needs a bit more care since there is more than one way to
do it. Here the likely usage is as a collaborative editing system in which
multiple users are performing some sort of discussion. Imagine we have an IRC
or a WIT off to one side and a moderator editing a consensus document. As the
moderator enters changes these must be notified to the other participants.

I prefer a structure which uses the structure of the HTML to provide location
information. For example how about:

H1:2/H2:4/H3:3/P:4/10,15

Being the tenth to fifteenth tokens in the fourth paragraph in the third
H3 within the fourth H2 within the second H1.


Actually this is nonsense in terms of SGML because H1s etc are not containers.
You need to incorporate Divisions for that. But remember the motto `screw SGML'.


OK given such a labeling scheme we can define a few editing operations.
Delete, Insert, Replace to operate on the texts. We then work out the minimal
editing operations to trasfrom one text into another. This is called 
Unification in the AI world, something I tend to associate with shaven headed
people wearing safron robes and carrying bongo drums but there you are.

I would also humbly submit the same scheme to be used as an extension to the
anchor label scheme in HTML proper ie say

http://bongo.cern.ch/fred.html#H1:2/H2:4/H3:3/P:4/10,15


I would also like a similar scheme for text/plain. There we need two index
methods, row/colum and octets from start:

fred.txt#1,3:4,6	row 1 col 3  through row 4 col 6
fred.txt#3:56		byte 3 for 56 bytes

Personally I find record-oriented files awkward, not to mention that they 
could always be represented in Unix as directories.  Records are 
candy-coating, they may taste good but they're hard to digest.

A decent UI should be capable of attaining this level of abstraction.  
Anyhow, HTML is no kind of markup language to write a book in.  It's 
optimized for short pages and small, simple structures.

No, this is nonsense in terms of HTML.  SGML is perfectly capable of 
supporting adequate structural containers, but these were not included in 
the HTML spec.

How do you incorporate lists and sectioning by horizontal rules in this?

HTML just generally loses at representing large-scale 'vertical' text 
structures well.  This is something that ought to be fixed, not kludged 
around.

AI?  Hardly.  A simple variant of Unix diff could handle this fine.

This would be a great idea were there only some real containers to be used.

What form of line separation would you use for 'octets'?  And how would 
you deal with Unicode?

I seem to be forever repeating myself. The syntax above is not
correct. The TEI people have already been down this path, and already
have a syntax which I proposed quite some time ago as an extension to
URL's for performing sub-document addressing. In fact, they have 2
syntaxes which are equally useful.

section=1/subsection=2/para=3

or

1/2/3

I should note that HTML has few containiers as noted above, but we can
just look upon this as a degenerate case of deeply structured
documents. In fact, even things like RTF and LaTeX can have thier
components addressed by such schemes.

Now, the real proof that this is useful can be seen in the DynaWeb
server that I wrote for EBT. In DynaWeb, we can use either of the
above 2 schemes, or direct element addressing (DynaWeb serves up
large SGML books (a single database) and use the above to navigate the
internals of a document. ) I should note that in DynaWeb, almost every
URL is generated on the fly from the structure of the document, for
example, TOC's aree generated automatically.

Why reinvent the wheel? The TEI people have thought long and hard
about this, and it works well in practise. Stop thinking of documents
as linear block of text: even the most trivial document has a tree
structure. Think like this, and such schemes just fall out of the
woodwork.

I am struggling right now with reading a record-oriented format (library 
MARC records) on a system that *is* record-oriented (VMS) but does not know 
about this particular format.  My suspicion is that you need in the OS both 
the low-level, UNIX-style byte stream file access as well as a higher-level 
record-oriented file access format for maximum data access at maximum speed. 
 A compiled language for record access (like Perl's pack()/unpack() only 
much more sophisticated) would be nice too...

Your English is fine.  Not perfect, but quite understandable.
If there are others out there who are reluctant to post be-
cause of "bad" English, I hope they'll put aside their fears -
like the above poster.

No one here is going to jump on anyone for bad English.

Subject: Distribution of CERN WWW software
From: fluckiger@vscrna.cern.ch (Francois Fluckiger)
content-length: 1070

Dear Colleagues,

Some of you asked about the conditions for the distribution of 
new versions of the CERN WWW Library of Common Code (libwww), the 
CERN Line Mode Browser (www) and the WWW HTTP Daemon (httpd).

The new versions will remain freely available, for general use, and at
no cost.

The only change is that the material distributed will remain
copyrighted by CERN. As a consequence, a copyright notice will have to
appear in copies, but also, the rights of the users will be protected,
in particular by preventing third parties to turn free software into
proprietary software, and deny the users the rights to freely use the
material.

These principles are those used by most distributors of free software,
including the X consortium.

The proper copyright notice is being ratified and will be available in
a few days.

We hope all those who have trusted CERN WWW software will continue to
do so, and will appreciate that these conditions not only maintain the
free distribution but better protect it.

Subject: How about an "IF" markup construct...
content-length: 982

 
I realize that people will probably jump on my "case" for say such
things, but here it goes...
 
There has been discussion about "what does the browser support". why
not make it part of the document?  Personally, I'm tired of loading
a table of clients v.s. support into my server so that I can server
the correct documents to people.
 
Imagine if it was possible to do:
        <IF TABLE=TRUE>
        <TABLE>
                ...
        </TABLE>
        <ELSE>
        <PRE>
                ...
        </PRE>
        </IF>
 
It means that "IMG" could really be like:
        <IF INLINE_IMAGES>
        <IMG SRC=...>
        <ELSE>
        text...links..other fun things..  Nice _complicated_ markup
        </IF>
 
This would probably mean that HTML was no longer SGML compliant, but
is this something that we are really necessary?
 
I realize that in the case of tables documents get longer, but
it also means that they could be created programatically.

No, I don't buy any such nonsense.  It's either free or it's restricted.
Please explain.  I'll reserve my real flames until later.

Sounds more to me like they are going to start charging for access
to the technology.

Actually, there sort of is.

Our company, HyperAct, Inc. has a product named HLPDK/PA - a Write Once, Help 
Many product, that can create multiple help databases from one source.

With HLPDK/PA there is a program that translates your WinHelp sources to 
HLPDK sources, that can be compiled, using the HLPDK compiler, to HTML 
format.

The WinHelp -> HLPDK program can not take you all the way, but it can save 
you some of the work ..


The nice thing, is that after you convert it to HLPDK's native HDF format, 
you will be able (using the HLPDK compiler) to port it to HTML, Windows 
Help, OS/2 Help, DESQview/X, MM Viewer and several dos targets.

An evaluation package of HLPDK is available on garbo.uwasa.fi in the 
/pc/programming directory as hdk115a.zip, hdk115b.zip and hdk115l.zip.

For more information about HLPDK/PA please contact 
76350.333@Compuserve.Com. (I'm gonna be on the road soon, so this is the 
fastest way to get answers about HLPDK or HLPDK/PA).

Ron.

    Probably unecessary - if I recall correctly, Oracle 7.0 has an environment 
variable called TWO_TASK.  When this variable is set, all requests are sent
to this machine for processing.  BTW, a backend to oracle is available via:

	URL:ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/gvu/www/pitkow/gsql-oracle

Sooner or later, oracle may decide to support a gateway directly for their
clients.

I am writing a WWW browser and can't quite figure out how browsers tell a server
that they understand 'indirection.' I get the following from my
server,

>GET /homepage/glim
><HTML>

><TITLE>Redirection</TITLE>
></HEAD>
><BODY>
><H1>Redirection</H1>
>This document can be found
><A HREF="http://mathsoft/homepage/glim/">elsewhere.</A><P>

>CERN httpd 3.0pre6</A></ADDRESS>
></BODY>
></HTML>
>Connection closed by foreign host. 

I would like to support "Automatic redirection handling" is the answer
just parsing the above html? Or is there a way to send a request to
the server telling it you want the redirected URL sent back to you?

If anyone could answer this or provide me with pointers on a more
complete/explicit http spec. (i have the rtf draft, which is a bit 
vague) i would greatly appreciate it.

thanks

Sounds to me CERN want to prevent other people from making money out of CERN's
work, which is a very reasonable thing to do IMHO. Of course, if BSDI made money
selling CERN WWW software in the past, you may not appreciate it :-)

CERN's policy for WWW software seems very close to MIT's policy for X11. Are you
unhappy with this one as well ? Do you also hate copy-lefted GNU software ? Must
belong to a very restricted club, then...  :-)

We call that candy coating `abstraction'. Because UNIX types have never had
it they do not know what they are missing. Of course it takes more intense
mental effort to produce well abstracted code. The point is that a week of hard
thinking may save several months of low abstraction level hacking.

Nope, that is not what the idea is. The optimisation is towards hyperlinked
segments of information. The small part comes in only as a style issue.

SGML is alledgedly quite capable of doing everything. The problem is that the
designers did not try an implementation of many features before they piled
them into the spec. Test implementations are frowned upon in ISO because the
firm that builds one has a head start on the others.

<HR> Elements are a Mosaic inspired abomination. Lists are another type of
paragraph markup.


Actually if you read the ISO stylesheet draft spec it starts off essentially
defining the sort of tree structure I propose. It has to be built at a logical
level somewhere in the parse module in any case.

The UNIX diff scheme is a Unification algorithm. The problem is actually quite
hard (np-complete in fact). The UNIX diff program is inappropriate because it is
line based and HTML is a structural markup.

If a file is an octet stream (ie binary data) then it is by definition not
text/plain. UNICODE is more problematic since the file might be UTF encoded
or be in unpacked (explicit) form. Here I would suggest that the byte count
be an actual byte count and not a character count but that the row/col system
work by character.

Until UNICODE based programming languages become comonplace I doubt that there
will be much use for the UNICODE variants since most other text needing fancy
fonts will have other formatting (eg HTML).

Not correct by whose definition? Are you refering to W3O or W3C draft specs or
an RFC from the IETF? Only the latter is definitive with respect to the Web

Code ? Implementation? Rough consensus and working code!

What relation do these `sections' have to HTML elements. Is H1 a section?
Is H2 a subsection? What is a H3???

Is this an SGML standard or a Web standard? Who has commented on it? Dave 
Ragget? Tim B-L? If its an SGML standard don't imagine that it has any
relationship to HTML.

It is possible to create containers by associating sections of text with the
preceeding headers and nesting Hn+1 elements within Hn elements. This may be
hard to express in SGML lossage but that is SGML for you.

You have all the information you need in the status return code from

Have you considered using the Library of Common Code - then you get all

Subject: Potentially serious error in unix server http logging.
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Date: Wed, 16 Nov 94 08:07:42 -0500
From: Simon E Spero <ses@tipper.oit.unc.edu>
content-length: 2336

Whilst doing a bit of log-file analysis, I've come across what appears to be 
a worrying, and possibly serious error which seems to be common to every 
http server for unix. 

The problem comes in handling cases where a file request is aborted by the 
client by the client dropping its end of the connection. This case is sometimes
erroneously logged as being successful even when the disconnect is detected; 
however, for a large class of cases (including the one I was actually interested
in, demmit), the client disconnection is never discovered by the server. 

The reason for this is related to the unix habit of asynchronous I/O. The server
can often complete its write to the output socket without all the data
having been delivered. When the server has finished writing its data to the 
output stream, it will usually call close to bring down the connection. If the
linger option has been set, the close will wait for some time before completing-
otherwise the close will succeed immediately, and the data will be delivered 
by the operating system in the background. In the latter case, the server 
will not be able to detect the cancellation. IF linger option is selected, 
implemented, and working, the failure will be reported as an error in the
call to close.

This problem only occurs if the server finishes writing data to the socket
before the cancellation is received. The amount of data remaining to be sent 
at the point at which is occurs is dependent on the size of the socket buffer.
A typical size for this sees to be around 8K.

The reason I got got caught up in this mess is that I was trying to estimate the
effect of parallel retrievals on the number of cancelled transactions. This is 
interesting, because as the number of concurrent fetches increases, so to 
does the number of concurrent cancellations. Also, with browsers such as 
IBM's explorer and Netscape's Netscape, transaction cancellation becomes an 
active part of the operational paradigm, rather than an exceptional condition
occuring relatively infrequently. Unfortunately, the object types most affected
by this change in access patterns are those used for icons - which are also the
types most likely to be missed by the logs.

Inline Support for Vector Files: Engineering Dawings on the WWW
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/IT94/Proceedings/DDay/moline/moline.html

How was this paper received at the conference?  This is an issue I would 
like to see addressed.  In the School of Geosciences at QUB we want to 
provide maps and GIS information over the Web and support for an inline 
vectro format is critical.

Jodi mentioned that DXF, the de facto standard, is being looked at but 
hinted that it does not meet the needs for an inline vector format, and 
SoftSource intent to create a new vector format meet the needs.

If you read this list Jodi (you did not give your email address)  why does 
the standard format, DXF, not meet the needs.  Does the fact that many 
current CAD, GIS and image pckages support DXF not mean we should push it as 
the standard format?

I believe he was referring to NCSA Mosaic, but I have yet to
confirm this.  

My question to this list:  Is this a widespread limitation of
web clients?  Due to some shared source library which enforces it?

More generally, I would be interested in any reference material, specs,
or guidelines for the handling of image display in clients.  

I would also be interested in any such material on image quality standards
for the web.  My sense is that this does not exist.  While there may be
agreed to standards for file format, the issue is larger that that.  If
I get confirmation that this is relatively uncharted territory, I may
start an effort to address it.  

The prevalence of imaging on the web is large and likely to grow.  Given
all the attention paid to the quality of text display, it seems appropriate
that we should do the same for images.

How does one define a "chapter" in HTML? A Section? Unless one can
work in the abstractions of the *author* one is missing the boat
entirely...

Bollocks. Most people avoid the grottier features of SGML and everyone
recognises that this is the correct thing to do. I don't think anyone
frowns on DYnaText, or the other SGML systems available, and *none* of
these support the full language. In fact, if you want an easily
parseable SGML subset that retains 98% of the usefule features of
SGML, I suggest reading the TEI spec (which you obviously have not
done yet).

The tree structure you describe is not your invention. Every man and
his dog in document processing has seen this. This is *inherent* in
any information system. DSSSL starts with this because it recognises
explicitly the tree, and also recognises the value of tree
transformations in document processing. I should note that DSSSL-Lite
is now being developed with the specific aim of being used for WWW and
that the tree transofmration stuff was left off because it was thought
"too difficult".

If I understand what you are asking, the Sun will need SQL*net and, in our
case, Pro*C to allow you to write cgi scripts.  With Pro*C you will
be able to use embedded SQL or (my favorite) oraperl.

I assume you just did this by telnetting to the port your server uis running on, 
probably 80.

What you sent was an HTTP 0.9 request. Try issuing a 1.0 request instead:

GET /homepage/glim HTTP/1.0<return>
<return>

Then you will get back numeric error codes and other useful headers, which is 
what your browser should use to detect that a redirect has ocurred so it goes 
and fetches the new document.

("Bollocks"? Are you English, or did you translate into the native idiom?:)

Phil's comment about SGML being spec'd without implementation isn't strictly
true. In fact, the situation is pretty much the reverse... SGML grew out 
of IBM's GML- A lot of the peculiarities are the result of implementation 
features of GML that slid their way in to the standard. All sorts of whacky 
restrictions in the standard make a strange sort of sense if you think about
them in the context of one particular implementation of a parser.

Urf.

Let's pretend for a moment that the Web and indeed most of computing science was 
all invented in Japan and supports only Kanji characters. Someone boldly 
suggests that it would make a few people happy on the other side of the pacific 
rim if a larger code space was used so we couild have, for example, a few code 
pages for western european languages. These code pages make aup a fledgeling new 
standard called ASCII

But then someone else say no, lets wait a bit. If people need this fancy spazzy 
stuff they probably need other features as well - besides, hardly anyone is 
using it

For people who use languages ill-served by ISO Latin 1, the extra characters are 
not just fancy fonts, they are a means of just typing in ordinary text. You 
can't get more basic than that.

It is a widespread limitation of X clients. The X color model is, to
be polite, inconvenient. As an X client, you can either share the
public colormap, and hope that you can allocate the colors you need,
or you can install your own colormap, and invoke the technicolor
effect.

Most commercial X apps try to use the public colormap, and use it
conservatively. For example, I worked on the AVS project a while ago,
and when AVS started up, it would try to allocate a 6x6x6 colorcube,
and if that failed, I think it would try to get a 4x4x4, and if that
failed, it would say "you gotta be kidding!" and give up. There
was a command-line option to instruct AVS to use a private colormap.

I think netscape does something similar. And FrameMaker, as I recall.

I don't think NCSA Mosaic's color policy is very flexible. But then, I
don't expect folks that give away source code to be all things to all
people ;-)

>More generally, I would be interested in any reference material, specs,
>or guidelines for the handling of image display in clients.  

For X specs,
See: Information about X
http://www.x.org/consortium/x_info.html

Meanwhile, the Mac and Windows platforms have completely independent
color policies. And while these are the three main platforms, nobody
said that they are the only platforms in the world.

For guidelines, there's the Motif styleguide and Apples User Interface
Guidelines, thought I haven't read their color recommendations carefully.
I expect that Microsoft provides some specs/guidelines in this area too.

Hmmm... I bet there are some papers in the Computer-Human Interface
journals on this sort of thing. There are several excellent techreport
indexes on the web that I don't have ready access to right now. Sombody
want to a little surfing and see what there is to see?

Go for it! I STRONGLY encourage you to scope out a set of issues and
start an open forum to address them. Start here on www-talk, if you
like, and then migrate it to a separate mailing list (please archive
it!).

  If you're relying on SQL*net security for access to the database,
you may want to make sure no one can listen in on the Oracle<->web
server connection--unless you want users to change information for
each other.

  Our web->Oracle interface runs over a DES-encrypted connection using
RPCs to allow updates and queries of the database. The http
client-server connection is also encrypted using the Kerberos4 patches
for lynx & NCSA mosaic.

Subject: Server Access logs
content-length: 712

I'm researching ways to autonomously replicate web objects, and I am
using web server access logs to fuel my trace-driven simulations. It
would be very useful if these access logs recorded not only the
information they record now, such as file size, time-stamp of request,
and machine requesting the page, but also the time that the file was
last modified. Without this information it is impossible to determine
when objects in the cache go stale, and therefore it is impossible to
simulate the cache at all. I have modified our local web server, but i
bring this to this mailing list because I think that this is a truly
useful piece of information to log.

Opinions?

He was referring to the default behaviour of NCSA Mosaic for X when displaying 
on a pseudocolor visual. So, the Mac and PC Mosaic programs, which are quite 
different programs, may well not suffer from this problem. Also, NCSA Mosaic for 
X does not suffer from this problem when displaying to a TrueColor or 
DirectColor visual; here, each GIF is displayed with the full 256 colours each.

Furthermore, it is only a default and can be changed. I had Mosaic set up to 
allocate 200 colours, for example. The reason this was done was apparently to 
avoid colour clashing when running an MPEG viewer I am quite happy to have all 
my windows turn green on the odd occasion that I run an MPEG viewer, if it gives 
me better images.

> My question to this list:  Is this a widespread limitation of

Well yes, in that often clients run in environments with inadequate or grossly 
inadequate numbers of colours. 32k colours gives good results; 256 colours gives 
severe limitations but is frequently used, and I recently saw someone access a 
page on computer graphics from a PC running in 16 colour VGA. Gross.

Of course, cleint can choose to do something other than the fastest and nastiest 
colour quantiser they happen accross. Median cut is not so bad, either, it could 
be truncation ;-) Netscape for X, for example, appears to do Floyd-Steinberg 
error diffusion dithering which frequently gives better results on pages with 
many images, all using very different pallettes.

> Due to some shared source library which enforces it?

No, not at all. Each client does whatever their implementors chose to do.

There are guidelines out there which explain how to quantise all the images on 
one page down to the same colourmap, of 256 or even of 50 colours. This is a bad 
idea in general. The aim should be to maximise the quality of image provided by 
the server, and let the clients hack the images down as needed. Plenty of PC and 
Mac users run their browsers in a 32k colours or 16M colours environment. 
Kludging the GIFs so that they cope with current behavious of a particular 
browser in certain situations is a short term fix.

Of course, if you are providing, say, a CWIS and you know that the vast majority 
of your users are running with 50 colour Mosaics on slow lines with slow CPUs, 
then the wins in transmission speed (GIFS with large blocks of the same colour 
are smaller) and decoding speed may be more important.

But in general, optimise the quality of what you send.

And as for quantising all the GIFS on one page to the same colourmap; apart from 
the inevitable reduction in quality compared to an optimum pallette for each 
GIF, plus the reduction in quality caused by doing two quantisations (24 bit 
original to 256 colour GIF, then again to a different 256 colours) how do you 
know that these pictures will not be used on other pages in combination with 
other GIFS?

> I would also be interested in any such material on image quality standards

Pretty much. Netscape, Chimera and emacs w3 allow inline JPEG and often these 
are smaller than GIF and look better on displays with more colours. There is no 
particular consensus on things like gamma - servers running where their 
webmasters use SGI's tend to have no gamma correction, relying on the default 
1.7 correction in SGI's X server and forgetting that they are the only 
manufacturer to do this.

Simnilarly people who use Photoshop on a Mac tens to assume that the image will 
be gamma corrected at 1.8 prior to viewing, which of course on PCs and most Unix 
workstations, on OpenVMS and VM and CMS and indeed on Macs when displayed 
inline, it isn't. Arena now has a gamma command line oprtion which is nice.

The TIFF spec says that RGB TIFF should incorporate a gamma of 2.2

Utah RLE and TIFF include tags that tell you what the image gamma and assumed 
display gamma is, but cludgy unix utilities like the pbm toolkit (useful, but 
kludgy hacks nonetheless) ignore all this information.

You don't see many PhotoCD files flying around the net, probably because of the 
well-documented furore when PhotoCD specs were witheld from hobbyist developers 
which I am sure you are aware of.

For myself, on servers I maintain:

- Baseline TIFF 5 images are gamma corrected to 2.2 as per the spec

- JPEG JFIF images we tend not to use becuase, dealing with computer graphics we 
may want to analyse the images and lossy compression is no use there. Some 
images which are just decorative may well use JPEG though 

- all GIFS are quantised to 256 colours unless they clearly require less (ie if 
quantising to less looks the same when viewed on a 24 bit screen

This seems to give the best results on the various browsers we have access to 
and looks fine except on SGI machines where the images are rather washed out and 
faint from being gamma corrected twice. We do say on our web pages what the 
gamma used was, so SGI users who care could save the images to disk and view 
with 

xv -visual TrueColor -gamma 0.45

if they really want.

In the future - well, TIFF 6 includes a CIE LAB image type and I would be most 
pleased if browsers supported this, none do at the moment and neither do 
external viewsers. But it would give device independent colour.

Hmm - so should style sheets include instructions on how to deliver gamut 
warning alarms? ;-)

Complete agreement.

Interested to see your proposals here. 

Be aware though that the web is very much an open standards forum when framing 
your proposals, and remember that PhotoCD access from Unix boxes and other less 
common platforms lags behind Mac and PC deployment of PhotoCD plugins. Also the 
number of people viewing images is vastly greater than the number of people 
creating them (shame but true) and that even shareware viewers are enough to put 
off some sites. To be viable, multiplatform free viewers are a must.

If however you want to talk about image quality standards for gamut, colour 
space, headroom and footroom, gamma, using the web to move around colour 
corrected prepress images, etc then I am most interested to hear what you have 
to say.

I can't think of the type of converter you want off hand. However, you

I suspect that we are talking about W3O and not CERN.

My guess is that they plan on making money off of memberships to the
consortium (a good thing and I hope my company will join) and somehow
believe that will be more possible if they own the copyrights to libwww.
Let's just say that I'm skeptical that this is the best solution.  The
code has been in the public domain in the past and the WWW project has
grown at a phenomenal rate.  I see no reason that changing this will be
better for the WWW project as a whole, tell me why I'm wrong.

They have much more to offer than the copyright on libwww (which isn't at
all a key piece of technology itself).  They have some incredible talent
at their disposal (TimBL just to start) and I believe that W3O will be
critical to the development of WWW in the future.

I want to see the new copyright and then I'll decide what I want to do.
I hope I'm wrong but I did want to make my objection public so that this
issue could be discussed.

Showing great personal restraint I will not address your other, errr,
ummm, "arguments"; which have nothing to do with the point at hand or WWW.

I'm hoping sooner or later database companies realize that httpd servers are
really just internet front-ends to public or private databases and start
bundling or selling httpd servers that sit directly on top of their
technology - not cgi-bin gateways, but an integrated part of the database 
itself.  Anyone doing something like this for Sybase?  I've got a 
shopping list of server dream features that require this...

Neither of these happen with the Windows Web server. It immediately
detects a closure by the client. No entry is made in the access log 
unless the transaction completes, including successfully sending the
server's response (whatever that is) back to the client.

Thanks for the many helpful responses to my last mailing!

Just one more naive question...

I've noticed that there seem to be a number of GIF formats out there,
including one that NetScape loads across the whole image incrementally.
Question - does there exist good public domain source code to convert
from all the flavors of GIF to Windows BMP (or just straight rgb). I have
some source, but it doesn't seem to work on some GIFs.
Also, does anyone know the pointer to a description of the official
Gif standard on the internet (I don't have compuserve)? 

I saw some stuff in the graphics FAQ about "pbmplus"  for this task,
but it's been hard to get onto an ftp server that has it.

Thanks again for the help,

This has nothing to do with X, it's a hardware problem.  If your hardware
has a 24-bit visual or supports multiple colormaps then X can take advantage
of that.  But most cheap hardware only has a single 8-bit color map and
there isn't anything the software can do to work around that problem; you
must either limit your allocation if you want to share or allocate
and switch colormaps.

I will SECOND THE MOTION.  While not every one wants a commercial WWW

Subject: To write HTML = Assembler ...
content-length: 897


I've been into the WWW writing for five days and the only thing I can say 
is:
It's like programming assembler in the early days. (Miss the punch cards 
;-))

Well, I can stand the cumbersome way writing the files with tags (with more 
or less sophisticated editors/Word macros), but I can't agree with the way 
we have to handle internal and external links (including pictures).

Changing one only location for a file can break the entire chain, not to 
mention if you decide to move your files from one directory to another ... 
Ones you have designed the directory structure, you are bound to this.

I'm looking for a HTML database tool that can keep track of my page 
structure and  the links where I graphically can design my work (like you 
can in many 4th generation program generators).

Any tips of such tool would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I agree :-) I live in Japan. The Japanese still have some problems
with Unicode, but I think almost everyone here realises that it offers
99% of what most people want in document portability. As such, I would
dearly love to see the character encoding in text/html and text/sgml
to be either UTF-8 or UTF-7. As it is now, writing a Japanese WWW
browser is not trivial.

We've built our Web server directly on top of our engine, giving direct
access to our indexes, whether they're built with our tools or our engine
OEM'ed by Lotus, Adobe or whomever.  But we're a full-text database, rather
than a relational database -- a rather different animal, with the resulting
performance differences in text v. fielded search and retrieval.

I have to say that it sounds like you're making a bad assumption here --
that a relational database is a good way to store text objects.  Certainly
Oracle is making that argument, but I don't believe it.

It seems clear to me that information systems need aspects of each --
relational databases and full-text engines.  A database is good for fielded
resource management, including traditional document management functions.
We already have a flat database in our engine for that reason (in addition
to the full-text index).  With a key shared between our flat database and a
relational database, the two can be linked together.  We have an open
gateway architecture which our clients have used to wire us Sybase, Oracle
etc.

We'd like to integrate the two more thoroughly, as would the database
companies.  There are many ways that could happen.

There's a very simple integration of a database and our engine on our demo
pages, accessible from <URL:http://www.verity.com/>.  Look at the Photo
Search Demo.

BTW, we're about to hook in a new version to our public pages (we still
haven't announced it as a product, but, um, ah, we keep showing it and
naming pre-release customers) that adds free-text parsing -- it does the
"find me more like this" function.

Jump...on the bandwagon not case.

Good idea...There are a lot of purposes for conditional logic. 
We have put this type of thing into the help language SDL.
What do you see for the variables? CGI paramaters tests? Any
sort of history info such as if "x is in the history list" then 
"show y" or else "show z"?

IMHO SGML compliance is a must--why would this not be SGML compliant? 
It can be done quite legally even if it violates the common practice 
of only using element semantics drawn from the authors linguistic domain.

I am writing a handbook on Running A WWW Service.  The handbook 
is aimed at the UK academic community, but it will be available on 
WWW.  It is intended for staff in central services or academic 
departments in UK universities who are considering installing or have 
just installed a WWW service.

I am looking for volunteers to check the handbook to ensure that I am 
not giving out any bad advice.  I would also appreciate feedback from 
developers of WWW clients (what's the current position with Netscape?) 
and utilities, HTML authoring tools, etc. mentioned in the handbook 
(have I got the licensing conditions correct, have I got the anonymous 
FTP address correct, are you happy with me including/omitting the name 
and email address of the software developer?).  I would also like 
feedback from mailing list administrators to ensure that I am giving the 
correct information about their lists.

I would also like to hear from anyone outside the UK who could mirror 
the handbook.  I would expect this service to be provided by a national 
service.

The current table of contents is given below (and yes CWISes and

Actually if you look back I think you will find that I have been one of the principal
proponents of using UNICODE for exactly the reasons cited. In fact I have produced
the code for UNICODE support and hope to be incorporating it into a browser soon.

The point I was making is that IMHO text/plain is not a high value markup even with
UNICODE and that given a UTF encoding it is reasonable to encode it as octet adressable
rather than by character cell. Actually on reflection I don't like that idea anymore,
it means that the position of the anchor would change depending on whether the file
was sent in UTF or unpacked format which I don't like at all :-)

I doubt that the Japaneese would want to use UTF encoding in any case the principal
reason for supporting UTF is that it is very efficient for Western European text and
OK for eastern european, or at least as efficient as a scheme not using context switching
wich must be avoided like the plague since the files then become linear braindamage
which cannot be interpreted except by starting from the beginning. If people are 
prepared to forgo character index adressing then Huffman coding provides much
better compression than merely switching character sets.


Actually one point to be made clear. A UNICODE Web document should be interpreted in
the context of the Content-Language specified. Thus if the language is Japaneese the
Han characters should be displayed as Japaneese, not US inspired mid pacific bit-savers.

I was thinking specifically of the HYTIME extensions that recently were passed
'Unanimously' despite there being no implementation. And of course without bothering
to look at what was already in the field. 

As for `most people with sense avoid the worse features of this standard'. Lets think
about that for a moment eh? Basically you are saying that the standard works because
people don't follow it. Or in other words the standard is not in fact a standard. 
That being the case what should be done is to take the standard and rewrite it
depreciating the more egregious lossage. 

As for not reading the TEI spec. I follow the ISO standard, 50 quid it cost me. Are
you saying that I have the wrong standards body and that TEI is really the definitive
version? If so we should get this cleared up as soon as possible.

The problem that I have with this "X is wonderful it can do everything" attitude is
that X frequently turns out to have two operating modes, it can either be simple
or it can be doing everything and the two modes are disjoint. 

If TEI are willing to send me a copy of their specification without cost I will
read it. If anyone is using their standard within the Web it would of course have
greater weight. But if its simply an unconnected commercial implementation
then I am sure the IETF will give it due weight in their considerations.


The point that I am making is that Gavins assertion that my suggestion is 
`incorrect' is more than suspect. Unless he can point to an ISO or IETF
standard that it conflicts with I reject his assertion. At best he can claim
`incompatibility with existing implementation'.

Is the above in either the W3O, the W3C or the IETF? Does anyone use
this? As you so nicely point out, standards mean nothing if they are
not used. It just so happens that the TEI people have some very large
archives, and some very large SGML documents, and they needed a way to
retrieve only parts of the documents, and so they invented the 2
methods I outlined, among others. You seem to suffer from the awful
"not invented here" malady. Why not make use of something that is
already accepted by quite a few people in academia? I will repeat:
Phil proposed this:

 http:///bongo.cern.ch/fred.html#H1:2/H2:4/H3:3/P:4/10,15

while I proposed long ago the use of the TEI invented naming schemes.

 http:///bongo.cern.ch/fred.html/section=2/subsection=4/subsubsection=3/P=4
 http:///bongo.cern.ch/fred.html/2/4/3/4

(Note that the second uses the child number of the element, whereas
the first is using the occurence of the element name within the child
list.) 

>Code ? Implementation? Rough consensus and working code!

As I pointed out, in the DynaWeb server (which I wrote) can use
these. DynaWeb uses the structure of the SGML document tree to
generate TOC's on the fly, and (as a configuration item) one can use
either the above 2, or element ID addressing to retrieve a single
element, or a single subtree from the document. Even in multimegabyte
documents, retrieval takes milliseconds. This is converted to
HTML on the fly. I should point out that managing a single document
and having navigational links mostly generated on the fly is a lot
more convenient than managing a number of little HTML files, and
worse, all the links between them.

>What relation do these `sections' have to HTML elements. Is H1 a section?
>Is H2 a subsection? What is a H3???

Well, now we come to the crux of the matter. HTML was very poorly
designed because it ignored the inherent structure of documents, so in
fact we don't have many containers... if we want to address
something using the TEI stuff, it will be very "flat"
(fred.html/P=14). 

>Is this an SGML standard or a Web standard? Who has commented on it? Dave
>Ragget? Tim B-L? 

This is a *humanities* standard. The people found that using SGML was
of great benefit, because they have *huge* data repositories, and so I
guess one could also say it's an SGML, standard. Now, while I have
every respect for Tim B-L, I'm not sure he knows all that much about
document processing on a large scale. Dave Ragget certainly knows SGML
well. Ask him for comments.

I should note that no-one now controls the WWW. The genie is out of
the bottle.

>If its an SGML standard don't imagine that it has any relationship to
>HTML. 

Well, HTML *is* SGML (which of course you know), but it is a
particularly poor form of it. As I noted, these are not SGML specific
(see below).

This has got to be the funniest thing I have read all week! Probably
all year! SGML's primary purpose is to define the structure of a document
explicity by defining containers and content model. One cannot define
containers by associating Hn with the following text for 2 reasons:

1) Many people use Hn for font effects
2) One cannot find the boundaries

So I guess your idea works on tag occurence within a document, in
which case, making it look like a path is a mistake because you imply
a heirarchy where there is none.

Tim B-L didn't define the containers (even *LaTeX* has them...) and
now you blame SGML for not being used correctly? When your programs
crash do you swear at the language design? 

----
For people who are not interested in some SGML evangelism, you can
skip the rest.

As I said earlier, unless you are working in the abstractions that the
author uses, one is missing the boat entirely. One of the nice things
about SGML is that it gives one the flexibility to define the
abstractions (if one so wishes), or to simply use the abstractions of
others if they happen to fit. Better, it allows you to define the
information structure explicitly, and then check that the document
actually fits the model you defined.

Now that by itself is useful, but what I think is most useful is that
by marking up a document using well structured SGML, one can actually
turn the document into a database. SGML allows searches to be limited
to one particular region within the document. Think again of the TEI
path:

    /section=1/subsection=2/para=3

This names one element uniquely. We can limit searches to just this
one element if we wish. Now we can make this less specific simply by
removing the numeric qualifiers:

   /section=1/subsection/para=3

This will specify all 3rd paragraphs within all subsections of
section 1.

  /section/subsection/para

This is all paragraphs within all subsections within sections. These
have obvious benefits for searches, or any kind of document
transformation/analysis.

Another area where well structured SGML wins is in automatic TOC
generation. In a well structured SGML document, there is a heirarchy
explicitly define by the DTD. Using that, one can generate TOC's
simply by telling the system which elements should appear in the
TOC. In the example above, we might say that all sections,
subsections, and paragraphs should appear, so when we something like:

  http://foobar.baz.org/foo.html/

we generate a list of all sections. Then when we get something like

 http://foobar.baz.org/foo.html/section=1

we generate a list of subsections within that section.

In DynaWeb, we do precisely this. One can define the depth to which
the TOC's should be generated, and a TOC generation threshold. DynaWeb
takes this even further and allows one to specify multiple TOC
views. For example, you can generate a list of figures, or tables, or
have an "expert" and "amateur" TOC generated automatically *from the
same dataset*

Now SGML *is* coming to the WWW. There are many large corporations and
academic sites that *require* SGML, and the structure it contains. In
fact, you told me that *you* had plans to do an SGML aware browser...

HTML has been tested, and found lacking. There is a concensus that
SGML is needed, and even more, that stylesheets are needed. A MIME
type for SGML is almost ready for the real world, and SGML Open is
committed to creating a stylesheet format based on (the soon to become
ISO standard) DSSSL spec. This spec will be made freely available, as
will an implementation of the stylesheet library. It should be
completed in the next month or so.

Beyond this, I will be *very* surprised if we do not see a full SGML
browser appear within the first half of next year; probaby from some
commercial entity. We already have Panorama, but that is just a first
step toward full SGML browsers. Full SGML browsers will be able to
read HTML as well as any other DTD. When that happens (and providing
the browsers are of sufficient usefulness that they are widely used)
the need for HTML will be diminished. It will continue to have a
place, a large place, within the WWW, but it will not define the WWW
as it does now.

If you think you could possibly stop the many large corporations
around the world who want this, you are very much mistaken. As you so
rightly pointed out, the bottom line is in the RFC's, the IETF, and
most of all, in the hands of users (who vote with their feet shall we
say). The genie is out of the bottle. One cannot cork it again. To try
to do so is arrogance.

This is all rather muddled thinking. The consortium and the organisation are
actually different institutions. The Consortium is a vendors club and the 
organisation a collaboration between MIT and CERN. Actually this is not quite
what they are but despite apperances they are very separate.

The point about the copyrights is that a large number of people are not aware that
many products including Mosaic are built on top of CERN code. This means that
CERN does not get the credit it should and also means that many programmers
are unaware that they can obtain the communications core of a browser and server
from CERN without cost.

When I saw Stallman he was rather concerned about the putting of the libraries in
the public domain and advised the GNU license (what a suprise). Actually the 
GNU public license would not work for CERN since it is an international organisation.

There are two main standards, GIF87 and GIF89. The latter allows graphic control 
extensions, of which one is used extensively on the web - the transparency 
option.

Both flavours let you use interlacing, which is what the MCOM GIFs use on their 
server.

Yes, use pbmplus or rather, use netpbm which is 
<note role="long story">effectively</note> the latest version.

Then you can take file.gif and go

giftoppm file.gif | ppmtobmp > file.bmp

Note that both these programs are in the netpbm distribution not the older 
pbmplus distribution, which is ancient (1991).

> it's been hard to get onto an ftp server that has it.

To help find local mirrors, and for further information, here is the README for 
netpbm followed by the file Netpbm which describes the changes in the netpbm 
release compared to the pbmplus release.

=== included file: netpbm/README =====================

                           N E T P B M
                     Release 7 December 1993

Netpbm is a toolkit for conversion of images between a variety of
different formats, as well as to allow a few basic image operations.
The package is intended to be portable to many platforms. It has been
tested under UNIX (BSD and SYSV, e.g. SGI, Sun4, Sun386i, DEC and
Apollo DN 3500), VMS and Amiga OS. There are also compiler directives
in it for MS-DOS.

You'll find the latest release of Netpbm at the following sites:
* wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4),
  directory /graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
* ikaros.fysik4.kth.se (130.237.35.2), directory /pub/netpbm.
* ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de (134.106.1.9). This site also carries
  binaries for the Amiga.
* peipa.essex.ac.uk (155.245.115.161), directory ipa/src/manip
* ftp.rahul.net (192.160.13.1), directory /pub/davidsen/source
* ftp.cs.ubc.ca, directory /ftp/archive/netpbm

You'll also find a mirror site at the BBS:
* sixhub.tmr.com in the "source" area.

Netpbm is based on the widely spread Pbmplus package (release: 10 Dec 91).
On top of that, a lot of improvements and additions have been made. After
the latest release of Pbmplus, a lot of additional filters have been
circulating on the net. The aim of Netpbm was, to collect these and to turn
them into a package. This work has been performed by a group of program-
mers all over the world. If *you* have some code to add, please contact us,
and we will incorporate it. There is a mailing list for discussions about
Netpbm. You post a message to the list by writing to "netpbm@fysik4.kth.se".
If you want to be on the list, please contact the list administrator,
"oliver@fysik4.kth.se".

Please note, that this is not an official Pbmplus release. The code in
this release is merely a collection of code from various sources around
the world. Not all of the new code parts follow the high standard of
programming of Pbmplus. We have tried to make the code portable to as
many systems as possible, but we haven't cleaned up all routines. We hope
that this release will help the many users of Pbmplus to upgrade their
code all in one piece, instead of having to hunt down different code
fragments at different sites around the world. We also hope, that our
effort will help the author of Pbmplus, Jef Poskanzer, to make a new
official release soon.

The file Netpbm lists all new featues and functions in netpbm.

Below this line follows the original README file from Pbmplus.

***************************************************************


                  Extended Portable Bitmap Toolkit
                      Distribution of 10dec91
                   Previous distribution 30oct91


PBMPLUS is a toolkit for converting various image formats to and from
portable formats, and therefore to and from each other.  The idea is,
if you want to convert among N image formats, you only need 2*N
conversion filters, instead of the N^2 you would need if you wrote each
one separately.

In addition to the converters, the package includes some simple tools
for manipulating the portable formats.

The package is broken up into four parts.  First is PBM, for bitmaps (1
bit per pixel).  Then there is PGM, for grayscale images.  Next is PPM,
for full-color images.  Last, there is PNM, which does content-independent
manipulations on any of the three internal formats, and also handles
external formats that have multiple types.

The parts are upwards compatible: PGM reads both PGM and PBM files and
writes PGM; PPM reads all three and writes PPM; and PNM reads all three
and writes, usually, the same type as it read.  Whenever PNM makes an
exception and "promotes" a file to a higher format, it lets you know.


INSTALLATION

    Unpack the files.
    If you have the TIFF library (./libtiff) and are going to use it, copy the
      appropriate Makefile into place, read the comments in libtiff/README,
      and edit libtiff/tiffconf.h or the Makefile to reflect your compiler and
      options.
    Decide whether you want to use Imakefiles or Makefiles.  If you want
      to use Makefiles:

	Edit the top-level Makefile, find each line with the string
	  "CONFIGURE", and follow the directions for setting configuration
	  options.
	Likewise edit pbmplus.h.
	If you are using gnu make, you have to edit *all* the Makefiles
	  and remove all the imake stuff at the ends, otherwise gnu make
	  will overwrite the Makefiles.
	Make.
	When you're happy that things compiled ok, make install.
    
    If you want to use Imakefiles:

	Edit Pbmplus.tmpl, find each line with the string "CONFIGURE",
	  and follow the directions for setting configuration options.
	Likewise edit pbmplus.h.
	Save the original Makefiles, in case you later want to switch back
	  to using them.
	The usual X11 sequence of xmkmf, make Makefiles, make depend, then
	  make should work. If you have the TIFF libraries, the second step
	  should be "make SUBDIRS='./pbm ./pgm ./ppm ./pnm' Makefiles".
	When you're happy that things compiled ok, make install and
	  make install.man.

After installing the manual pages, you may want to create the "whatis"
file by doing a catman -w -M <directory>, or whatever the equivalent is
on your system.


SUPPORT

I've tested this stuff under SysV and BSD, on Sun 3's 4's and 386's and
Sequents and Vaxen and HPs, with cc and gcc.  Nevertheless, I'm sure bugs
remain, and portability to systems like Amigas and IBM compatibles is
an interesting question.  Feedback is welcome; send bug reports,
enhancements, etc. to this address:

    jef@well.sf.ca.us
    apple!well!jef

When sending bug reports, always include the output from running any
PBMPLUS program with the -version flag.  Also include the type of
system you are on, what compiler you used, and whether you are using
Makefiles or Imakefiles.  I try to respond to bug reports and enhancements
promptly; say, within a week.

Also, if there is a new format or feature you would like to have added
to the package, feel free to drop me a line.  If it's a format, include
whatever documentation you have, and if possible a uuencoded sample.
My response time will depend on how busy I am, and how easy the job
looks.  If you need it right away, or it's a complicated job, you might
consider paying me; lately, that's how a lot of work on the package has
gotten done.

Finally, if you have access to Usenet, there's a newsgroup called
alt.graphics.pixutils which is specifically for discussion of image
conversion and editing packages such as PBMPLUS.  Posting stuff there
is even better than mailing it to me, since it lets other people help
out with the answers.


HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT CONVERTER

Some people get confused by all the different names.  If you want to
convert a pbm file to a Sun raster file, is it pbmtorast, pgmtorast,
ppmtorast, or pnmtorast?  In this case some of the confusion might be
because previous versions of the package did in fact have both
pbmtorast and ppmtorast.  But mostly it's just too many different
things to hold in your short term memory.  Fine, so don't even try to
remember what's what.  That's what computers are for.  Unix, at least
BSD Unix, has this great indexing feature on the "man" program.  You
say "man -k <keyword>" and it gives you all the one-line descriptions
with that keyword in them.  All the PBMPLUS man pages have nice useful
one-line descriptions, that mention all the relevant keywords.  Try it,
you'll like it.


COPYRIGHTS

All the software in this package, whether by me or by a contributer,
has a copyright similar to this one:

    Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
    documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided
    that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that both that
    copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting
    documentation.  This software is provided "as is" without express or
    implied warranty.

Many people get confused by this legalese, especially the part about
"without fee".  Does this mean you can't charge for any product that
uses PBMPLUS?  No.  All it means is that you don't have to pay me.
You can do what you want with this software.  Build it into your
package, steal code from it, whatever.  Just be sure to let people
know where it came from.

Not to jump on the flamewagon, but the original concept -- be it frames, 
sections, containers, whatever -- would also mean a finer level of 
granularity if you wanted to have locking for group editing, or 
versioning for revision control, etc.  If that is via an HTML construct, 
an SGML construct, fine (sound of Paul, ducking the controversy).

I love the talk being generated about structured documents.  I hate the
fact that current httpd's are file-based, and we are rolling out one that
is based on a persistent object store.  Being able to reference via URL
(w/out CGI-type URL hacking) any part of that object would be, err, nice.

I'm not sure that's a plus. If a NetScape user stops a transmission simply
to abort graphics load, but stll has received my text, I'd consider that
a 'completed' transaction for access log purposes....

I have to agree with Nick.  Last year I developed a gateway to a UniSQL
database, to which Verity's "Photo Search Demo" bears many similarities.
A prototype is usually running at:

	<URL:http://abelard.mit.edu/cgi-bin/museum-entrance/>

Unfortunately, it lacked a full-text engine and the usefulness of 
such a feature was quickly obvious.  (Although several people have
been interested in buying the capability from us anyway.)

We are currently developing server technology that integrates database
and full-text engines for searching indexes of both local and remote
data.  The current design DOES use Sybase.  However, it is also cgi-based.
I would be interested in hearing more discussion of "server dream
features" that require a non-cgi approach. What did you have in mind?

I would think that accurate platform independent color reproduction
should be the main priority. For many kinds of commercial sales
(clothing, flowers, etc) color reproduction is key.

Now, obviously, there is no pancea for this problem (different displays
have different color gamuts, and even the background surrounding the
CRT display can effect color appearance)

But standards such as CIE LAB and TEK HVS are at least steps in the
right direction.

Hi Phil,

I have some Germans coming to Geneva for a meeting on the 28th.

These are the ones who are porting the CL-HTTP server to the MAC
and also IBM PC.

I need to give them instructions on how to meet me and where to stay.

Can you suggest a hotel near CERN?

I'd like to introduce them to some of the CERN team. The connection may
be useful both ways.

Well HyTime is a different kettle of fish altogether... and serves a
different purpose to SGML.

No. Not following the standard means that you actually do something
that is illegal. Most implementors of SGML parsers instead restrict
themselves to something very close to the "minimal" SGML defined in
section 15 of the standard. In other words, they chose a *conforming*
subset. Standards work because they define a framework in which to
work. Simple standards get implemented fully, complicated standards
often do not, but rather set the boundaries for implementors. 

>That being the case what should be done is to take the standard and

True. I am certainly not alone in thinking that SGML is a "good
thing", and I am certainly not alone in wishing it was not defined by
a lawyer! SGML is not perfect, and it carries a lot of excess baggage,
but the core concepts are excellent, and even better, they bring about
real benefits in the real world.

Now, I must apologise to everyone for using the term "standard" in
relation to TEI. The TEI spec is not a standard, but is rather a well
thought out, and rigorously defined SGML application, targeted toward
academia, and in particular, humanities. Despite this, I think the TEI
work deserves some attention (and I am not active in the TEI in any
way). Let's place it on the "heavily recommended reading" list, and
pray that one day, the people using the TEI guidelines will be able to
make their
 data available to the WWW.

Ah. It sounds to me like you *are* wondering how you can implement an
SGML parser :-) Actually, SGML isn't all that bad if you restrict
yourself to minimal SGML as defined in the standard. I have never
pretended there was a "simple" SGML, but there are certainly
"reasonable" subsets (TEI).

>If TEI are willing to send me a copy of their specification without

I'm not sure where you can get a postscript version from. You can find
some TEI information at ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/TEI but you'll
have to piece it together. The grammars for their
 subset are there
anyway.

We use part of it in DynaText and DynaWeb (specifically, we make the
TEI path spec available).

TEI is largely academic. It was defined so that humanities groups
could share a common base. There are a substantial number of people
following the TEI guidelines with even more substantial databases that
just scream to be made available....

Let's look at this again:

   http://foobar.org/fred.fish.html#H1:3,H2:4,H3:7,P:8

OK. Perhaps "incorrect" is too strong. I take it you *are* using
occurences within the document as a numeric qualifier, otherwise it
certainly *is* incorrect, because you simply do not have the
structure.  

Now, given that we have occurences as the qualifier, I have 2 problems
with your scheme.

Problem #1
   It implies a hierarchy that is not there. Due to the fact that we
   have no containers (or few of them) in HTML, your addressing scheme
   has no need at all for the Hxxx's because the P is *not* contained
   by them, so the 8 in P:8 *must* be an occurence counter which means
   that 

      http://foobar.org/fred.fish.html#P:8 

   does just as well! What is even more interesting is that if we
   rewrite it slightly 

      http://foobar.org/fred.fish.html#P=8 

         or perhaps

      http://foobar.org/fred.fish.html/P=8 

   we have a TEI path! Now I have already pointed out that you
   *cannot* fake containers by associating text with the preceding
   header because your beloved common usage (font effects) kills you
   one way, and the HTML content model kills you the other (you cannot
   discern container ends). Again, I will emphasise that these types
   of names are *not* SGML specific! LaTeX has more structure than
   HTML, and RTF has about the same!

Problems #2
   Your proposal tries to accomplish the same thing as a set of
   guidelines in use by large data repositories in academia, but with
   trivial syntax differences. Why not use what's already there.

So yes, assuming you do use occurence counting, I was wrong, and I
apologise. Your proposal is not incorrect, merely meaningless.

Except that this TEI scheme bears no relationship to HTML and you so not

you apply one through a defining a separate sepantics for the tags. This
is all well and good but you then have only positioning for the semantic

This is not "Not Invented Here" but "Other Suggestion Non-Starter". I somehow
don't thi9nk that TEI proposed the scheme in the context you intend to
apply it. Again references please.

By poorly designed I suppose you mean it didn't happen to conform to

Given the SGML spec HTML is probably the best you can do from a very poorly

A circumlocuitous way of saying that SGML fails at its pricipal design purpose.
I quite agree. Many of the claims made for SGML are hubris. There are some
communities within the SGML camp wsuch as the ICADD people who are there
because it is the closest thing to a structural markup arround. What I 
see as the danger though is people looking at SGML noting the lossage and
concluding that structural markup is a bad idea. This has happened before on
filesystems where people have looked at the MVS/VM lossage and concluded that
structured filesystems are a bad idea and in programming languages where
Wirth set the field back years with the botched Pascal spec which took strong
typing to the point where arrays of different lengths were intrinsically
different types.

Its easy enough to define the boundaries. If people engage in Mosaic
tag-abuse they end up losers, so what? Their documents light up the bad HTML
flag on more modern browsers and eventually the users get educated.

The tree structure may be deduced using a simple set of rules aince at the top
level within the BODY container the only valid elements are <Hn>, <P>, <UL>
<DL>, <OL>, <PRE> and <IMG>. The <Hn> elements are the only ones which define
structure within the tree and all the others may be regarded simply as different
types of paragraph.

|>Tim B-L didn't define the containers (even *LaTeX* has them...) and

I blame SGML for having the most incomprehensible structure definition
grammar since sendmail and still not allowing the structure to be effectively
represented.

In other words not all documents are divided into chapters or sections. 
This is why an untagged indexing scheme has to operate on the tags used
for the markup.

Quite true. This is one reason why I am more aware than most of the scale
of SGML lossage.

The main reason why it won't fit in the bottle being of course that the life

vote with their feet, hello Microsoft Word 6.0.

First, I should clarify that I'm suggesting that a combination of
relational and full-text (inverted index, etc.) models does more than
either one alone can do.  They're optimized for quite different performance
characteristics.

I didn't mean to imply that our engine, or anyone else's, can achieve the
kind of field search performance that a relational database does.

One of our guys, Dave Glazer, wrote a paper for the WWW conference, in
which he talks about why we chose to build an integrated server instead of
going the CGI route.  It's at
<URL:http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/IT94/Proceedings/HCI/glazer/glazer.html>.

One of our competitors in the Web arena built a server by linking their
search engine to HTTPd via CGI scripts written in Perl.  It got them to
market quickly, but I can't imagine that Perl is going to perform or scale
the way that a C coded integrated server will.  I'd be a bit nervous about
basing a commercial server on Perl, in any event, just because it's not a
real commercial product itself.

Of course, I'm not assuming that they're not busy re-coding in C.

As far as ideas, we'd love to be able to directly work with the database
files, but that's a hard one to crack.  We're more likely to adopt some
sort of brokering approach, where queries are executing in parallel, rather
than passing through gateways.

Subject: Should <img> exist at all?
content-length: 837

It strikes me that <img> is a very limiting concept and not in keeping
with either the generalized attribute mechanisms available in HTML or
the philosophy of providing multi-platform, multi-capability support.

In particular, the use of something like:

	<a href="...." inline=true>Alternative HTML</a>

would provide a much more flexible model.  Any type that
is defined could potentially be inlined, and a viewer that was
not capable of inlining the document would have the option of the
displaying the alternative and/or giving the user a chance to
display it externally.  Alternatives could even potentially
recurse, although I'm not sure that's a _positive_ feature.

Further attributes could extend the model even further:
	<a href="...foo.au" repeat=10>Alternative HTML</a>
could allow background music, for instance.

As of the 2.0 alpha 7 release, it did not.  AIR Mosaic and Emacs-w3 do, in 
addition to NetScape.  I don't know about Cello and WinWeb.

OK, no complaints from me about that one.

Some things to throw into the pot, mainly about TIFF which, in spite of being an 
industry standard with considerable commercial "taint" was open to public review 
and is one of the most capable multiplatform standards around. I have prefixed 
each snippet with the precise image format or topic that I am talking about 
which looks a little wooden but helps when my posting gets resampled into little 
bits in other postings;-)
 

- Baseline TIFF 6 has x resolution and y resolution tags, which could be 
  used to trigger resampling at the client so images were the specified 
  size regardless of client resolution. This would need to be author 
  selectable on a per-link basis because in some situations you definitely 
  do want this behaviour, in others you definitely don't, and in the rest
  you don't care either way.

- Baseline TIFF 6 has some other handy tags which a browser could extract, throw 
  into a document generated on the fly, and display a link to beside the 
  image. Things like Artist, DateTime, HostComputer, ImageDescription, 
  Software are all handy things to know in some cases without having to 
  save the file to disk and running Sam Leffler's  tiffinfo over it.

- Extended TIFF 6 spec has an LAB type which clearly gives pretty much 
  device independent colour within the inherent limits of the CIE standard. 
  I am aware of those, but even to get decent CIE display would be a big 
  step forward.

- Extended TIFF 6 has calibrated RGB space support with tags for primary
  chromaticities, whitepoint and gamma and even transfer functions if you 
  want to really do things properly. Oh and reference BlackWhite for headroom
  and footroom.

- Extended TIFF 6 has CMYK image support with InkSet (CMYK or not!!), 
  InkNames (I suggest that these should specify the exact ink and 
  environment that the separation was generated for, eg SWOP on coated stock, 
  as there is nowhere else to put this information), DotRange and TargetPrinter
  which describes the "printing environment". Whether this means the 
  phototypesetter that the separations are to be printed on, or the printing
  press, or both is unspecified. But then, people don't tweak dot gain to
  compensate for miscalibrated imagesetters in this day and age, do they ;-P )

- Extended TIFF 6 supports YCbCr images which is also device independent
  although not covering the full device gamut. I know, it can but in practice
  this type is used for shuttling video images around so the gamut is less even
  than RGB. Plus you get spatial subsampling on the chrominance channels so
  there is information loss there too.

- Lastly, Extended TIFF 6 has associated alpha handling (hooray) which would 
  at last allow proper antialiased graphics with transparency, without having 
  to guess what the client's background colour is to antialias too. This would
  be heaps better than the current GIF89 fudge.

- Printing: wide deployment of Level 2 PostScript printers which claim to 
  be able to accept images in LAB or XYZ and use internal tables to generate 
  an accurate representation on paper should in theory mean that decent 
  images could also be printed off while retaining reasonable appearance. 
  I would be most interested if someone could point me at a review of current
  dye sub printes which have printed out, say, a Macbeth chart and actually
  measured the thing to see if the colours are anywhere near their claimed
  values. If anyone from Tektronics or Kodak would care to spring to the 
  defence of their companies' products with some hard figures, please feel free.

- Photoshop (2.5.1 and up): are there any apps that can read and display these
  files apart from the implementations of Photoshop on Mac, PC, and the various
  Unix platforms it has bravely been ported to?

- Photoshop (2.5.1 and up):We need a MIME type for Photoshop files (would 
  that be image or application, I wonder) so people can put up files with 
  all the extra channels intact and exchange them.

- Content type negotiation: Just in case this should ever become a reality, we
  need some way to disable it on a link by link basis so that a medical grade
  image of someones insides or a commercial grade image does not get converted
  to GIF and back, transparently, by some helpful proxy that was only trying 
  to save you net.bandwidth

- X11R5 and up: X servers claim to have a colour management system. Don't 
  get your hopes up. This is described in The X resource, issue 0, Fall 1991.   
  Briefly, it claims to convert colour specifications between colour models,
  including CIE ones; to perform colour adjustment due to differences 
  between the white point the X application thinks it has and the white 
  point the screen actually has (!) and to do gamut mapping for out of 
  gamut colours. I was sure there was a demo called Xcmstest but I don't 
  seem to find it on our HP systems right now. It did a conversion all 
  right, but assumed an NTSC broadcast monitor which it patently does not 
  have and which is wildly unrepresentative of modern monitors anyway. This 
  is of course, more a criticism of the particular implementation that the
  underlying concept. Oh, and I got the same results playing with an SGI, 
  too. Make that two implementations. 

- X11R6: Not played with this, anyone got comments on R6isms that would
  be helpful in this context?

- X11R5 and up with Level 2 DPS: Supposedly this would let you display CIE
  defined colours but how an X application can know about the properties 
  of the monitor it is displaying on, short of using Xcms (discussed above)
  beats me. I suspect a naff conversion with the dreaded NTSC phosphors 
  again, totally useless if so. Unable to test this as our SGI is sulking and 
  our HP workstations, wonderful as they are in other ways, don't even come 
  with a level 1 DPS never mind a level 2.

> Now, obviously, there is no pancea for this problem (different displays

I knew that throwaway line about stylesheets describing how to handle gamut 
alarms was a mistake ;-)

Perhaps stylesheets could specify a background colour ("wheat", no, I jest) so 
for important images the HTML page could specify a stylesheet with a neutral 
grey at, say, D50 or D65 as the background.

Gamut mapping is clearly an important issue as evidenced by the fact that no-one 
has satisfactorily solved it yet.

Agree, although last I looked Tek HVS was just the polar form of CIE LUV, 
LCuvH with the x axis pointing at a particular "best red" and some scaling 
thrown in. No disrespect to the knowledgeable folks at Tektronics intended, 
but I don't see that Tek HVC really buys you much.

Pardon? I was under the impression that HyTime was a set of architectural forms 
for SGML that grey out of a desire to express musical notation in SGML. In which 
case it is hardly a different kettle of fish.

If I am wrong in my understanding, I would welcome corrections.

Since the text and the graphics load are seen as separate transactions, your
scenario would result in the text delivery being successfully logged and the
graphics load would generate a "connection broken" message.

The Windows Web server (and other servers as well) don't care what's inside
a document, other than maybe to decide what KIND of document it is, so it
can tell the client. If you are having problems making transparent GIFs
work, it is probably somewhere other than in the server.

I don't know what P H-B means by "lossage" wrt to SGML markup.
But as for TEI resources on the Web, I have (possibly stale)
URLs as follows:
        http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/teip3files.html
        http://www.oulu.fi/TEI.html
        http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html
        http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html

There will certainly be documents marked up in accordance with
TEI on the Web soon after Panorama becomes available.  I would 
also expect to see documents marked up in accordance with 
ISO 12083 (formerly AAP), Docbook, IBMIDDoc, and other DTDs
at about the same time.

Indeed, some may choose to rename their HTML files with .sgml
filename extensions so as to present HTML through Panorama
(and similar browsers soon to follow) while taking advantage
of their style sheet mechanisms.

That they POST the requests for IMGs in the results of a POST method.
You're going what does he mean?  This is what I belive is
happening:

	A user enters a CGI script and does a POST to submit it.  
	A resulting HTML document is returned, containing new
	icon images, which the browser does then _incorrectly_
	does a POST to retrive those images.

This is my only theory.

Has anyone else seen this, or can somebody quantify it better.

Thanks

The paper was delivered by other people from Softsource - the CAD company
proposing Simple Vector Format (SVF) and its incorporation into WWW. The
paper was generally very well received. 

The proposal shows support for in-line vector files which can be zoomed
and panned, layers switched on and off to prevent clutter and mis-use as
you zoom in, regions of layers defined as hotlinks, local actions defined
- all at the client-side.

This is very important for many areas though I too feel that it is critical
for Geographic Information Systems.  We have been building all sorts of
workarounds to imagemap and raster files.

As I understand it, DXF is simply a drawing exchange file and does not
have enough structure to do the job.  I think that it lacks the topology
to have objects such as polygons and, most importantly, it has no way to 
define a region as a hotlink to some URL.

The uproar from the audience was more along the lines of "Why not use
Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) rather than create yet another format".

Such things would be very nice to have, it was part of the
basis of my <IF ...> markup.  Though instead of overloading
the present <A ...> tag, it would be better to create a new 
tag:
	<IMBED HREF="..." TYPE="mime type information" ...>
		Alternate content
	</IMBED>
This way if your browser didn't fetch the object it could
know what kind of object it was (display that audio icon).
Or pre-create a movie player "shell".  

I would like the ability to _mix_ document formats, have
HTML documents contain RTF and PDF along with audio and
video.

--koblas@netcom.com

ps. It should be defined to recurse...
    It would allow for an easy way to create "open on the fly"
    menus, where the lists of objects inside were in an IMBED tag.

HyTime is a different kettle of linking mechanisms from almost
anything proposed so far for use in HTML.  You can have SGML without
HyTime, and HTML in fact employs a method of linking (URLs) that is
not HyTime conformant but (I think) much more flexible and easy
to use.

So HyTime is not at issue in this discussion of whether SGML is
any use at all for the description of HTML.

Hmm... I think you're right (I can see how this would have happened), however
with some restructuring in AIR Mosaic in the next release (coming soon), that 
will no longer happen.  Definitely a nasty bug, just not one that turns up to 
often, I guess.

I can confirm that this is definately what WinMosaic 2.0 Alpha x does - 
it was such a stumbling block for us that we changed the NCSA HTTPD 1.3 
source to change POST requests for *.gif into GET requests.

I think what [lost attribution] was talking about
are things like, DATATAG, #CURRENT attribute declared
values, CONCUR, empty start tags, and so on.  These are 
optional features:  people either don't use them (empty
start tags, #CURRENT) or don't implement them (DATATAG, CONCUR)
because of their limited utility.  No SGML applications or
software that I know of willingly *violate* the standard (except for
WWW documents and browsers, and that's more from ignorance than 
intent.)

No, TEI is just an example of a very well-thought-out
SGML application.  It's completely ISO 8879 compliant.
You shouldn't read it *instead of ISO 8879*, you should
read it *instead of reinventing the wheel*.  (I would
suggest checking out IBM ID DOC and InfoMaster, too; 
there's a lot of good ideas in there as well.)

TEI is being used on the Web.  (Sorry, no URL.

It's not a commercial endeavor; all the TEI

Since it's one of the more significant advances

I'm sure the IETF *will* give it some weight..

Strawman.  Guess the likely ratio of Microsoft

in a few month's time.  Does that make RTF

Ad hominem attack.  (Besides, if you had *looked* at the

Misdirection.  There are plenty of SGML applications that
work much better than HTML, and plenty of working SGML
applications that took far less than a year to complete,
and (I hazard a guess) the intersection of those two

Existential quantification fallacy.  SGML allows
you to describe document structure and semantics
to any level of detail.  The original authors of
the HTML DTD simply did not do so.

OK, there you have a point.  It's one I don't agree with,
though:  I personally don't have any trouble at all reading
or writing DTDs, and I've yet to come across a document
structure that couldn't be effectively represented in SGML.

This is already covered pretty well in HTML 3.0's <IMAGE> tag I believe.

Also, link relationships are covered under the REL and REV attributes;
though I'm not sure what is up in the area at the moment (Hopefully
Arena will support them).

Subject: Overlaying inline images
content-length: 1604

Some of the planetary scientists here have been asking me to extend my
Mars Atlas (http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/Atlas/Mars/)
to include optional overlays, so that coutour lines, place names, or both
can be displayed on top of the image maps.  With the current version of HTML,
that can only be done by having four sets of images (one plain, one with
contour lines, one with place names, and one with both).  If N overlays are
available instead of just two, it quickly becomes infeasible, requiring 2^N
sets of images.  (In theory the server could run a script to combine them, but
that isn't feasible here, and it would be very CPU intensive.)

Is there any chance that browsers in the future can be made to accept some
kind of overlay markup, specifying that two or more transparent GIF images of
the same size and shape should be displayed one on top of another as one
inline image?

It would also be nice to have a similar syntax that specifies that the first
image should be displayed by itself, and a control should be inserted next to
it that flips to the next image.  This would be useful for flipping between
visible and infrared in an orbital image, skeleton and muscle in an anatomy
drawing, and so on.  I'm not suggesting inline MPEG capability (which would
soon tempt every organization to have a flying logo on its home page).  Each
frame would be a separate file (probably GIF), and the second frame need only
be downloaded if the user requests it.

Unless I am extraordinarily dense, doesn't your scheme refer to a
single character or possibly element within a document? Isn't a
character an object? If you are talking about the difference between
one being a fragment ID, and the other a URL, well, you could just as
easily make the TEI path part of a fragment ID. If you mean that I
have not shown how one might refer to a single character, then it is
easily solved by something like:

 ../fred.html/section=2/subsection=4/subsubsection=3/P=4/PCDATA=nnn

(depending on the content model), though I'm not sure it's all that
useful, whereas I am sure that accessing, and managing data at the
element level *is* useful.

Now, the reason I think it is better as a URL is because it defines a
*path* to the element, in the same way that normal URL's are a *path*
to the document. The benefit is much like that found in using
heirarchical file systems over flat filesystems. I'm sure no-one
want's to go back to the MSDOS 1.0 or CPM file systems...

I should note that there is an increasing trend to move away from
physical paths (ie. 1 to 1 mapping between URL and file), and this is
just one example of it. One advantage of the TEI scheme, which I have
repeated time and time again, is that <h1>They are not SGML
specific</h1> whereas your model is.

Perhaps you are just pretending to not understand? When I use
"section" and "subsection" I *obviously* am not referring to HTML. In
fact, in my last posting I explained that HTML was a degenerate case
because it is "flat" (ie. it is represented as a very shallow
heirarchy in which order is not well specified). I showed that the TEI
paths can be used for HTML (and showed that in the final anaylsis,
your proposal and TEI are the same), but I have repeatedly said that
the real benefit is with more structured datasets. In other words, the
TEI paths represent a *superset* of the functionality that you desire,
that can be used on *any* heirarchical data system. This whole
"doesn't apply to HTML" is a smokescreen because anything that applies
to SGML applies to HTML, because HTML *is* SGML (just a particularly
poor form of it. I should note that HTML 2.0, and HTML 3.0, thanks to
the hard work of Dave Ragget and Dan O'Connolly, are getting better
and better).

You are probably correct in saying that the TEI probably never
envisaged the TEI paths being used in URL's, but they certainly wanted
to use them to retrieve parts of large documents.

No. By poorly designed I mean that he ignored (or probably simply

both structural markup, and the concept of working in the author's
mindset, and instead defined another TROFF.

I tell you what. Go to a large aerospace company and tell them that
SGML is a waste of time. Tell them to mark up the 500,000 to
1,000,000 pages of technical documentation they have using HTML for use
in IETM's. There are *gigabytes* of mission critical SGML data around
the world, and probably a gigabyte of HTML. Compare the content,
compare the purpose of the documents, compare the authors. Then
perhaps you will understand why SGML *is* coming to the WWW.

It is very easy to sneer at things you do not understand. 
I'll let you in on a little secret. People do best what they
understand most (or usually anyway). These people have a huge amount
of experience with markup and document processing. Did Tim B-L? Do
you? You would be *amazed* at the technical skills needed to maintain
large document repositories. In addition, some(many?) TEI people also
happen to be SGML experts (by choice, or because they saw that SGML
was required, and spent time understanding it. Very admirable if you
ask me...)

This verges on the ridiculous. HTML is close to the *worst* one can do
with SGML. The reason it took close to a year to get a formal HTML DTD
is because most WWW people did not understand SGML (starting with the
original designer of HTML), and because they gave almost no thought to
SGML when they designed it. Again, do you blame your computer langauge
of choice when your programs crash? ("God C is a crock! Why doesn't it
have automatic array index checking? Why doesn't it detect NULL
pointers? Why doesn't it have a counted string type?")

Ha ha ha ha. You'll have me in stiches yet! <H1>Wrong!</H1>
In SGML one defines containers to contain things. I guess if you don't
do that, then you can't expect to have any containers! I wouldn't say
that's SGML's fault though...

Now compare the SGML and HTML markups.

<html>                    <sgml>
<h1>Section 1</h1>        <section>
                          <title>Section 1</title>
.....                     ......
<h2>Section 2</h2>        <subsection>
                          <title>Section 2</title>
                          </subsection>
                          </section>
</html>                   </sgml>

We can immediately see 2 things:
1) The SGML tends to be more verbose because it has more tags.
2) The boundaries between elements is easily found in the SGML, but
   one *cannot* deduce the heirarchy from the HTML document. 

The key difference is this: HTML was designed with presentation and a
linear document structure in mind, whereas (good) SGML emphasizes
hierarchical structure, or at least, tries to say *what* something is
rather than how it looks.

>|>One cannot define
>|>containers by associating Hn with the following text for 2 reasons:

Some will applaud your sentiments, some will call it arrogance. At
least the SGML people propose a backwardly compatible
solution... people will abuse tags *because the orginal HTML
was so badly designed*. The tools for restricting tag use were there,
but they were not used. Don't curse the tools now.

Which HTML spec are you referring to? Unless it has changed
considerably since I last looked, <Hn> could occur within an <A> which
could occur almost anywhere. In addition, there is no way to enforce
using H1 before using H2, because they all occur at the same elevel
within the heirarchy defined in the DTD. This means you cannot
reliably find the end of the (faked!) container without building in
HTML version specific information into you parser, and even then,
you'd find cases where you would fail. What if someone does
something like the following?

   <h3>Big</>
   <h2>Bigger</>
   <h1>Biggest</>

I don't pretend that the TEI paths can do any more than access parts
of documents by element. I certainly don't claim that it can put
structure where there is none. 

>I blame SGML for having the most incomprehensible structure definition
>grammar since sendmail and still not allowing the structure to be effectively
>represented. 

The only thing which really confused me was groups. Apart from that,
it's just YACC on steroids. Now I would *love* to see some examples of
where it is impossible to define the structure of some document using
SGML. I will concede that there is one area where I found SGML to be
lacking: one cannot define the format of the character data. What this
means is that for things like phone numbers, you cannot say "this data
is 3 numbers followed by a dash followed by 4 numbers". This might be
very useful, because one could do data verification, thereby making it
much more suitable for database work.

>In other words not all documents are divided into chapters or sections. 

No, and I never claimed they were. The example I showed using
"section" and "subsection" showed the use of tag names (any tag names
are fine).

I'm sorry, I don't understand this sentence.

I think most people go through stages when dealing with SGML. Most CS
types go through a stage I'll call "I could have done it better", in
which they are aghast at the baroque syntax, and the context-sensitive
parser. In most cases, I'd agree. I had the same thoughts, but then I
also looked at how people were using it, and it makes much more
sense. The TEI subset of SGML is parseable using YACC and flex, and
provides a very good minimum. Take a look at it. People using SGML
will not accept HTML, but they would probably accept the TEI subset as
a common base for document exchange.

Which can now also read/write SGML. Yes, Microsoft thinks SGML is
important too. Hello? Smell the tea?

>Phillip M. Hallam-Baker
>Not Speaking for anyone else.

Thank goodness. I have every respect for you in some technical areas,
but in large scale document processing and SGML, I think I might have
found an area that "needs more work", shall we say. Your proposal
cannot work, SGML is not evil, HTML is poor for large
documentation/database projects, TEI paths are great for accessing
parts of heirarchical documents, and I have spent far too much time on
this already. These are facts. Please give me good, solid, technical
reasons for 

1) Why TEI paths are not superior to your scheme, and indeed a
   superset of it.
2) Why SGML is so evil and braindamaged, and why HTML is king.
3) How you could possibly make your scheme fly (how to find
   boundaries) 

Or even better, show me *code* that works. As you said "Code! General
Consensus! Working Implementation".

Ab-so-lutely. I have been the butt of many bug accusations (Windows Web

obvious. And IMHO it is a serious bug. I cannot believe it is in so many
browsers, though.

This is also important on monitors. The big problems are the degree of
user control over the parameters at client end, user ignorance about
viewing and display conditions, background illumination.
The colour of an object depends on the texture of the surface, the 
reflectance and adsorption of the surface, the angle of incidence of
the light source AND viewer, and the spectrum of the light source.
( I know you all know this, but someone out there may not ! )
All of these generate problems. Texture is obvious. Most colours
which people wish to represent on the screen are originally adsorption
based ( mostly ), whereas screens are emmision based ( and non-linear ).
This causes another mapping problem. The angle of incidence is 
essentially uncontrollable, as is the spectra of the light source. 
Any file format which wishes to produce a 'true' representation of
a colour should be capable of specifing all of these at 'preferred' values -
however, there are so many different ( and conflicting ) specifications
of colour spaces and colour transformation equations that this is
almost impossible.

Copyright and distribution rights ( and PGP authentication of content ? )
are notable ommissions here. As well as organisation, keywords, and
a generic 'comments' field to really screw up standardisation !
This would also be nice to be able to encapsulate, so that source 1
supplies a content authenticated image to source 2, who then encapsulate 
it with additional meta-information with overall content authentication
without having to affect the auth info on the original image.

We found that a number of companies we were suppling to ( in my previous
job ) were not happy with CIE-LAB for colour representation on screen.
Particularly car paint manufactures, who have a high gloss on the 
final surface. I suppose what I'm really trying to say, is that colour
representation is less important than 'appearance' representation.

Agreed. There is also the problem that in digitised images of any type, 
the backgound is not often uniform - black translates to about 48 shades
when digitising from our videodisk via a TARGA board. The noise inherent in
the system makes automatic background detection difficult. We rely on 
a combination of thresholding and spatial frequency analysis to do this, 
with some success. It is however a bit slow ;-(

I think this will also depend on the company producing consistant dyes,
and the customer always buying from the same supplier. The degree of 
variation we saw between products form different suppliers which were 
*suppose* to be identical was astonishing. Even the varience in one
company's colour was quite extreme. Aging is also a factor here.

I am more inclined to talk about power values at frequencies within a 
10nm spectra.....with the conditions of sampling heavily specified. This
may be converted into CIE et al. , and is the most accurate representation
currently available. The inter-instrument agreement and repeatability
of modern spectrophotometers such as the Machbeth 7000 [ assuming you cut
the earth wire on the serial port to stop the ground loops ;-( ] is quite
good. One company ( I forget the name ) uses a spectro head hung 
in front of the monitor, and one on the printer output, which are used
to calibrate the system every couple of hours. Even then, they still 
have representation problems. ( The company may have been Stork Igs ).

Funny you should say that - have a look at

 <http://www.agocg.ac.uk:8080/agocg/CGM.html> and pages that hang off it. (Oh, 
and comments welcome, I wrote these pages)

But yes, CGM does not have hooks for URLs and so on, nor would it be simple or 
timely to add them. On the other hand, used in an HTML 3 FIG element CGM could 
have hotspots added fairly easily. 

A new format is fine if it does a different job, and if it is possible to 
convert to and from it on multiple platforms. I assume Softsource have addressed 
this issue, and their CAD programs will not be the only software to read and 
write the format.

Have you investigated this or are you just making an assumption? Combined with 
persistent but not indefinite cacheing, the server load need not be espoecially 
great. Using associated alpha for the overlays rather than a separate alpha 
channel would also help on the speed front. If you are prepared to forego 
anti-aliasing, the image combination becomes trivial: one test and a copy per 
pixel.

I agree that it is not a perfect solution, but it is not infeasible unless your 
server is running on something like a Windows PC.

Let us generalise that away from GIF, and say that we require a means of 
registered overlaying of graphics (image or vector or annotation text) with some 
means of controlling the compositing.

I can see no particular technical reason why this could not be implemented. The 
algorithms are well known. The main problems are :


- designing a positional scheme that does not depend on pixels, essential 
  once we get vector formats or resizable image formats in there. I see that 
  the sketch HTML 3 dtd <ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/www/arena/HTML3.DTD.sketch> 
  dated Tue Nov 15 13:40:00 1994 has some measurement in em units, but others
  are in pixels. I would expect this to be cleared up so ems are usable
  throughout. This is needed anyway so that client side hotspots are doable
  with vector images like inline CGM, moline, EPS, whatever.

- declaring the positioning of overlapping graphics in the HTML 3 dtd. Perhaps
  a table element, without borders, would be of value here.

If the Arena team would care to comment I would appreciate it. This seems to 
fulfil a real need that would benefit people in many subject areas.

This insight is one of the motivations for the HTML+ FIG element, which
I am including in the initial draft of HTML 3.0. Full details in a few
days time when I have finished typing them up.

FIG provides for captions, text flow, and a neat way of locally handling
image hotzones, using anchor shape attributes in the alt text. My plan
is to evolve FIG into a mechanism for supporting OLE/OpenDoc style object
embedding. We hope to demonstrate this next year with Arena.

Note: isn't this topic something better discussed on www-html?

I agree that user ignorance is a problem. However the current situation is that 
experienced users are currently unable to shareimages with any sort of colour 
fidelity. Once we have that cracked, making it foolproof for naive users is 
indeed the next step.

Yes and no. We are talking screen display here, not physical objects. We can 
either assume that the light has been modelled correctly to produce the image 
(see, for example, 
<http://info.mcc.ac.uk/CGU/research/raytracing/reflectance.html> or we can 
assume that the image has been satisfactorily colour balanced using something 
like Photoshop and the LAB values are known for each pixel.

The absorption vs emission question is a bit of a red herring in this instance. 
Things we can see give off light. Sometimes this light is generated by the 
object, sometimes it is a modification of light falling on it, often it is both. 
Whatever, things give off light which has a defined spectrum and can thus be 
reduced to an XYZ triple.

That being the case, we can largely ignore the factors you mention except in 
that background illumination falling on the screen affects the light we see 
from the screen. 

The light entering our eyes when viewing an on screen image has three sources:

1) from those phosphors the electron beam is firing at. This we can affect; 
given phosphor chromaticities, whitepoint and transfer functions or gamma we can 
not just affect it but control it.

2) from the phosphors the beam has previously excited, the general dark grey 
glow of a monitor displaying black.

3) from reflected background light. Remember that the monitor image forms the 
primary adaptive stimulus except in cases of very high background illumination, 
when users will notice that they cannot see properly because of glare on the 
screen. So adaptation is helping us here.

2 and 3 are collectively known as the back raster, and can be accounted for in 
accurate XYZ to RGB calculations. See relevant portions of

Oshima, Yuasa, Sakanoshita and Ogata "A CAD system for Color Design of a Car" 
Proceedings Eurographics 92, Computer Graphics Forum 11(3) 1992 pp C-381 - 
C-390.

Unless you have some direct experimental evidence to cite, I think you overstate 
the case. What i want to avoid is a collerctive response of, "oh, this is too 
hard, it is impossible, let's not bother, here is an RGB file".

Well understood solutions do exist that would bring a great improvement over the 
current situation. Let us implement these, and implement them well, and proceed 
from there, rather than give up in despair.

[About specified display sizes for images]
>And a standard for representing the units which these are specified in, 

Yes, absolutely. HTML 3 DTD seems to use ems which is fair enough.

>along with prefered re-sampling method 

That could be left to the client, really. Bicubic interpolation would be fine, 
in whatever colour space the image is expressed in, given the fine granularity 
of an image and the fairly limited resampling that is needed to cope with the 
range of screen resolutions.

> and dither method. 

DITHER!! This is accurate image display we are talking about here. If a client 
is displaying on an 8 bit visual into the standard colour map, whatever dither 
the client chooses will be just fine. Netscape does well here.

> Copyright and distribution rights ( and PGP authentication of content ? )
> are notable ommissions here.

Perhaps you misunderstand. I am not producing a catalogue of indexing terms 
which I think all images should have. (If I were, the terms you suggest would be 
excellent suggestions)

I am bringing to the attention of potential client writers that inline TIFF, if 
implemented well, could provide a ready means to browse this handy information, 
for which tags are already defined in the spec, bny constructing an on-the-fly 
document to hold the information.

If you want to suggest your tags as future enhancements to the TIFF spec, the 
address is tiff-input@aldus.com

On the other hand, if you are suggesting that images should have this 
information in the HTML document, then putting it as a link from the copyright 
symbol in the HTML 3 caption would seem like a good move.

Sounds good, this would mean inline multipart/parallel I suppose.

I am not all that happy with it either, but it sure as hell beats anonymous RGB 
which is the current situation. Do you have a pointer to a better spec which is 
implementable in the near future?

> Particularly car paint manufactures, who have a high gloss on the 
> final surface. 

That is becuase a single flat colour is different from a curved car panel 
painted that colour and then viewed in normal daylight. So, specifying a 
particular red in LAB does not tell you what a car will look like when painted 
that colour. Fine, but wide of the current context.

Whereas what we are discussing is sending around a photo, or (as in the paper I 
cited earlier) a daylight simulation of the car painted that colour, and 
ensuring that the *image* is viewed with much better fidelity than the present 
situation.

> I suppose what I'm really trying to say, is that colour
> representation is less important than 'appearance' representation.

I will agree with you for objects, and for printout (the Carisma project at 
Loughborogh University of Technology springs to mind here). I would like to see 
some evidence that this is a big enough win over LAB for on-screen viewing of 
images before bypassing LAB and going for something new that perhaps has little 
track record.

[About calibrated RGB spaces]
>This is going in the right direction, if the user is given the 
>ability to correctly set up a display system using these parameters.

1) Surely you realise that a calibrated RGB space is just an alternative 
representation of XYZ and that, if you are not happy with LAB (and by 
implication XYZ) then you are not happy with calibrated RGB either.

2) Users do not "correctly set up a display stystem using these parameters". 
How, pray, would you adjust your monitor chromaticities unless you have a 
phenomenally specialised monitor? Calibrated RGB can be displayed one of two 
ways:

- the quick and inaccurate way, call it RGNB and throw it at the screen
- convert from the known RGB space to XYZ and then display as with any other CIE 
based colour space.

> But then, people don't tweak dot gain to
>   compensate for miscalibrated imagesetters in this day and age, do they ;-P

I hope you spotted that was sarcasm.

> People do tweak monitor caliabration tho'

Tweak it for what purpose? What is your point here?

[About YCbCr colour space and subsampling]
> This is one of ( many ) my biggest problems with Photo-CD.

Kodak YCC, although based on YCbCr is not necessarily subject to the same 
limitations. In oparticular it is not limited by broadcast video conventions 
designed to stop transmitter overload and multiplexing artefacts. There is 
subsampling on the domestic version, but you can get a better image by taking 
the chrominance components from the next image resolution up. I don't know if  
the Pro version has subsampling.

> Agreed. There is also the problem that in digitised images of any type, 
> the backgound is not often uniform - black translates to about 48 shades

in RGB ;-) which is not perceptually iuniform. Those 48 shades all look much the 
same, don't they? There would be a lot less than 48 shades in, for example, LAB.

> when digitising from our videodisk via a TARGA board. The noise inherent in
> the system makes automatic background detection difficult

Are you using a CCIR-709 style gamma function with a toe-in slope limit near the 
origin, or a simple power law? If the latter, changing your gamma transfer 
function will help with noise a lot.

[About output quality consistency problems]
Commercial houses deal with this by calibrating to quality standards daily or 
hourly.

People with computer printers in the UK pounds 5 to 7k range should not be 
surprised if they do not get magazine quality with zero effort on their part. 
Especially if they throw raw RGB data at it.

Again, I am not sure whether you are saying the problem is insoluble and the 
attempt should be abandoned, or what.

[About Photoshop]
>No comment. ( Other than it is a commercial package ).

Sure. Also a defacto standard of astonishing uniformity across that whole 
industry. If there is already a MIME type for MS Word, I don't see a problem 
with another one for Photoshop files. It's just one more piece of technology to 
throw into the pot.

Why stop at 10? Values are available at 2 and 1 nm steps too - is this just a 
counsel of perfection or do you honestly think that this will give better image 
display on the monitor in a Web browser? I assume you are familiar with 
trichromatic theory and that wildly different spectra can give indistinguishable 
colours.

Sure. But when they do get it right, currently there is no way to make use of 
that. I would like to change this situation.

Better yet - is there an image file format that supports something like this
natively?  GIF95?  If so, then it simply becomes another image format that a
browser needs to/should support the inlining of, or shuffle off to an
external browser.

I don't think they've started doing BOF scheduling yet, but I had
planned to try to start a NASA WWW BOF.  I don't know if there are any
others, but if so, I'll probably see you there! 8-)

We were able to reproduce the problem with NCSA Mosaic. The

Subject: Re: Overlaying inline images
Mime-Version: 1.0 (Generated by Ean X.400 to MIME gateway)

Well, GIF89a supports the notion of overlaying images.  Most of the
time GIF is used as one image per file.  However, the format itself
is described as one or more images overlaid on a "screen".  99% of
the files consist of a screen size of W x H with a single image
of W x H that goes on the screen at position 0, 0.

So you could specify two or more images that overlay each other.
I believe GIF89a has many ways to handle this situation ranging
from just doing it, to timed delays (for simple animations) to
awaiting user input before continuing.

This would mostly solve the original problem.  You'd still have to
generate a GIF with the overlays, but that really is little more
than catting the images together.

I'm sure that such a solution will not be highly considered by
either the HTML 3.0 people or serious image people, but it may
be just useful enough to add in.  Go lobby your favorite browser
authors if you're keen on it.  For transparent GIFs I had to
write the (trivial) Mosaic patches and then piss off Eric Bina
mightly to get it included, but it's there now.

GIF89a support multiple images, and even display methods for those
images nativly.  The "transparent" information is a hack...

Transparancy in the GIF89a spec is defined as overlay information, 
specifically onto the background image.  True GIF files _always_ 
will have a background, not browser-defined...  Belive it or
not it is actually possible to create 24 bit deep images using
the GIF specification, but that something that no display tool
will be able to support.

The GIF89a spec would allows you to do simple animation if you 
wanted...

Subject: Interlaced vs. Non-interlaced GIFs
content-length: 765


I'm working on a software package that produces HTML documents and
GIFs (and other files) from a variety of input formats.  Currently,
all GIFs produced by the package are interlaced, so viewers that have
the capability (e.g. netscape) can get the incremental display that is
nice to have over slow connections. 

My question is this: is there any downside to always producing
interlaced images, or should I make it a user preference?  For
example, are there viewers that would choke on interlaced gifs?
(Mosaic doesn't).  Any other issues I should be aware of?

[Is this an appropriate question for this group?]

Thanks.

Speaking as one very biased individual, who claims to know something
about GIF images...

Interlaced images are good for two things:
	Slow links between client and server
	Cool fade in effect

I dislike them for these reasons:
	They have a better chance of compressing to a larger file size
	They are the _worst_ way you could think of to load images
		for an X windows display.  You have to scan convert
		line at a time and copy to the server, thus adding
		another client<->server interaction for every scanline.

The best thing to do is make it an option, since any time I produce
document for a Internal Information System, the server<->client
throughput is 10Mb/s or more and interlaced images are the last 
thing that I wan to ship around.  

Just my 0.02 cents..

ps.  On this product of yours, are we going to get the option
     of specifing what DPI resolution we would like the images
     generated for?  Since on of the things that I do a lot of 
     is when I rasterize line drawings is the following process:
       Frame -> postscript @ 150 dpi -> scale 50% -> GIF
     This results in an nice anti-aliased image.

   [ useful info deleted- thanks David ]

   ps.  On this product of yours, are we going to get the option
	of specifing what DPI resolution we would like the images
	generated for?  Since on of the things that I do a lot of 
	is when I rasterize line drawings is the following process:
	  Frame -> postscript @ 150 dpi -> scale 50% -> GIF
	This results in an nice anti-aliased image.

That's a good question, and I've been wondering what to do about this.
The product (Cyberleaf, it's been announced, so I can finally talk
about it.) uses "Styles" to determine how various components (text,
graphics and tables) should be converted into
HTML/GIF/Postscript. For graphics, these styles include a resolution
parameter (in dpi) for rasterization.  Currently, there is no nice GUI
for modifying these styles, but you can add new ones by dropping files
into a directory.  A graphic style looks something like this:

("Inline" 
 (:gif :inline nil nil 75)
 :output "<IMG $=SRC $=ALT $?ISMAP>")
 
Where the second line is (FORMAT INLINE|EXTERNAL TRANSPARENT THUMBNAIL RES)

What I've been wondering is how important it will be to include a nice
GUI for creating these style descriptions.  Basec on your comments, it
seems like I should definitely do it.  In any case it'll have to be in
the next release, because I'm getting real close to ship (code freeze
in 11 days, yikes)...

The specification is not very orthogonal, but if covers what people
need to do most of the time.  I suppose I'll add and Interlace option
to the style as well.

Thanks again for the help.

Captain's log, stardate 11-20-94. 

We have been in orbit of Bristola system for 2 weeks. Acting under orders
from W3 headquarters, an away team from engineering has been working on 
the planets surface attempting to renovate the native hypertext system.
Their report now follows. 

---
Here's some quick notes on how HTTP-NG is coming along - We've now got
a simple proof-of-concept implementation up and running, using a
minimalist set of requests and responses, and the results have been
quite encouraging. Even though the network connection between Bristol
and Civillization was extremely congested, initial timings seemed to
show that HTTP-NG was capable of using the entire path bandwidth
available when multiple requests were used. Initial measurements
seemed to show that for typical inlined-objects, HTTP 1.0 would only
use around a 10th of the available bandwidth, and that parallel
fetches degraded badly under congested conditions.



Architecture. 

HTTP-NG is designed to be a replacement for HTTP 1.0 offering much
higher performance and adding some extra features needed for use in
commercial applications. The protocol is designed to make it easy to
implement the basic functionality needed for a simple browser whilst
making the addition of more powerful features such as security and
authentication much simpler than it is for HTTP.

HTTP-NG uses a different basic model to HTTP. HTTP sets up a new
connection for every request, which causes a lot of severe performance
problems both in the time taken for each transaction, and the load
placed on both networks and servers.

To avoid these problems, HTTP-NG allows many different requests to be
sent over a single connection. These requests are asynchronous -
there's no need for the client to wait for a response before sending
out a different request. The server can also respond to requests in
any order it sees fit - it can even interweave the data from multiple
objects, allowing several images to be transferred in "parallel".

To make these multiple data streams easy to work with, HTTP-NG sends
all it's messages and data using a "session layer". This divides the
connection up into lots of different channels. HTTP-NG sends all
control messages (GET requests, meta-information etc) over a control
channel. Each object is returned over in its own channel.

This separation of data and control information also makes redirection
much more powerful - for example, if the object is a video the server
can return the meta-information over the same connection, together
with a URL pointing to a dedicated video transfer protocol that will
fetch the data for the relevant object.  This becomes much more
important when working with multimedia aware networking technologies,
such as ATM or RSVP.

----
Implementation experience.

There are several obvious ways of implementing HTTP-NG. The first
approach is to use a simple synchronous RPC model. The client
establishes a connection to the server, then sends out a request. The
client then waits until it has received all the data corresponding to
the request, then returns. This approach is very simple to implement,
and corresponds quite closely to current practice in older HTTP
clients. As a simple optimization, the implementation could send a
number of requests before waiting for all their responses.

The second approach is to use an event based model. A simple
dispatcher can be wrapped around the connection. Each request then
adds a callback that should be called whenever the response to the
request comes in. This model works well with event based browsers such
as Arena and Netscape; it is also quite simple to implement.

The final approach is to use a multi-threaded implementation; each
request and channel gets allocated its own thread, allowing multiple
requests to be processed in parallel.  This model works supremely well
for servers, especially those serving as proxies.  The proxy server
can keep a cache of open connections to other proxies or to popular
sites. Since each connection resides within a single process, requests
that can't be satisfied from the local cache can easily be switched to
the appropriate connection. This approach also allows efficient
gatewaying of HTTP 1.0 requests (see next section).


Transition
----------

The best transition strategy for moving from HTTP 1.0 to HTTP-NG is
through the use of intermediate proxy servers. This allows the
existing base of servers and clients to continues operating as they
are now, whilst still taking advantage of much of the performance
enhancements in the new protocol.

The reason that this works is that most of the performance problems in
HTTP 1.0 are caused by delays in the network. If proxy servers are
placed close to older clients and servers, then these delays become
significant. For example, if two servers are placed at either end of a
transatlantic link, communicating with each other using HTTP-NG, but
accepting and sending requests to and from other systems using HTTP
1.0, all the HTTP 1.0 delays would all occur within a continent,
rather than spanning the intercontinental links. Further, a cacheing
server can interpret HTML documents and pre-fetch any inlined objects
before an HTTP client requests them.

FHTTP - Architectural Overview

Simon Spero, UNC Sunsite/EIT
(ses@unc.edu)

About FHTTP

	FHTTP is an enhanced replacement for HTTP/1.0. It is
designed to correct the known performance problems in previous
versions of HTTP, and to provide extra support for commercial
transactions, including enhanced security and support for on-line
payment.

About this document

This document provides an architectural overview of the new
protocol. It gives an overall view of how the protocol works, 	and
explains how various operations and features interact 	with each
other and the network. This document is intended for a 	general
audience, and is not a technical specification. This is not an
official W3O document.

Why do we need a new protocol? 

HTTP is the fastest growing protocol on the internet. It is simple to
implement, and thousands of people use it every day to browse through
gigabytes of on-line hypertext. If HTTP is working so well, why
replace it? The driving forces behind this change are the twin needs
of performance and commerce.

The Need For Performance

Part of the need for a new protocol is caused by the very fact of
HTTP's success. The original protocol was designed to be a simple way
of transferring a file between two machines. This led to several very
serious performance problems, adding extra delays to the time taken to
fetch pages, and preventing browsers from making efficient use of the
network.

Commercial Applications

Although many publishers and companies are now starting to explore the
possibilities opened up by the World Wide Web, the protocols currently
in use do not support several very important features needed for
electronic commerce. Currently there is no reliable way to find out
the identity of someone trying to access a document. There is also no
way to convey information about charging and prices; nor is there a
way of dealing with on-line payment.

Can these changes be made by just tweaking HTTP 1.0?

The major problem in making just minor changes HTTP 1.0 is that the
modifications which are needed change the fundamental model on which
the protocol is based. Each extension adds more and more com- plexity
to the protocol; as more and more enhancements are made, the problem
becomes much worse.  Since HTTP 1.0 is a simple protocol, it is much
simpler to recreate the existing functionality as part of a new
protocol than to attempt to kludge the new functionality into a
protocol not designed to handle such changes.

	User Requirements

Any new protocol needs to meet the needs to three different groups.
Individual users want to be able to browse the web without being
forced to wait for pages to be delivered. Information providers need
to be able to support large numbers of users, and to restrict access
to authorized users, and to get money from their paying customers.
Software developers need a system which is easy to implement, but
which can be optimized and enhanced to differentiate between products.



TABLE 1. User requirements

Simplicity	

FHTTP must allow simple implementations to be implemented simply 
without penalising more optimized systems. The protocol should be 
designed to work well for the commonest cases

Performance:

		FHTTP should allow objects to be transferred over wide
area networks efficiently.

Asynchronicity:

FHTTP should allow a client or server to initiate a new 	
request with- out waiting for previous requests to complete. It should
be possible to transfer multiple objects in parallel over a single
connection.

	Security:

		FHTTP should support the transfer of encrypted 	
objects. The protocol should not impose a single security policy or
mechanism.

Authentication:

FHTTP should support mutual authentication between all 	 parties
involved in a transaction. It should be possible to 	 relay
authentication information through multiple untrusted 	
intermediaries. It should also be possible to use multiple
authentication contexts over a single con- nection.

	Charging:

FHTTP should provide support for on-line payment schemes 	 such
as First Virtual and DigiCash. The protocol should not 	 impose a
single payment policy or mechanism.

Intermediate Servers: 	

FHTTP should provide support for server to server 	interaction to
allow for the maintenance of caches and mirrors, 	and to allow
intermediate servers to relay usage information to 	originating
sites.

Mandatory display: 	

FHTTP should support the mandatory display of information 	
relating to an object, such as licensing information, copyright,
authorship.

Logging Information

FHTTP should support the transfer of logging information between
intermediate servers and the original source of a resource. Users
should be able to specify restrictions on the use of logging
information, and to discontinue transactions if such restrictions
cannot be satisfied.

Network requirements - Transports of Delight

FHTTP is transport-layer independent, and can arrange for data
transfer using different transports.  However, since all uses of FHTTP
in the current internet will be over TCP, FHTTP must work well over
TCP.

TCP and the Internet

Many performance problems in HTTP are a result of not taking Transport
layer interactions into account. Table\x112 lists some important
points that need to be taken into account when designing a proto- col.



TABLE 2. Important features of TCP

Connection setup costs

When TCP sets up a connection, it sends connection request to the
server, and waits for the connection to be accepted or rejected. This
adds a delay of one Round Trip Time.

Slow start limits transfer rates during start up.

When a connection is first started, TCP initially sends only a small
amount of data. The amount of data that can be transmit- ted before
the sender must wait for a reply is increased until a steady state is
reached- if congestion occurs and packets are lost, the server slows
down the send rate until a new stable point is reached.

Slow-start particularly affects the first request on a new connec-
tion. If the request won't fit into a single segment, the client must
wait an extra Round Trip before it can finish sending the request.

Congestion information is not shared between connections

Although slow-start is used to converge upon the correct trans-
mission rate for the path between two computers, this informa- tion is
not shared between different connections to the same host. Thus is
there are several connections running between a pair of hosts, if the
path becomes congested, the connections will interfere with each
other, leading to poor throughput.

Special purpose transport layers.

As resource reservation and guaranteed bandwidth become more
commonplace, and as ATM moves into more general deployment, it becomes
important to be able to make use of special purpose transport layers
which are optimised for certain types of media- for example, a
multicast video transmission, or a ATM telephone channel. FHTTP should
be able to refer a user on to another service for actual data trans-
fer, whilst still being able to handle the relevant control
information.



		Protocol Model 

	HTTP 1.0 works by creating a new transport connection for each
request. The client sends a request over the connection; the 	server
replies over the same connection, sending information 	about the
response, followed if possible by the requested data.

	    




	FHTTP uses a different model. Instead of creating a separate
connection for each request, FHTTP cre- ates a single connection
which can be used for many different requests. The connection is
divided up into a number of virtual sessions. One of these
sessions is used to carry control information - requests from the
client, and meta-data from the server. The other channels are 	used
to carry the requested objects.


Requests and Responses

Each request and response is sent as an FHTTP message. Some parts of a
message are the same in all cases. For example, each message may need
to be signed by the sender to make sure that the request is genuine.
Other parts of the message are different for each operation. A GET
request will specify a list of the objects to fetch- the response will
contain information describing the retrieved objects.

All of this information must be encoded in some way before it can be
sent over the network. HTTP 1.0 uses a text based syntax to encode
requests, and a modified form of MIME to handle responses. This tex-
tural representation is easy for humans to understand, but quickly
becomes extremely complicated when used to handle requests with
complicated structure.

To avoid this complexity, FHTTP uses a different way of describing and
encoding the request message.  The scheme used is a simplified form of
ASN.1 and PER (Abstract Syntax Notation, and Packed Encod- ing Rules).
This scheme allows efficient, compact parsers to be generated
automatically, whilst remain- ing simple enough to allow hand-crafted
parsers to be built easily.

FHTTP messages can be sent at any time. In the typical case, the
client sends a request message to the server, and gets back one or
more responses in return. The client doesn't have to wait for a
response to one request before sending out another. Since returned
objects can be interleaved on a stream, this allows clients such as
Mosaic Communications NetScapeTM to request objects as soon as they
discover they are needed, and allows intermediate servers to handle
requests from different clients to the same server in a fair and
efficient manner.

Although the usual pattern is for the client to issue requests to the
server, there are some cases where this pattern needs to be reversed.
One example for this is the need to warn browsers if a requested
action would result in a hefty charge. In this case, the server needs
to be able to check to see if the client still wishes to perform that
action, and to discuss with the client how sir wishes to pay.

Negotiations - The Art of The Deal

Because FHTTP doesn't restrict the types of objects which can be
requested, and does not impose a single security or payment policy,
there needs to be some way of negotiating which types and mecha- nisms
a client and server can support.

HTTP 1.0 allowed clients to propose a list of types which they were
able to accept; unfortunately the mechanism used had several problems.
Because the client had to sent a list of all possible types with each
request, requests typically contained over 1K of type information.
This caused serious performance problem, and required a lot of effort
to process correctly. As a result of this complexity, very few servers
properly supported this type negotiation.

FHTTP tries to simplify negotiation by adding an extra mechanism to
support the most common cases without affecting more complicated
situations. This new form of negotiation is based on the observation
that the vast majority of all WWW traffic involves the exchange of
just a few well-known object types.  FHTTP defines a small list of
these well-known types, and allows sets of these types to be encoded
in a short bitmap. A text only browser would sent a bitmap indicating
support for just HTML and plain text.  A graphical brower would claim
support for several graphics and sound formats. A server or browser
which only supports these types need only support this simple form of
negotiation.

To indicate support for other types. FHTTP also allows the client and
server to add extra items to the bit-sets. The proposer send a message
containing the option being proposed (for example, text/ms- word),
together with a numeric code which will be used in later messages to
refer to the proposed value.

This kind of indirect reference is useful, because it allows the
proposed types and values to become more structured without affecting
performance. This extra freedom can be used to support parameterized
types; for example, if a client is running on a 4-bit display, a
server can avoid generating a 24-bit deep image.

The same method is used to indicate supported security schemes,
authentication information, and pay- ment mechanisms.

Security

Because there are so many different security schemes and policies,
FHTTP provides a general security framework into which the various
security components can be fitted. This results in several
architectural decisions. One such is the absence of any special
support for certificate exchange; this exchange is han- dled using the
Fetch request (which is after all the most fundamental operation in
FHTTP).

The FHTTP message wrapper has fields which can carry arbitrary
authentication and security informa- tion. This allows each message to
be individually authenticated.

FHTTP also allows an intermediate server to relay authorisation and
verification to and from another server on behalf of one of its
clients. This feature allows untrusted proxies to cache encrypted
data, and to relay the information needed to decrypt this data to the
end user without having to be able to decode the document itself.

Charging and Payment 

FHTTP allows a server to initiate a payment request in response to an
action of the client. This allows the server to request specific
authorisation from the client for actions for which charges will be
incurred- the challenge includes cost information, and a list of
acceptable payment mechanisms; the response may include payment using
a mutually acceptable method of on-line payment.

The Client may also use the negotiation mechanisms to authorise a
series of payments without requir- ing explicit approval for each
item. The server can also provide pricing information as part of an
objects meta-data.

Mandatory Display

The client may negotiate a set of fields such as licensing information
and authorisation which it is pre- pared to automatically display to
the user along with the actual requested information. This allows
infor- mation providers whose database licences require such
information to be displayed at the start of each session to be made
available over the web.

Copyright Control

Each transferred object may have associated copying information
associated with it. This information can be used to assist honest
implementations from accidentally violating the terms of a licence
agree- ment.

Transition from HTTP 1.0

FHTTP uses two strategies for transition from HTTP 1.0 to the new
protocol. One strategy uses a dual stack approach - the other is based
on the use of proxy servers.

To support the dual stack approach, FHTTP has been designed to
co-exist with FHTTP on the same port. Each FHTTP connect begins with a
syntactically legal HTTP 1.0 request, using a non-existent method. If
an FHTTP client tries to talk to an old HTTP server, the HTTP server
will send back a `Method not supported' message; the client can then
cache this information, and repeat the request using the old protocol.
If an old server tries to access a new server, the server can either
handle the transaction using HTTP 1.0, or return an error message.

The dual stack approach doesn't offer much improvement for clients
that don't support FHTTP directly. Proxy servers allow old clients to
take advantage of some of the newer performance features.  The proxy
server can pre-fetch inlined images using the new protocol, so that
they are ready and waiting when the client requests them; since the
proxy server will usually be on the same network as the client, this
reduces latency delays to a minimum.

A proxy server can also multiplex several HTTP 1.0 requests over the
same connection. This allows browsers like NetScape to request
multiple concurrent images without causing congestion problems.



Historical Notes

This document was produced with assistance of David St. John Raggett
(Hewlett Packard), Phillip Hallam-Baker (CERN), Allan Schiffman (EIT),

FHTTP has been inspired and influenced by several earlier protocols. The roll of honor includes:

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

WAIS (Wide Area Information Servers)

NISO Z39.50 (Search and Retrieve)

IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol)

TCP (Transport Control Protocol)

T/TCP (Transaction TCP)

Session Control Protocol (SCP)
------------------------------

Several heavily used Internet applications such as  FTP, GOPHER, and
HTTP use a protocol model in which every transaction requires a separate
TCP connection. Since clients normally issue multiple requests to the 
same server, this model is quite inefficient, as it incurs all the connection
start up costs for every single request.

SCP is a simple protocol which lets a server and client have multiple 
conversations over a single TCP connection. The protocol is designed to be
simple to implement, and is modelled after TCP.

Services.
---------

SCP's main service is dialogue control. This service allows either end of the
connection to establish a virtual session over a single transport connection.
SCP also allows a sender to indicate message boundaries, and allows a reciever
to reject an incoming session.

Design goals.
-------------

	o Unconfirmed service without negotiation. 

	  SCP allows data to be sent with the session establishment; the 
	  recepient does not confirm successful connection establishment, but 
	  may reject unsuccessful attempts. This simplifies the design of the
	  protocol, and removes the latency required for a confirmed operation.

	o Low overhead

 	  SCP has a fixed overhead of 8 bytes per segment. This overhead is 
	 half the size of an IPNG address, and is only incurred once per 
	 segment, instead of once per packet.

	o Simple design

	  The session protocol should be simple enough to implement for a 
	 single application.

Protocol Operation:
-------------------

Session ID allocation.

Each session is allocated a session identifier. Session Identifiers below
1024 are reserved. Session IDs allocated by clients are  even; those allocated
by servers, odd. 

Session establishment.

A session is established by setting the SYN bit in the first message sent on
that channel. 

Graceful release.

A session is ended by sending a message with the FIN bit set. Each end of a 
connection may be closed independently.

Disgraceful release.

A session may be terminated by sending a message with the RST bit set. All
pending data for that session should be discarded

Message boundaries.

A message boundary is marked by sending a message with the PUSH bit set. The
boundary is set at the final octet in this message, including that octet.

I suppose once you have a good standard, calibration images can be made

In general I agree. However to hand balance 20,000 images is a looong

This is certainly not what I'm trying to say. I would hope that people will
not rush into saying TIFF is *the* solution for all time. I believe that
as wide a view of the potential problems should be aired as possible before
we shoot ourselves in the foot. I am quite prepared to accept existing
standards as time proven, but I do think that some thought for the 
future needs to be discussed.

Fine by me, so long as they are expandable and people accept that things

I don't see it as requiring one fixed method - more are possible so long

Technically you may be correct - I hear a lot of people asking for their
'perfect' images to be sent out with a method which they can control.
This is similar to the problem I had recently with an un-named author 
who phoned me complaining that the text files I had put on our web server
were badly corrupted - I explained that if he read the intro pointing out
that Mosaic 2.0a2 didn't work with the system they would have looked fine.
The point I'm trying to make here is that you can put too much reliance on
the client authors in such cases unless you specify a minimum common
denominator.

I'm not certain yet that TIFF is the format to use in the long term. Before
I hassle them I'd like to see more discussion here as to the real 
requirements in terms of system independence and network issues.
It's better to give them one proposal that many IMHO. But thanks for 
the mailing list address anyway.

This is fine, except that the information then gets lost if the image file
is downloaded separately. This is a situation many of our image donors

I've seen a lot of users try. This was my argument at Spectrum Ic. about
on screen 'true' colour representation. However, modern monitors are
allowing much more control over this kind of setup. If this trend 
continues, I would like to be ready to take advantage of it.
Even a basic monitor with just brightness and contrast controls can
drastically alter the quality of a displayed image.

I hope the same as yours - given an option to tweak something, people will.
The best you can hope for is to be able to give them some guidelines on 
*how* to tweak it without screwing everything up.

How does the comment 'B****** if I know ?' go down at this point ? This is
one area where the equipment which we can afford does not give us the
degree of control over the process which we wish for ;-(
In the case of most image suppliers out in netland, this is also going to
be true. We are also using sources which have been though several stages
of video manipulation.

This is not something which bothers me in particular. Most people with
that kind of equipment will be specialists. I thought we were discussing

Definately not. Just that it is not something which can be solved just be

Yes, but at the same time you can calculate most 3D colour spaces from 
spectro data, ( 10nm is an illustration - not many peopel nowdays have 
spectros which will do more than that ). In addition, for most scanners
this would have to be back-calculated anyway as they sample in RGB.(?) 
Given spectro data you have a non-subjective method for comparing the 
values - two values which differ may indicate a different colour, but
all values the same WILL indicate the same colour.

Please - this was not meant to be an attack on what you are trying to 
do, but I believe that a lot of people out there are not specialists
in the imaging field ( I'm certainly not ). I think that these issues
have to be looked at from the technical side, and also from the 
usability side. No matter how good a file format is, it won't solve
all the problems ; That's not a reason NOT to design one, just a reason
to raise the awareness of why the problems occur in the first place.

I don't see any format making a major difference to the quality of
image transmission in the next year or so - this is not something which
has to be rushed into.

        ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS - AusWeb95 - AUSTRALIA, April 1995
        ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS - AusWeb95 - AUSTRALIA, April 1995

Ballina Beach Resort, Ballina, Far North Coast of New South Wales, Australia.
                           29 April to 2 May 1995

A QUICK OVERVIEW

Southern Cross University hosts AusWeb95 at the Ballina Beach Resort in
Ballina on the Far North Coast of New South Wales, Australia from 29 April
to 2 May 1995. AusWeb95 is the first Australian conference on the
WorldWideWeb.

The conference has been designed to bring together those that are interested
in the content, technical and societal aspects of the Web. Because the Web
is so new and evolving so rapidly, we are all "beginners" and can (and must)
learn from each other.

The conference will cover the major issues in WorldWideWeb development
in ten "tracks" and a poster and "Birds of a Feather" session. It will feature
both Australian and international speakers. The proceedings of AusWeb95
will be published in both electronic and print formats. There will also be a
competition for "the most interesting Web site in the World".

Full details on AusWeb95 can be seen at
          http://www.scu.edu.au/ausweb95/index.html
or by emailing the organisers at mailto:AusWeb95@scu.edu.au

WHERE IS IT BEING HELD?

Ballina is a seaside, tourist town on the Far North Coast of New South
Wales, Australia with excellent connections by air to Sydney and by road
from Coolangatta.It is only 20 minutes drive from Byron Bay which is one of
the most sought after tourist areas in Australia and an hour to the World
Heritage listed rain forest of the Nightcaps National Park. The Ballina Beach
resort is 50 metres from Ballina's excellent surfing Lighthouse Beach. In April
you can still comfortably swim in the sea but there is also the Resort's pool,
spa and sauna, not to mention the tennis courts. The AusWeb95 home page has
pictures of the resort, the beach and of Byron Bay.

The Lismore campus of Southern Cross University is 28km inland from Ballina.

PRECONFERENCE TRAINING WORKSHOP

A "hands on" Preconference Training Workshop will be held at the University on
Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 April. The workshop is designed for those who
have heard about the Web and wish to learn about this important resource.
No WWW, or for that matter Internet, experience is assumed. Participants
will learn how to author WorldWideWeb materials and how to bring a server
to the net. The workshop will be very much hands on and will use training
materials which have been developed for staff at Southern Cross University.
The workshop will conclude with each participant developing material which
will incorporate text, graphics, video and sound.

There will be a limit of 20 people in the training workshop with each
participant having their own computer.

For further details, email the conference organisers at
mailto:AusWeb95@scu.edu.au
or call Allan Ellis (+61 66 20 3611) or Roger Debreceny (+61 66 20 3837).

WHAT IS THE CONFERENCE FORMAT?

AusWeb95 has been designed to maximise the interaction between the
participants and to facilitate the sharing of experiences and to foster co-
operative project and content development. There are a total of ten
simultaneous sessions on the programs which will be designated as tracks.
As all papers will be available well ahead of the conference there is no need
for lengthy formal presentations. For each track there will be a moderator
who will be asked to draw the threads from each of the presentations on that
track. Paper contributors will then be able to make some opening comments
before the issues are thrown open to general discussion amongst the
participants.

WHAT IS THE CONFERENCE PROGRAM?

The program, which will be amended as necessary following
feedback from participants, is as follows:

Friday 28 April

Preconference Workshop participants arrive.

Saturday 29 April

9:00am-5:00pm All day Preconference Training Workshop
7:00pm Preconference workshop dinner at Ballina Beach Resort.

Sunday 30 April

9:00am-5:00pm All day Preconference Training Workshop
8:00pm Conference Dinner and Official Opening. The conference dinner
is being held at the start of the conference so that everyone has a
chance to meet the other conference participants before the conference
commences.

Monday 1 May

9:00-9:15 The opening of the conference will be short and sweet.
9:15-10:00 am "The best Web site competition". The Web is
changing so very quickly that no one person can keep up with all
Web developments. This competition will allow conference
participants to vie for an excellent prize by making three
minute presentations on "the best Web site". Voting will be by all
the participants.
10:00-10:15am Morning Tea
10:15am-12:00pm Simultaneous sessions (2)
12:00-1:00pm Lunch
1:00pm-2:30pm Simultaneous sessions (2)
2:30pm-2:45pm Afternoon Tea
3:00-4:30pm Simultaneous sessions (2)
Enjoy the pool, spa, sauna or beach, then:
6:30 BBQ Dinner
7:30-8:30 Overseas speaker

Tuesday 2 May

9:00 -10:15am  Simultaneous sessions (2)
10:15-10:30am Morning Tea
10:30am-12:00pm Simultaneous sessions (2)
12:30-1:30pm Lunch
1:30-3:00pm Poster and Birds of a Feather sessions
3:00-3:15pm Afternoon Tea
3:15-4pm Report Backs from the Simultaneous sessions
4:00-5:00pm Plenary session and overseas speaker


WHAT ARE THE THEMES OF THE CONFERENCE?

The themes from the conference will be drawn from the expressed interests of
the participants. Listed below and on the registration form are a total of 21
tracks - clearly 21 tracks into 10 simultaneous sessions do not go! And it is
very likely that there will need to be more than one track on education. So
some of these tracks may well be put together, and others will be covered in
the poster and Birds of a Feather session. The final tracks will be decided
after 3 February 1995.

which seems to preclude this anti-aliasing. Could I suggest

(FORMAT INLINE|EXTERNAL TRANSPARENT THUMBNAIL RES SAMPLES-PER-PIXEL)

where SAMPLES-PER-PIXEL is 1, 4, or 9 (maybe that sould be 1,2,3 on the 
understanding it is always squared) to allow for antialiasing or not as a user 
pref. Bear in mind though that antialiasing and transparent gifs interact - the 
rough background colour has to be antialiased to.

BTW the syntax quoted does not seem to allow you to specify what colour is 
transparent, do you assume white? or is the parameter an RGB value if it is not 
NIL. (So, in the GUI, users click on the image to say what colour they want 
transparent).

Put politely, BS. A single light spectrum can be reduced to an XYZ in precisely 
two ways, for either a  2 degree or a 10 degree observer. The latter is rarely 
used, which leaves one way.

XYZ is a reproducible and measureable colour description which has been an 
international standard for the last 63 years.

Ah. OK, that is not what *I* was trying to say. I just threw up a rag bag of 
technology that might bear upon the problem and, as it happens, TIFF does do 
quite a lot of good things. Clarification, the TIFF spec does ;-)

But I did not mean to present TIFF as a universal panacea.

Qoute from the Tagged Image File Format spec again, just as an example you 
understand  ;-)

"A tag based scheme cannot guarantee painless growth. But it does provide a 
useful tool to assist in the process"...

" TIFF will be enhanced on a continuing basis as new imaging needs arise. A high 
priority has been given to structuring the data in such a way as to minimise the 
pain of future additions"

   > ("Inline"

   which seems to preclude this anti-aliasing. Could I suggest

   (FORMAT INLINE|EXTERNAL TRANSPARENT THUMBNAIL RES SAMPLES-PER-PIXEL)

   where SAMPLES-PER-PIXEL is 1, 4, or 9 (maybe that sould be 1,2,3 on
   the understanding it is always squared) to allow for antialiasing or
   not as a user pref. Bear in mind though that antialiasing and
   transparent gifs interact - the rough background colour has to be
   antialiased to.

I must confess some ignorance to implementation issues with respect to
anti-aliasing.  But it would be easy to add more parameters to the
graphics processing syntax.  The rastering engine I am using already
does some anti-aliasing automatically.  I'll look into more general
anti-aliasing in a future release, since a lot of people seem to think
it's a good idea. 

   BTW the syntax quoted does not seem to allow you to specify what
   colour is transparent, do you assume white? or is the parameter an RGB
   value if it is not NIL. (So, in the GUI, users click on the image to
   say what colour they want transparent).

Currently, white is the correct background color 99% of the time,
since the GIFs that Cyberleaf generates are usually from vector
drawings, which are imposed on white "paper."  Once again, it would be
easy to extend the processing parameters to specify a color (RGB or
whatever) as the background. 

Thanks for the suggestions. I wish I'd tuned into this alias six
months ago.

Does anyone know of a way to set up a NO PROXY option for specific addresses
in Mosaic (X-windows, MS Windows, and MAC) like you can do in the Netscape 
preferences?

Thanks,

Subject: Registry of Browsers and Servers?
content-length: 991

A while back, there was some discussion about a server doing different things
based on the type of browser in use.  There was some discussion about 
adding various headers to describe the browser, about having a table of 
table of browser types and various other options.  In addition, there was some
recent discussion about authentication and other browser and server features.

What I was wondering, is there anyone keeping a table of what browsers and 
servers support what features.  For instance, it was recently stated that
Mosaic had a problem with authentication and thus one service favored NetScape
as the browser of choice of that service.  

Does anyone have a list of features and which browsers and servers either 
fully or partially implement them?

The recent mail about WWW and the search for a graphical file format
illustrates a certain lack of awareness of the status and capabilities 
of CGM.  So far, all of the requirements which have been articulated
are directly met either by CGM:1992 itself, or one of the industry
profiles.  Probably, SVF could be defined as a Profile of CGM.

I will address one specific point of misinformation, from the mail dialog...

This is wrong.  CGM:1992 Amendment 2 has finished processing, final text
has been reviewed and will soon (already?) go to Geneva.  Amd.2 is a simple
addition to the standard to define Application Structures.  The purpose of
these (or one purpose) is exactly to enable structuring and hot links.
Products are already being built and sold which use these standard CGM
features!

It is hard to believe that the world needs yet another graphical file
format.  Sitting next to me is the 900-page Encyclopedia of Graphical
File Formats, which describes approximately 90 graphics formats.

Phillip, you say you've produced code for Unicode support, so the
above comment mystifies me.  First of all, what is a "Unicode-based
programming language"?  As far as I can tell, bad old C can process
Unicode bits as well as it can ASCII or EBCDIC bits.  Are you alluding
to the problem of embedded nulls in strings in the C libraries?

Second, what do fancy fonts have to do with Unicode?  Unicode doesn't
specify fonts at all, only characters.

Finally, you appear to imply that using Unicode character encodings is
somehow not orthogonal from HTML formatting.  In what way?

Perhaps someone could go into this in a little more detail?  I have
photoshop (Mac) at my disposal, as well as a UNIX box (that I am more
unfamilier with)

What do you mean by "Frame"?  Do you mean save it (the random image) as a
postscript file at 150dpi, then scale that image by 50% and save as a gif?

What are the advantages to this?

Thanks

Mea Culpa.  I had a chart which I submitted for corrections that 
summarized the user authentication and forms abilities of the browsers I 
saw hitting our site in preparation for the forms-and-user-auth side of 
HotWired.  You can see the results of that query at 

http://www.hotwired.com/browsers.html

However, it was NOT intended to be used on, or suggest its use on, server
that return different responses to different browsers.  The only place 
that's done on HotWired is to warn users of NCSA Mosaic for Windows that 
they can't post in authenticated areas.

The bug has been fixed for the next release of WinMosaic I've been told - 
stay tuned to the above URL for info :)

The key dream feature which is the link to many other dreamt-of features 
is turning a web server into a real production and publication system:

* a real revision control system, with backwards mistake-fixing 
* documents may have many states, some of which may require that they not 
  be "public", but readable (and writeable) by a particular group of users
* publication paths can be set to require certain signatures of approval
  before being publishable (i.e. the editors and layout people sign off 
  on it)
* items on the web server are assigned abstract document identifiers, so
  inlined images can be referenced by name rather than by relative 
  location, so URL's don't change even if the document's location does.
* Upon initial submission of an object into the database, the creator is 
  prompted for things like a title, an author, etc.  This information is
  needed for non-HTML documents, too.

There are many spinoff benefits.  When documents are "published", the 
full-text search engines can be incrementally indexed, for example.

Of course other uses for databases would be things like the threaded
discussion space I wrote for HotWired (or a more generalized annotation 
system), support for the subscription-based model we use, log file 
analysis, or even just a generic API for programmers.

Looked great!

The act of fetching inlined images could be made faster if the server 
were able to tell the client directly in its response headers "I think 
you'll want to get these items next" - that way the client doesn't have 
to parse the document as it's coming down the pipe looking for inlined 
images.  I.e., in HTTP/1.0 terms (since I haven't seen the HTTP-NG terms)

C: GET / HTTP/1.0

S: ...
   Inlined-objects-URI: /Images/yes.gif, /Images/no.gif
   ...

The server just has to spend the effort to derive this info once and can 
cache it in memory or to disk from then on, doing quick if-modified 
checks to see if that info may have changed.  The client then still has 
the option of getting the inlined object from a cache somewhere.

Seems to me that this might be a good idea. It would need an HTML extention but I doubt
that this would be consistent with SGML. Perhaps it could go into the <header> area ?
Would anyone more knowledgeable care to comment ?

Kindest regards Sean.

Dear Webmaster,

We seek Web sites interested in joining our Virtual Places software
beta test program.  

In a nutshell, Virtual Places is a client-server architecture that
allows Web users to meet and communicate at Web pages in real time.
It consists of the Doors Server and the Sesame Navigator.  The Doors
Server runs in parallel with the Web server (no modifications
required), transforming Web pages into shared spaces where people can
meet and communicate.  The Sesame Navigator, an extension of NCSA 
Mosaic, allows users to communicate using real-time audio and/or text
chat, and navigate around shared spaces in guided tour groups. 
Both are available now for Sparcstations running SunOS 4.1.3 and will
soon be available for Solaris 2.3 and HP-UX 9.X.  Sesame for Windows
will be available at a later date.

If you are interested in joining our beta test program please use
the application form, available at our home page at
http://www.ubique.com, where you will also find information about
Ubique, Virtual Places and the beta test program.     

If you have questions not answered by our on-line information, feel
free to contact me directly.

I belive that the HTML Level 3 working group are already considering 
something like this - Simon may well be able to comment ? 

We definately think that this is a good idea, but would like to see it
generalised to requesting regions and gravity much as the X-windows packer
does. This has applications in Computer based learning, where this kind
of layout control is much more important that with basic document
presentation.

Subject: Overlaying inline images
content-length: 3030

OK, I'll concede that I don't know for sure that combining images on the fly
is too CPU intensive.  I haven't tried it.  We have some administrative
barriers that make it difficult to develop WWW scripts, especially if they're
not written in Perl.  That's our problem and doesn't justify a new feature of
HTML, but it does make me less inclined to try something I expect will turn
out to be unworkable.  Anyway, I think I'm justified in wanting a priori to
keep the requirements for the server as lightweight as possible: WWW use in
general is heavy and growing explosively, and Mars seems to be very popular,
judging from the hundreds of thousands of accesses by more than 10,000
distinct hosts over the last four months.

Let me try to make my case better by proposing two applications that would be
difficult to do without overlay support in HTML, for reasons other than CPU
load on the server.

1.  The images might not be on the same server.  Someone might want to import
an image produced by specialized code on another server, and then annotate it.
For example, it would be nice to import a map from the map viewer at PARC and
add specialized overlays (e.g., shuttle image locations, an airline's routes,
a telephone network's trunk lines, the route to your building).  Without an
overlay feature, this requires either getting a duplicate of the large
database the map viewer uses and duplicating much of the software, or having
an HTTP client and GIF file parser built into the server.  (If the first
option doesn't seem so unworkable, suppose that the background is the current
weather map or traffic congestion map instead.  Maybe you want to show the
\quick/ route to your building or explain why half your flights are late.)
The client-within-server option is possible, but it seems an unnecessary
implementation burden for each server, and it doubles the network traffic.

2.  If HTML supported overlaying small (opaque) images over large images at a
specified position, it would make some nice interfaces possible that would
otherwise require retransmitting unnecessarily large amounts of data over the
network.  The big image can put the small one in context.  E.g. it might be an
unchanging picture of a clickable panel of control buttons, with a "screen" in
the middle that contains a changing picture.  Or it might be a global map with
a magnifying glass under which a detail is displayed at 10x scale.

The big image may take 30 seconds to download, but after that the user can
move to dozens of different views with a fast response time, because only
the small image is being downloaded.

The syntax might look something like this, as a strawman (or is that
"cohesively-challenged-person"?) proposal:

<Overlay IsMap>
<Image width=1000 height=1000 src="Big-Map.gif">
<Image width=120  height=120  src="Magnifying-glass-Stencil.gif"
        x-offset=290 y-offset=590
        TRANSPARENT>
<Image width=100  height=100  src="Closeup-of-20S-45W.gif"
        x-offset=300 y-offset=600
        OPAQUE>
</Overlay>

I always figured LINK was intended for this sort of use - the fact that 
the BACK button always takes you to the previously seen instead of the
logically previous document is something I have taken to be historical
accident.  A decent browser should be able to parse the LINK data to 
help you navigate.  Press NEXT to go to the next page - wouldn't that be
great?

As for showing icons etc.  we have added SRC="url" to the list of LINK tags
in the much hacked X-Mosaic, so that <LINK HREF="url.html" SRC="url.gif">
renders the url.gif in a title area that sits separately from the main
window.  Clicking it traverses the HREF to "url.html".
The next  (il)logical kluge would be LINK ALT...  

Anyway - this is definitely a useful area -  my hope is that future browsers
will support arbitrary link buttons, so that a document with several links
would sport a little button bar of its own:
 [Mail Author] [Previous Pg] [Next Pg] [Start] [End] [Previous Ch] [Next Ch]
  REV="made"    REL="PREVIOUS" REL="NEXT" REL="START" etc etc...

Most of the above is prototyped on www.europe.ibm.com. and I would say that all 
Brian describes is all certainly doable. It is possible to treat all WWW
data including gateway/executable programs and imagemaps as objects in a
relational database. Each object posses attributes for display/execution,
management and index/search.

The biggest problem seems to be resistance by users to "funny looking" URL's,
since machine generated references dont look too good. I was forced to
implement something called a LIM (logical inheritance map) which simulates
the "path stucture" in a URL, so that it looks right from the client. I only
use the object reference when actually serving. /go/D00000023 is the same as
/go/ase/powerdev/D00000023.html as far the server is concerned.

I would also be most interest to hear discussion by anyone taking this approach.

That's  in there - there was some discussion on how best to handle 
this; there are three possiblities that need to be evaluated; only the first
is definitely in there. 

Fields in the MetaInformation record:

	inlined-objects   SEQUENCE OF URI OPTIONAL,
	linked-to-objects SEQUENCE OF URI OPTIONAL	

This allows the server to attach two lists of URIs to the metainformatin - 
one for inline objects, the other for links.

Flag in the GetRequest:

	send-inlined-objects BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE

This tells the server to automatically send all inlined-objects. This saves
a round trip, and helps to keep the window full, but needs careful tuning to
work well with client caches (the client can cancel individual streams, but 
because TCP is reliable, there may already be a windows worth of data in the 
pipeline.)

Options in the initialise request.

	send-unsolicited-objects BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE

This allows the server to send objects for which it hasn't recieved a direct 
request; this allows the server to send images automatically, but also allows 
commonly followed links to be pre-loaded. Unsolicited requests can be cancelled
or if accepted, acknowledged (this is needed to the prediction algorithms).

Many DTP programs put figures in frames which can then be anchored to the text 
flow, a particular point on the page, or whatever.

Close.

It is a program doing this, not the user. The program saves out each figure - 
not an image, a line drawing or diagram - and converts it to an image at 150 
dpi. By scaling down (this is called resampling in Photoshop) an antialiased 
image at 75dpi results, so that, say, a diagonal black line on a white 
background comes out as black pixels with grey ones at the edge. You would 
imagine this would make the image fuzzier - infact it removes annoying jaggies 
so the image looks higher resolution than it is.

It's a good time to lift up the rock and ask a few what, when, where,
how and why questions. (And I liked it, too).

What are the key areas that need to be addressed in the next rev of the
HTTP protocol? (performance, security, extensibility, xxx)

Why does the protocol need to be enhanced? (or why have we left it the way it
is for such a long time?)

When could a new version be specified/deployed? (summer 95?)

Who's ready willing and able to make it happen? (W3O)

How do we make a smooth transition to the new capabilities? 

Where can I get it :-)

Actually, I'm suggesting that an http working group be formed to flush
out the requirements and details of a next generation http spec, similar
to the excellent work that has been done in the html working group for
a verifiable and well documented HTML 2.0.

This is the place that I always get confused in separating out the responsibility
of the protocol on the wire for HTTP and the features I expect to see supported
from an HTML document authoring system. To follow from your example above the
next objects transmitted over the wire would look like this :

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE> Important to display this as soon as possible (warm fuzzies for users)</TITLE>
	....
	<<Processing instructions, list of inlined images, list of related hrefs,... >>
</HEAD>

In other words, a document header is accessible with a minimal amount of
processing and may contain equally valuable processsing instructions at
an application level. If this information is in the HTML HEAD, it could be
possible to acheive similar savings over other transport schemes (ftp, gopher,
wais, etc.)

When I divide up the processing, I'd like to see the document authoring 
system take responsibility for most of the content specific processing 
as possible. e.g. A list of inline images with their timestamps and sizes
could easily be produced when a document is "published" into a particular
document server's 'database' (in today's terms this translates into a user
can manually add the directives to the header of their document or run a
script to update the header information when they copy it to the publicly 
accessible file system). 

If we intend for the server to parse documents and take action before the
client has determined what they will do with the information, there will need
to be some additional dialog upfront where the client can communicate its
"intentions" about the information it has requested. e.g. I'd rather have 
10,000 clients parse the document and determine what actions to take than
to have the server parse the same document 10,000 times while the next 10,000
requests are waiting. Best of all I'd rather have the document author wait 
while their document is checked for errors and optimized for rapid retrieval
just once so all 10,000 of us could enjoy the benefits.

Rob - the prelim tests I did were based on fetching lots of small documents
from unc to HP labs in Bristol. The bandwidth was estimated by fetching a large
file (2Mb) using raw TCP. 

I've also done some more tests this morning (when the network connection is 
less busy). To get a more realistic idea of real-world performance, I used
as a data set the sunsite home page, and one instance of each of its inline
images. I ran the servers on tipper to eliminate any noise from the sunsite
net load (it's a different T1 to the campus one). Total size was ~48K, split
up between 5 files.  


HTTP 1.0 gave an average transfer time of 24.7 seconds. HTTP-NG 0.9 had an 
average time of around 5 seconds

The same test, using a machine at Ventana Media (In NC, but routed via DC),
gave an average time for HTTP-TOS of around 5.6 seconds, with HTTP-NG 
clocking around 1.5 seconds.

  Sounds like what you want is something akin to the already-specified
'link' tag.  For something like a navigational panel, you could do:

<head>
 <link rel="made" href="mailto:wmperry@spry.com">
 <link rel="toc" href="url-of-table-of-contents">
 <link rel="previous" href="url-of-parent-document">
 <link rel="next" href="url-of-next-document">
 <link rel="blah" href="someurl">
 <title>Some HTML document</title>
</head>

  Then you could create a 'mail to author' link, table of contents, back,
forward, etc, buttons.  Perhaps a SRC and ALIGN attribute similar to the
<img> and <fig> tags could be used to specify an image to use instead of
reasonable defaults per browser.

This is a good point and something which I think should be bourne in mind
when designing any client-server system.  Due to the rapid growth of cheap
processing power we can often assume that the client machine will have
plentiful processing power but that the servers are likely to easily
become overloaded.  This is especially true if the server is handling a
popular service and is getting a very large number of transactions from
widely dispersed clients, each of which has slightly different
requirements (due to different local images caches, hardware platforms, etc).

Hopefully this sort of thing will become commonplace with the increased
use of validated HTML generators and browsers that flag HTML errors (after
all many of us use our browsers to check documents already - something
like Arena's ``Bad HTML'' is an excellent idea that all browser authors
should consider adopting IMHO).

I have a few issues with HTTP-NG, on on a protocol level it didn't appear
as if there was a PROTOCOL-VERSION byte in the headers.  Such things like
this are always important.
 
While it's great that you've created a session based control protocol,
so that you can take advantage of all of the years of development into
congestion control that TCP uses.  There are a few small issues...
 
A) Over the Internet transfering 5 10MB files simultaniously is better
done with 5 .. 20 TCP connections.  Becuase, if one TCP packet is lost
only 1 TCP connection drops into a timeout<->resend cycle. 
 
B) If one were transmitting real multimedia object over the chanels, 
having only one identified channel for data transmission make it harder
to do bandwidth reservation, since it is harder to determine if the
channel is a text file or a video stream.
 
I think the better thing to keep in mind with HTTP-NG is that is
a control channel that can transmit data (MGETs...) but has mechanisms
for allow easy creation of auxilariy data channels.  Sounds simple, 
but it should be supportable from a library level.
 
---
 
Also, how does your benchmarking of HTTP-NG compare with HTTP supporting
MGETs?  I would expect that they are within 10% of each other, since
most of the time saving is probably comming from the reduction in
TCP connection creation.

[ what are TRANSPARENT and OPAQUE how are they defined, used, etc... ]

I like this idea, there are some great potentials...  But, I would think
it would be better to make a "few" changes.

<Viewport WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=200 BG=colorname ISMAP>
<IMG XPOS=... YPOS=...  SRC=...  ALT=...>
<IMG XPOS=... YPOS=...  SRC=...  ALT=...>
<IMG XPOS=... YPOS=...  SRC=...  ALT=...>
<ANNOTATE XPOS=... YPOS=...> text to render </ANNOTATE>
</Viewport>

[ this is very close to a GIF image file ]

Instead of making an overlay are this is more of a drawport/viewport
on an collection of images and graphics.

This is similar to the other thread about graphing.  I think that
everybody clearly sees that HTML is graphically crippled.  Part of
the fundimental question is if it is better to extend HTML or work
on better imbedding schemes..  (ie is it better to extend HTML or
work on adding suport for imbedding anchors <A HREF=... INLINE>)

Actually, there was no protocol information at all in the documents posted :-)
That's all in the protocol spec, rather than the architectural overview.. 
A Draft of the spec will be out before the BOF - honest :-)
The current protocol-level options don't use version numbers; instead, they 
use capabilities. This is similar to the gnu style autoconf approach of 
finding out what features a machine supports, instead of using the system 
name to look up the feature list in a table).

This is true except... why did the one TCP packet get lost? Virtually all 
packet loss on the Internet is caused by congestion. (I'll need a bit to 
dig out the reference for the actual numbers, unless Dave Crocker knows them
off the top of his head?)

I can't quite follow this - how does this differ from the mechanism I proposed,
which allows results to be either a session_id for data on this connection
or a url for a media specific transport connection. If the HTTP-NG connection
has reserved bandwidth, then it can split time between the data channels as
it sees fit. 

>Also, how does your benchmarking of HTTP-NG compare with HTTP supporting

I haven't done the comparison, but I'd expect around a 25%-30% differce for
a document with a few images. A lot depends on how MGET is spec-ed, how

Certainly there is a lack of awareness about CGM, particularly the ammendments 
which were rolled in to make the newer 1992 edition of the standard. Perhaps 
this is because commonly available software still only generates and understands 
the earlier 1987 version of the standard. Do a search for CGMs on http and ftp 
sites - most are 1987 CGM generated by Corel Draw.

I hope you mean, the first sentence is wrong (which it is; thanks for the 
information about Amd. 2 which I was unaware of). The second one is, of course, 
correct.

OK so the ammendment, soon to form part of the standard, says how applications  
define application structures; it would be possible (but the standard does not 
say how)to use these to implement Web hotlinks. 

Problems with this, unless the precise method of doing so is defined - perhaps 
in an application profile - how do I know how a particular CGM encodes this 
particular information? 

Particularly since URLs are not an ISO standard, so a method for encoding Web 
links into a CGM cannot form part of an ISO standard. Perhaps as a non-normative 
annex. Thus, Sods law dictates that different industry groupings will pick at 
least two ways of doing this.

The problem of incompatible implementations, which was a significant one for 
CGM in the early years and which seems to have been largely dealt with by 
application profiles, looks set to rear it's head again.

One cannot assume that all CGMs met with on the net belong to a particular 
application profile. So the browser, or a viewer working in concert with the 
browser, has to understand all CGMs and the way in which each group of users has 
overlaid Web link information onto the Application Structures, so that hotlinks 
can be supported. This sounds like a recipie for browser bloat, to me.

Furthermore, the hotlinks would then be intimately associated with the CGM, so 
if you want to use the same CGM in different situations you need to make copies 
of the CGM and edit the Application Structures to suit.

It is not at all obvious that this is the way to proceed.

HTML 3 FIG elements define hotlinks and active regions in a standardised way for 
all inline figures, to allow 

- client side processing
- user feedback such as cursor changes or URLs shown as the user 
  moves over an active area
- automatic support for non-imaging clients (text prowsers, browsers for 
  the print impaired)

Provided the units can be ems as well as pixels, as is done with other parts of 
the HTML 3 sketch DTD, then in conjunction with the width and height attributes 
of the FIG element this support could be trivially extended to inline vector 
graphics, inline movies, etc doing all this in a consistent way.

This would also allow a form-driven CGI script to generate HTML as required with 
different hot areas on the same CGM (which, being in the browser cache, will 
greatly speed up responsiveness to the user).

Using the Application Structures to implement hot areas would remove all these 
advantages for CGM, while providing none, that I can see, in return. 

A different way of working  for one content type among many - is this desirable?

> Products are already being built and sold which use these standard CGM
> features!

I would be interested in a list of these, particularly ones which embed URLs (as 
opposed to other hyperlinking technologies) and which are either free, or 
shareware at, say, less than US$ 25.00

Pointers to freely available code libraries to parse the latest version of CGM 
would also be appreciated.

People said that in 1987 about CGM ;-)

Also this is obfuscation; as Lofton is well aware, putting all "graphics" 
formats in one basket is hardly comparing like with like. Placing these as data 
capture metafiles on a Computer Graphics Reference Model, we see rather less 
than the stated "90" files in the Viewing Environment, where CGM sits. I can 
think of EPS, Adobe Illustrator EPS, Coreltrace EPS (think of these as 
application profiles using subsets of EPS to allow editing) and DXF. These all 
have different characteristics, even within the one environment. DXF provides 
features, for example, that EPS does not and vice verca.

So, my original comment still stands: A new format is fine if it does a 
different job (if not, it is not fine). Surely Lofton does not argue with this?

Reading the original propsal for moline, it seems that some thought has gone 
into the proposal which I assume Lofton read before commenting on it. I would 
therefore be interested to hear his specific objections to it, apart from the 
fact that it has not settled on CGM. Then again, it has not NOT settled on it 
either, as the paper makes clear.

Does anyone have Jodi Moline's email address?

Why not? Any particular reason, or a vague feeling?

The head area is not intended for this sort of information. Your proposed top 
and bottom tags would contain information to be displayed in the document, so on 
that basis they should go in the body element

On the other hand, the suggestion seemed to be that the document window be split 
into three, with the central part scrolling. Given that the top and bottom 
areas, which might be multiple lines or contain various sized images, would be 
of different sizes - or not present at all - this would require a new scrolling 
display widget for each document which could prove expensive on some systems.

Browsers that parse the HTML as it streams in, and display it before the stream 
has finished, would need to know about the top and bottom elements early on. 
Perhaps, in HTML 3, which I believe can contain multiple body parts .... yup he 
said, checking, the top and bottom parts could have their own body parts 
restricted to come before the others.

Eg

<doctype stuff><html>
<head> etc</head>
<body role=top> top stuff>
<body role=bottom> bottom stuff>
<body> body material</body>
<body> another bunch of body material</body>
</html>

Better yet, the sketch DTD says "Note that multiple body sections are permitted 
and that you can specify whether a section floats or is glued to one of the 
window sides"

Depending on whether you describe a rectangolar window as having two or four 
sides ;-) this might provide exactly what is being asked for, without any 
extensions.

Congestion is an biggest reason.  It does happen and depending on where
you are attached to the network it might happen a _LOT_.  I spent a
good chunk of time using the Internet on a regular basis from Tromsoe 
Norway where it took 10 .. 17 hops to get to my destinations.  Lots
of packets were lost in their travels, some days it approached 10%
of the packets, and it was consistantly 2% loss.

How about for an MGET:
	[ connect ]

	GET foo.html HTTP/2.0
	..accepts, etc..
	HTTP/2.0 200 OK		<- a 1.0 server acks with a HTTP/1.0 
	..data..

	[ connection stays open ]

	MGET xxx.gif yyy.gif zzz.gif

	[ shipped in one of the packet protocols that has been discussed ]

This avoids that close/connect cycle that you mention.  Also, fully 
compatable with existing servers.

This needs a more detailed response, but here's a few instant sound bites :-)

1) Working group
   Should be one set up after the BOF at the IETF in San Jose next month

2) What is needed- I  outlined a few of these in the architectural overview
    more will undoubtedly be presented at the BOF and WGs

3) Why change - I also outlined the rationale for changing in the overview -
    this is expanded in the HTML version (to be made available when
    Dave gets back from London tommorow.

4) When - part of the design criteria was the need to have something that
    could work well in a phased transition - the proxy approach works really 
    well for this - in theory there only need be two machines running the new 
    protocol either side of a long pipe, and all old clients could proxy through
    them to see a huge speedup (need to be pretty hefty machines though :-)

5) Servers parsing documents - This is fine, providing the results are cached.
    One of the problems with server-side includes is that because they aren't
    referential transparent, you can't in general cache the results.

OK, fine, except no mention of this non-binding statement in

<http://west.ubique.com/Beta/beta_agreement.html>

which states

> 16. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Licensee and
> Ubique with respect to Beta Test Software Evaluation

So, the welcome statement is misleading at best. And also

So, we get to use this software for the test, and maybe afterwards (but not
unless the existing license is changed) and we don't get to talk about it or
ever disclose the fact that we have or had the software.  That might make
finding friends to chat to on your virtual server a little hard, don't you 
think?

Oh and from  
  <http://ubique.com/Lobby/infodesk/virtual_places_lecture/slide6.html> 

So, the architecture is subject to a patent application. Cool.

David - 
  Adding the MGET and multi-connection extensions on top of HTTP 1.0 still
leads to a dual stack apparoach - you can't leverage the existing code to 
implement the extensions - you need to build the packetisation protocols 
from scratch. Implementing the ascii based packetisation protocols is 
much harder that implementing something like SCP. Because all the control  
information is variable length, reading the control information and buffering it
is much harder than for a fixed length header. One example of this problem you
might have encountered comes in dealing with post requests (esp. with CGI). 
When you read the header, you'll almost certainly end up with some of the 
request data in your buffer. This data has to then be passed through to the 
CGI process, along with the reset of the data that may still be in the pipe.

Another problem with the HTTP style of encoding can be seen if you try 
writing an event based server. Because you can't tell if you've finished
reading a request until you've hit the newline. Because the request can 
span multiple reads, you need to keep track of a lot of parser state in a 
way that lets you continue when more data arrives.  

The backwards compatibility mode for HTTP-NG currently starts off each 
conection with a short header that will trigger method unknown from old servers.
If this were changed to be the HTTP/1.0 version of  the first request (if such
a translation is possible, the level of backwards compatibility would be 
identical. 
The advantage of using a fixed header is that it avoids having to try and parse
a variable length header. The disadvantage is that the need to retry the
connection the first time that a particular host is encountered (after that,
the protocol of that host is cached)

It's even possible to use HTTP 1.0 syntax within SCP packetisation to get 
some of the performance win - however, this approach doesn't address issues
like negotiation and charging, and still leaves you with all the headaches of
parsing the ad-hoced syntax.

As is the case with Internet companies (cf. the Netscape beta
agreement) it takes time to synch with lawyers.  You will have to trust
us on that.  Part of the lawyers work is done, as we made sure that our
(binding!) agreement with NCSA permits us to give free copies of Sesame

Thanks for the comment, which was also pointed out by Pavel Curtis.
We will fix this so that it makes sense.

Security is being handled separately. The question of how we get in sync
with the binary mode stuff is a good one. The security extensions are 
cpompatible with the RFC-822 header stuff of HTTP/1.0 and should also be
applicable to the binary version. The question is whether to introduce the
security enhancements and the unpgrade to binary or do it all in one step.

Mainly its for interactive stuff that does not work with the single Request/
Response idea of HTTP/1.0

W3O and W3C.

|>How do we make a smooth transition to the new capabilities?

Good question. The clients would initialy make a request using HTTP/1.0, if
the reply says that HTTP/2.0 is going to be well received then the next request
uses that. The start of the request can be adapted so that HTTP/1.0 servers
just barf immediately and safely so that later on when there are more HTTP/2.0
servers than 1.0 ones the default is the new protocol.

This sort of thing really needs to have a server where there is a proper
`add new entry command'. If UNIX weren't 95% lossage then we could add a
method to the write file operation that extracted the metainformation
and stored it somewhere usefull. To do this well needs a server backed up
by a database or persistent object store of some sort.


Perhaps what we could do is to mount a database volume onto a UNIX filestore
in such a way that to UNIX it looked like a directory but when a file was
written the meta information would be cached.

The <LINK> element in the <HEAD> element seems to do what you want with the
exception of the <ISMAP> and icon functionality.

Check out this nasty URL:

Since it is meta-information concerning the place of this document WRT other
objects, the <HEAD> element is the proper place.  Since this is already present 
in the HTML 2.0 spec, no extention would be necessary, but browsers would need
to be given the smarts to render it.

Exactly.  And if you check the www-talk archives you will see a proposal
from me for a section called <NAV>...</NAV> about a year and half ago that
proposes pretty much exactly this.

Then they can just ignore it.  Presention should be left to the browser
as much as possible, as always.

My proposal was that it go between <HEAD> and <BODY>.

> <body role=bottom> bottom stuff>
It's very bad to put structural information inside the attributes,
if you use <NAV> then you can validated the document against the DTD,
you cannot do that if it is inside an attribute.

I have been very leery of the Client-side imagemaps, and the prospect of vector
images makes me moreso.  One problem with the client-side approach is that it
is not very scalable.  I run several imagemaps now with over 50 hotspots, and
those of us in the GIS/Mapping industry have several applications waiting in
the wings which could conceivably have thousands of hotspots.  I don't think
anyone would want these encoded in the HTML code.  In my mind, the best place
to encode these is within the file itself (I say that because I would probably
be generating the files on-the-fly, not using existing CGM files).

The other problem denotes that you seem to have missed one of the advantages
of Softsource's proposal (which could just as easily be done with CGM), which
is the ability of the browser/viewer to do zooming and panning on the file.
How would moving targets be handled with client-side imagemap definitions?

The first two of your three points above can be done with graphics-file-
encoded imagemaps just as easily as client-side.  I believe all three imagemap
methods have their merits for different situations, and would like to see them
all stick around.

About the standardization of CGM: I don't think it is any more difficult to
have a working group build a standard WWW CGM profile than to build SVF.

Vision:  Vector support can impact much more than distributing engineering
drawings.  If it is done right, it can lend a whole new metaphor to
the WWW.  Designers could use either (preferably both, for graphics-impaired
users) a text-based metaphor (HTML) or a truly visual-based one (SVF/CGM),
both with the same hypertext capabilities.  The two metaphors should be
compatible, but separable (i.e. I should have a graphics-based browser which
can include HTML text as part of an image, as well as vice versa).

Well, remember that in the FHTTP model the delivery stream of the 
document is separate from the delivery stream for the meta-information;
and if the client could completely avoid having to look in the document 
delivery stream for pointers on what to do, that would seem to be a good 
thing (though maybe I'm misinterpreting the model.)  

Also, I think we should be thinking along the lines of making HTML and HTTP
as orthogonal as possible - HTTP should be as completely functional when the
WWW is SGML aware, too.

Remember that I suggested the server only parse the document once and 
cache that info for later accesses, not parse it with each access (though 
doing a quick stat to see if the file had changed would be needed, but I 
think that's done somewhere in the process anyways for the last-modified 
line).

Which brings up the idea again that the HTML the client sees should possibly
be different than the HTML the author creates.  That sounds fine, I'd
just counter that it might not be the right level of generalization....

There are still too many boxes out there that drop the main packet

Some of us are (unfortunately) behind some major US providers which
experience as much as a 50% packet loss rate on bad days and 20% and
above is quite common.

Now, if TCP/IP engines would do Path MTU discovery and quit sending
those little 500+ byte packets whenever something goes off their

My intent was that some images have transparent areas that let the
previously-listed images show through.  GIF89a has a mechanism for specifying
this, but all browsers I know of implement only the simple case where the
background shows through, not a second underlying image.  In this example, the
magnifying glass would be annular -- just the frame would be opaque.  The lens
would be transparent, letting the closeup show through.  (Also, since images
are rectangular and magnifying glasses are round, the corners of the image,
outside the round frame, need to be transparent, letting the big map show
through.)

I probably didn't need to include explicit HTML keywords for TRANSPARENT and
OPAQUE, since the image itself can specify it.  I was just trying to make the
intent more explicit by including as much as possible.  Similarly, the width
and height are specified in the image, but I noticed that
http://home.mcom.com/ uses explicit dimensions (in their case, to allow
Mozilla to leave a blank space for the image so it can begin rendering the
text below it before even starting to download the image).

Fine with me.  (BTW, "ALT" probably makes sense on Viewport than on IMG.)
If the term "viewport" also implies being able to display a subset of a
downloaded image, that would be even better; it would allow almost-smooth
scrolling because the whole image is cached on the local machine.

Sorry, I don't follow most of WWW-Talk, I just skim the archives occasionally
for relevant threads.  I should take a look at that one sometime.

Here's a reference.  If there's a later document somewhere, I don't know about it.
        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_35.html
It doesn't seem to support overlaying anything over the figure, just wrapping
text around it and typesetting a caption near it.

A relatively recent agreement between ISO and IETF allows ISO
standards to reference IETF standards (and vice versa, although that
wasn't a problem before).

The URL document is standards-track, but of course it isn't a standard
yet. However, given the (historical) relative pace of IETF vs. ISO
standards process, perhaps this won't be an issue.

I'm new to the field and so appologize in advance for putting my foot
in my mouth but --
-- has anyone thought of including a way in HTML for inserting optional
prosodic markers before important text elements?  I envision a string
of "/____-__-___\"  or something like that to tell a voice gen browser
how to inflect the next phrase (rather than using it's defaults), 
thus identifying links in the document for those who can't see
the screen.
I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to come up with a short 
list of recommended prosidic marker defaults for most common text
elements...
Thanks!
Dick S.

Does client side capability for imagemap handling preclude doing it on the 
server in those cases where that would be the better choice?

OK, done with either the browser or an embedded helper application.

Fine, that is a problem. I had talked of moving from pixel units to physical 
measurements (the HTML 3 sketch dtd uses ems) which would be needed anyway if 
images were to be resampled to particular sizes (at the moment there is a one to 
one pixel mapping in most browsers).

Perhaps that was not going far enough. Vector files define a world coordinate 
system. Descriptions of hot locations should of course use that coordinate 
system which would then deal happily with scrolling, resizing etc.

I am tending to agree with you.

Certain people agree with you. I will seek permission from one such to post one

Is there any particular reason a voice gen browser cannot just use the <a> and 
</a> tags to identify links? This seems to me a simpler and better solution and 
is I presume what existing voice browsers use.

Hi, 

the CERN httpd 3.0 generates the LogFileDateExt only with GMT ignoring
the LogTime switch to LocalTime.

I've written a small patch for the HTLog.c source to create the 
LogFileDateExt with the local time if the LogTime is set to LocalTime
in the httpd.conf.


Bye bye Thorsten

ps. If the LogFileDateExt is set to %y%m%d you get a more useful
    log-extension for scripts.

Great minds think alike!

Actually, I have already set the ball in motion for this. I ran a BOF on this
at the recent WWWF'94 conference, and will be doing the same at the IETF
meeting next month in San Jose, where we will be formally requesting the
settting up of an IETF HTTP working group. The mailing list for the new group
has already been set up, although its fairly quiet at the moment.

I just did some packet traces comparing the effects of multiple connections
versus sending the same amount of data over a single connection. For the
test case I looked at, I discovered that the parallel connections did indeed
take less wall-clock time. However, they also caused an increase in the number 
of data packets sent of over 22% due to retransmissions. 

>From this we see that the mutli connect version increases the amount of 
bandwidth available to a particular user *at the expense of reducing the total 
amount of bandwidth available*. 

The extra bandwidth for this user is coming at the expense of other users- 
thus we have a classic instance of the tragedy of the commons.

Hi all,

Is it reasonable to expect browsers which don't understand Netscape's
PROMPT in ISINDEX to work properly ?

I've had a report that Cello doesn't give the user an ISINDEX prompt
if the PROMPT="some better prompt" attribute is used.

regards,
rob

While the need for an <ISINDEX PROMPT="xyz">
was discussed on www-talk, as far as I know netscape is the only
browser that implements it.  Other browsers will probably just ignore
the PROMPT="" info and supply their own default prompt.

I've seen Mosaic and Lynx ignore the PROMPT, but more worrying is Cello's
refusal to give even a default prompt.

The question is, is a browser broken if it fails to give even a default
prompt when a prefered prompt is specified ?. I think and hope the answer
is yes.

Right.  This sort of thing is one of the recurring themes on the
end2end-interest list;  every now and then some bright spark announces
a shiny new protocol that outperforms TCP, and is gently reminded that
if everyone used it the results would be much worse than with modern
TCP implementations.

We _really_ don't want a repeat of the meltdown that originally prompted 
Van Jacobson's work on TCP congestion avoidance.  FHTTP, and also the HTTP
modifications proposed and analyzed in 

    http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/IT94/Proceedings/DDay/mogul/HTTPLatency.html

seem to be headed in the right direction;  multiple parallel TCP connections,
on the other hand, are pretty disturbing.

The latest Netscape browser license is a little worrying..
We interpret it as saying, 

 "You can use this browser for free at the moment, but we can stop you 
using it at any time in the future."

The wording may have been similar in previous releases, but now they
are forcing the user to hit a button to "Agree" to these terms.

Are Netscape just covering their backs or do they intend to get
everyone addicted to Mozilla before they pull the rug from under us ?

I hope they're just covering their backs. If not their plans must be
to suffocate all the other browsers before announcing their prices; this
could backfire.. we've all seen how quickly the masses can abandon one ship
(NCSA Mosaic) in favour of a better AND free alternative.

Also, if a commercial version of Mozilla were to be released, then a lot
beta testing by the users would go unrewarded. They would have been using
us all as free bug finders and suggestion consultants.

Comments ?

I'm guessing you're referring to the sentence:

     Upon termination of this License, or in
     any event within thirty (30) days following
     Netscape's release of a commercial version
     of the Software, you agree to destroy or
     erase the Software.

I've been beta testing software for many years, and I can't ever remember 
anything similar.

Conspiracy theorists in every www forum have proposed this (with varying 
degrees of venom involved.) It makes no sense.  Representatives from 
Netscape Comm., including Marc, have said repeatedly and in many 
different public forums that Netscape will continue to be free to 
individuals after it leaves the beta stage.  Does it make good business 
sense to say "Oh yeah, we were lying," and expect that to have no 
adverse consequences?

This is just ludicrous.  They are well aware of how fast the scenery can 
change in the WWW world; many of the NCSA developers work there!

That's what beta testers do.  Nobody compelled anyone to beta test, and 
the terms of the license were available during the beta stage.

> Comments ?

I do have a comment.  I suggest that people stop attributing to malice 
that which can be ascribed to typical legalese, and not theorize that 
companies are intending to reverse 180 degrees from their current 
position without some hard evidence.  Thank you.

This sounds like a client-side style issue.  Just as links and other

presumably be aurally distinctive in aural browsers.

If a browser understands the base tag but not an attribute, the entire 
tag should not be ignored.  This probably isn't terribly well defined; 
browsers should really support a strict subset of HTML and all tags 
defined therein, but the malleability of the spec and the way it has 
evolved makes that difficult.  Imagine if browsers that don't support <P 
ALIGN="CENTER"> ignored the paragraph tag altogether.

And a lot of us believe Marc is telling the truth here, 
but why can't the license say this ?

The license has more legal value than any denials or guarantees
in newsgroups or mailing lists.

Who knows where Marc will be working 6 months or a year from now.

but their license does give them this option, which is potentially bad
news for anyone wanting to use it for free in the longterm. Why not
remove this worry altogether by rewording the license.

Doesn't the license state their current position better than informal
comments ?

All this Netscape demonizing is getting tiresome...

The company chose to release a free browser because it's in their
business interest to do so.  I'm not privy to Marc and Jim's private
thoughts, but according to everything I've read about them
in the trade press, they intend to make most of their money selling
servers.  So they are highly motivated to maximize their share of the
browser market any way that they can.

They recently released a version on Linux, after all.  Surely you don't
think that Marc is planning to buy his Porsche with revenue from a bunch of
cheapskates (like myself) who won't even spring for a *real* OS?

Even if Netscape were to take away the free browser and start charging for
it, what have you lost?  There are several other browsers out there, and 
you can always buy another one, use the NCSA free one, or write your own.

Reasonable people can debate the relative merits of the various NCOM
technical and business decisions, but it doesn't make sense to paint them
as monopolists.  Like most entrepreneurs, they're winning some and they're
losing some.  As bright as their team of people is, they're just not big
enough to drive this market in the foreseeable future.  And based on what I
know about them, I believe they're smart enough to recognize that and act
accordingly.

Cheers,
Stefan

At the risk of sounding stupid, I pose this question;  is there an httpd 
server type program for windows (preferably, one that handles HTML+, but 
i'll take anything)??  This is going to be used for local devlopment only, 
and will not interact with the rest of the internet/world/anyone else.  
Anyone have a pointer?

	This flap over whether or not they are going to give it
	away free forever is amazing considering that freeware is,
	by its nature, not to be depended on 'forever.'  Some freeware
	lasts, is supported, and is good stuff.  Other freeware dies 
	and replacements must be found.  My personal feeling is that
	one ought to pay for software.  I had someone come in to my
	office today and tell me that he and a friend each own a computer
	and they 'share' their software.  When I explained that I had no
	sympathy with that approach he said he HAD to have the software
	and couldn't afford to buy it.  I know that there is a 
	responsible body of opinion out there that believes that software
	should be free... I am only stating my own opinion.  But I doubt
	that even those who believe as a matter of philosophy that software
	should be free think that stealing it is mine.  

	Well, I digress.  People are entitled to payment for the work of
	their intellect if they want payment.

Hi .. I have a problem regarding setting Mosaic 2.4 to work properly on
my Irix Indigo OS 4.0.1. Presently, we have a firewall using SOCKS betw
internet and our domain. I have successfully compiled Mosaic 2.4 and link
ok. However, upon activation, it give me error that the ncsa server
refuse to sent me file or can't connect. The socks port n server is ok
as all other rftp, rtelnet, etc are working properly. I have remarked
off the WAIS and DTM in the Mosaic Makefile.

Presently, my system does not have a DNS, I tried setting it with one in
resolv.conf but still doesn't work. Kindly advise.

Thanks

Could you expand on that. What about 1.1, 1.x, 2.x, x.x etc....
I know this is looking a lot further ahead than you probably want to,
but a small hint would be nice :)

Our current intent is to do so, but absolutely do not consider that
to be a binding commitment.  I also will not guarantee that
the free and for-$$$ versions won't diverge at some point in the
future (almost certainly not for 1.0, though).  What happens post-1.0 
will mostly be determined by market and business factors over the next 
few years.

Free client distribution (again, for personal, educational, and research
use, roughly stated) is a core part of both the philosophy and the 
business model of the company, and has several very strong motivating 
reasons behind it, and we take it very seriously.

Cheers,
Marc

My guess is that Netscape sans security will be freely available, and
that the interest generated among businesses in secure http transactions
(Netsite Commerce Server and Netscape Commerce Client?) will take up the 
core of NComm's business.  Am I far off Marc?

Unfortunately, yes -- the freely available client will have security.
The only real question is whether it will have export-grade or US-only-grade
security, and that's purely a matter of US Government export law and policy
at this point.

Grrr.. ISINDEX is brain damaged anyway. Whether or not a server supports
indexing is a property of the server, not of the document. IMVHO the use
of ISINDEX should be discouraged. Instead, servers should return
the header element
     Public: TEXTSEARCH
instead (see also http://info.cern.ch/
     hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html
for details). Nobody uses it. :-(

For user interfaces, FORMs are more convinient anyway. There is no need
to add special gizmos to ISINDEX. If, on the other hand, we had a well
defined behaviour for ISINDEX, and a way of communicating the "Server
supports indexing" between server and client, there'd be an access
point for automatic resource discovery and indexing tools like
Harvest and ALIWEB.

(now where's that asbestos suit..)

Forwarding note for Craig I. Johnson (original IBM internal appendee
who does not subscribe to this list)

Ref:  Your note of Wed, 23 Nov 1994 08:55:30 +0000 (GMT) 

Based on the responses, I would like to further clarify, although you'll
notice, I'm a little ambivalent about which way things are done here.
                                                                            
The interpretation of what I wanted is correct - albeit somewhat confused
by everyone's different interpretation of 'head', vs 'heading' vs. 'header'.
I really don't care what they are called: They could be: top_toolbar,
bottom_toolbar, or side_toolbar for all I care as far as the 'navigational'purposes are concerned. There IS however an alternative use which would
in fact correspond to bookmaster 'headers' and 'footers'. - For instance,
the requirement that one display 'company confidential' on each page of
a doc could be satisfied by keeping it there in the top header/toolbar, (sic)
and the data of record to be kept in that or the bottom one. THis is a
different purpose from what I originally intended, but things like ISO9000
standards might require such an approach for such info.
In fact, now that I think about this, the headers and footers could be used
for these purposes, while a side toolbar would satisfy my orignal
navigation requiremenst. If this approach were taken, it seems to me that
the browser which format while they scroll could adapt to modifying the
top and bottom (header and footer) "thingies" as the new tags were encountered
(this of course would confuse a formattter that did its work BEFORE displaying.

Thanks for passing this on.

Hi,

I haven't heard much in recent months about the long awaited scalable
group annotations that NCSA were supposed to be working on and so I
thought it was about time to prod the group.  I noticed in the
documentation at CERN that there is a document describing REL link
relationships attributes for <A> tags
(<URL:http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Relationships.html>) which
could be used to point browsers at specific annotation servers for
different documents and even allow new annotations to be sent to different
servers to that which the original annotation came from.  Has any progress
been made on group annotations or do any browsers support the use of the
experimental REL attributes for this purpose? 

Jon

Correct me where I am wrong... But:

CGM is a 2 dimensional vector format. Clearly an in-line vector
format is necessary, but surely we should not limit it to 2D images
from the outset.

These are all properties of general document management systems, some
of which are built on database engines. However, rather than try to
retrofit web servers into document management systems, building
HTTP/web interfaces to any of the commercial document management
systems (PC Docs, Soft Solutions, Documentum, Visual Recall, Saros
Mezzanine, etc.) might be a simpler way to proceed.

Subject: Map File Format general?
content-length: 248


Is the map file format general or is it HTTP server type dependent?
If it's general: why can't you specify a link to a specific section i a 
document (path/doc.htm#page4) in the map file?
Are there any workarounds?

Thanks!

The above question wasn't answered though - can I set up a WWW site,
using the Netscape Commerce server, and expect to have a wide user
base for the security, etc, features, because the Netscape client is
freely usable?  I.E. is a license fee/some form of payment necessary
for legitimate corporate use?  If not, as I'm sure you can see, demand
for the commerce server is greatly reduced, as it's potential 
competitive advantages - namely the extra features it offers - are not
so advantageous . . .

Of course, if the server features are available from other browsers also,
then this is not a disadvantage.  Is this part of the game plan?

Oh, and while we're at it, any other aspects of your business plan you'd 
like to share?  :)

I can answer for the EMWAC Windows NT HTTP server.  The same 
answer probably applies to other servers.

You can't specify a URL of the form /foo/bar.htm#xxx
in a map file because the *browser* interprets the #xxx, not the 
server.

> Are there any workarounds?

Specify the full URL http://mymachine.mydomain/foo/bar.htm#xxx
This should cause the server to issue a 302 Found response with
a Location: header containing the URL.  Then the browser retrieves 
/foo/bar.htm and interprets the #xxx locally.

Ho ho. <g>  I ought to have pointed out that we are an educational site, use
the NCSA server at present and would like to know if we can rely on
Netscape being freely available for our staff and students to use.  The
additional features the commercial sector want/need are not really
important for us - and neither are the details of mcom's business plan. ;-)

I believe that Marca has answered the above query and I shall act ("rely" in
the matter of simple contract law) on that assumption.

Once again, thank you for this.

The thread discussing the overlaying of inline bitmaps is both
interesting and informative. I cant help thinking that its scope is
somewhat limited however.

I would like to be able to overlay *anything* onto anything else.

Specifically I would have thaught the ability to overlay bitmaps with
vector images to be most useful, but I would go further and suggest
that the ability to overlay a bitmap with text would not be an
unreasonable request.

This logic would surely lead to a generic view of inline objects, be
they: bitmaps, vector graphic files, frames containing text,
animations, sound files, or smelly feely files?:-)
And that *any* combination could be placed in any combination on a
"page".

Argghh!  Could we just drop this whole thread?  It just keeps
returning, in one variant or another.  The mail ranges from vile
slanders to well-intentioned advice, but none of it is appropriate.
This email list is www-talk not mcom-talk or talk.politics.mcom.  We
should be talking about how to improve or replace HTTP, or how to get
more powerful interaction into HTML, or how to facilitate resource
discovery, or how to do shared annotation, but not about the business
model of MCom.  

Fact is, they are set up to make a profit, and one would expect they
will make rational decisions about how to maximize that, while at the
same time considering (to some extent) what's good for the world at
large.  But I doubt that the discussions here will affect what MCom
decides.  It's just useless to use this forum to complain about or try
to affect MCom.  It just wastes space and time.  And for that matter,
if you want to worry about a corporate giant on the web, consider
Microsoft.  But please, not here.

If there were a FAQ for this list, I would add:

Q1) Should I complain about Netscape's license?

A: No.

with all best wishes

PS If you disagree, then please reply to me only, or just ignore me.
I am even less interested in a discussion of whether to discuss MCom
than in the discussion of MCom per se.

seriously, with all best wishes

The map file format IS HTTPD-specific. For example, the format for the 
NCSA server is different from that for the CERN server.

For info on setting up an imagemap for each of these servers, have a look at:

<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Guide.html">CERN 
Server User Guide</A>

<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html">NCSA Server 
Overview</A>

I'm not sure if you can reference a specific location in a document, and 
this is a good question.

Anbody?

Typically the file format is 'imagemap' or 'htimage' dependant.  But,
using HTTP/1.0 and a "good" IMAP backend there is no reason why you
shouldn't be able to say 'path/doc.html#page'.

Though most servers presently take 'Location:' headers and send you the
document rather than leaving it at that.  If you run NCSA HTTPD there
are some straight forward things you can change to make it not
send the document but rather send just the reference and allow the browser
to refetch the document.

I'm happy to point out that our search engine is OEMed by, and thus built
into PC Docs, Documentum, Saros and others.  I'm not sure about the other
ones you mention here (I'm not in the office or I could look it up).  This
means that the indexes built by those systems can be directly served by our
Web server.

I think this helps demonstrate that the combination of a relational
database and a full-text database is much more powerful than either one
alone.  It also shows why our strategy of OEMing aggressively is making it
possible to use our various tools to tie together information from a number
of sources.

Subject: Passing highlight information in URLs
content-length: 2341

I'd like to raise an issue that's beginning to become important in our Web
strategy.  As you may know, when search engines return documents, they
typically include "highlights," which are some kind of markup and/or
navigational aid that shows why the document matched the query.  For
example, if you search on "web and publishing," the document might be
returned with the words "web" and "publishing" in boldface.  From a
navigational standpoint, you'd usually want to open the document to the
first occurrence of the highlights, then be able to use a single keystroke
to jump from one to the next.

I think we need a generalized approach to passing highlights among viewers,
via URLs.  The idea is that whenever a server or a viewer tells a viewer to
open, it's also able to pass the highlight information.  Otherwise, the
server or viewer would have to proxy every document in order to add
highlights.

Inevitably, there are going to be multiple viewers launching one another,
I've come to accept.  There's Mosaic and its kin, Acrobat, Panorama,
various other SGML viewers, plus proprietary ones such as our client-server
products.  Clearly all want to be able to launch one another as helpers, if
not as peers.  For example, we want to be able to search Web indexes in our
own viewer, then launch an HTML browser to view the document.

I think that the inefficiency of proxying is obvious, but I'll say it
anyway, with an extremely inefficient example.  Let's say you're in
California and you search a server in the UK.  One of the resulting
documents is on your own network.  If the server has to do the
highlighting, it'll have to retrieve the document from California, do the
markup, then pass it back to California.  If it can simply pass the URL
with highlight information, then your viewer can retrieve the document
locally and do the highlighting.

Obviously (I think), there should be a standard way to pass this kind of
information, useful to a variety of kinds of viewers and browsers.

I'd be especially interested in comments from those who are doing viewers
and browsers for the various non-HTML document types, since that's where
I'd assume that our shared knowledge is thinnest.

Nick

Netscape is wonderfull and the netscape licence is bogus.  Send in your $99
and enjoy.  People need to be encouraged to use it, not discouraged by the
lousey licence.  Send your complaints directly to mcom.com, not to the list.

Mosaic and Netscape only partially fulfill our dream.  The best brouwers
are yet to come.  CERN, NCSA, MCOM and the rest deserve our support.  If 
they are too cautious or greedy the revolution will bypass them...

Most people I know will not use Netscape due to the licence.  I agree,
this is a crime and something should be done about it.

Netscape fan, jim@njit.edu

p.s. use their feedback form, the list has been saturated on this issue.

I really thought that I was going to let this thread die, but I 
can't help myself. Don't pay $99 if you can wait a short while. 
According to the MCI announcement it looks like they will be packaging 
it with some PPP package and selling the lot for $49. At least thats 
what their hype release said.

I'd be happy to pay $$ for netscape.  Its very nice software.

Thank you Mosaic, oops, Netscape Communications.

(BTW, NCom -- did you ever resolve that issue with Cisco over the fact
that they claim to own the trademark "Netscape"?  [See the copyright
link from http://www.cisco.com?])

FYI, $99 is our single-copy baseline price, primarily intended

The Netsite servers speak two protocols -- standard HTTP, and standard
HTTP plus SSL.  SSL is freely available and implementable, has been
proposed to the relevant standards body (W3O), etc.  We certainly
encourage other browsers to implement it -- see the URLs I sent out
earlier for more info.  We'll fully support other/future industry
security standards as they emerge.

Subject: .ps.gz problem in Netscape
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
content-length: 1537

Hi,

  I don't know if I should use this list to talk about this, but the guys from
Netscape are not answering me and I think that someone must have this problem
(hopefully solved). So, here it goes.

  I use mostly the Internet for research purposes and I come across many sites
with papers in the .ps.gz or .dvi.gz format. 
  
Mosaic's behavior for those formats is to gunzip the document and then 
	showing it.
Netscape has a "strange" behavior. 
   If you don't have a .mailcap file he asks you where you want to save the 
	document --> I don't like it, but it's only the default behavior.
   If you do have a .mailcap file whith:
	application/x-compress:  /usr/local/bin/gunzip %s
        application/x-dvi:       /usr/local/bin/xdvi %s
   Netscape tries to apply "/usr/local/bin/xdvi %s" to the xxx.dvi.gz file, instead
   of applying gunzip and then xdvi. 
 
Has anyone solved this problem ?


Thanks in advance for all time and trouble. Best regards,

	Jose Miranda

Hello,

Using Mosaic 2.1 on Sun5.3, when I take a postscript file compressed with the 
compress command ( namefile.ps.Z), the document is uncompressed in flight.

When I use Mosaic NetScape, I haven't this uncompression in flight and my
postscript viewer (ghostview) doesn't understand the language of this file.

What I have to do to have with Mosaic NetScape the uncompression in flight ?

Thank you very much in advance for your help

                HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol BOF 
                        Wednesday December 7th 1994                     
                                19:30-22:00     

HTTP - the HyperText Transfer Protocol is an applications protocol
which serves as the basis of the World Wide Web distributed hypertext
system.  The BOF has two main aims. The first goal is to review and correct
the updated HTTP 1.0 specification to make it suitable for standards track
advancement. The second aim is to discuss future work on the next versions of
HTTP, and to formally propose the setting up on a working group for HTTP.

Please send comments on the agenda to Dave Raggett <dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com>

It appear that many folks have been having a problem with this.
And the winner is:
>From: Jonny Goldman <jonny@Synopsys.COM>
*****************************************************************************
I had similar problems when trying to use my HTTP/WAIS gateway (fwais.pl)
under other SYSV based UNIX's.

There were two problems, one in search and the other in retrieval.  Both
were related to the fact that vsprintf in SYSV dies when it attempts to
print a "%s" that is NULL.

The solutions were:

1.  Set some environment variables in the script:

if (! $ENV{'USER'}) { $ENV{'USER'} = "nobody";}
if (! $ENV{'HOME'}) { $ENV{'HOME'} = "/";}

2.  Set a dummy "document name" when attempting to retrieve:

	print TMP "     :headline \"foo\" :number-of-bytes -1 :type \"$type\"\n";

I don't know if the second problem exists in wais.pl.  No doubt the first
does.
*****************************************************************************
The first worked...

Is anyone speaking up for the addition of (and definition of) the  
"multipart/form-data" MIME type to the list of content-types  
registered for use with HTTP?  I don't see any mention of this in the  
available documents, but it's part of Larry Masinter and Ernesto  
Nebel's important proposal for file upload in FORMs.

Subject: HTML Mode for Emacs 19
content-length: 657

I have modified html-mode.el to work under Gnu Emacs 19.
(The last version I saw worked under Lucid Emacs 19 but not
Gnu.)  For those who have not seen html-mode.el, the main
contribution is to provide a set of commands to insert
the most common tags.  It is not a Web browser or HTML
previewer.   The Emacs 19 versions also provide a menubar
so you don't need to remember the command sequences, some
of which are rather obscure to say the least.  There is
also a small amount of font hackery so that bold face
and emphasis are displayed as such.

Feel free to copy it from ftp://dri.cornell.edu/pub/davis/html-mode.el

Please send improvements back to me.

The solution to this problem depends on the size of the database.
Whilst for small database, generating a fixed set of html pages may be
feasable, it rapidly becomes too complex to maintain. Your sources
are right in thinking that the easiest way is to generate HTML on the fly.
If you are working on a UNIX machine, and your database is smaller than, say,
20,000 records, you don't need any database software - the UNIX standard
utilites cover this ( two nice little programs called grep and awk ). For
slightly larger databases - 20,000 - 60,000 records, the public domain
programming language PERL is quite good. Above this size you tend to need 
a more comprehensive and professional package. 

Any professional database which supports generic report designs is capable
of generating HTML on the fly. ( For Example, Oracle, Ingress, Postgress etc )

Our programs are written using UNIX shell, and call ispell in addition to 
various standard UNIX utilities. They search a 20,000 record database of 
information relating to images stored in separate files. This is perfectly
adequate for our needs, and does not require any complex software. In addition
it is much easier to maintain and modify, than something like 'C'.

This could be covered in the discussion period following the review
of the Internet draft for HTTP 1.0. My plan is for us to identify goals
for one or more subgroups to look at missing features in HTTP 1.0.

The subgroups would recommend suitable extensions to HTTP 1.0, or work
with the subgroup drafting the HTTP-NG spec to make sure that the identified
needs are being covered.

I will send out a revised agenda that makes this clear.

The last I knew, most commercial document management systems were licensed 
on a "per-potential user" basis -- you buy as many licenses as there are 
people at your site that might sometime use their software.  Could anyone 
from one of these companies comment on whether use of a gateway would 
constitute one user (i.e. the HTTP server) or multiple users (each person 
that accesses a Web document controlled by the document management 
software)?

Subject: A few semantic points for HTTP/1.0 draft
Cc: www-talk@www0.cern.ch
content-length: 4862

After a quick read through the HTTP/1.0 draft, I have a couple of comments.
By and large, the draft seems to be a very good representation of standard
practice (with a nod to concerns over multi-part messages), but there are
two "pet peeves" that remain unresolved and could be cleared up with a
short addition of some semantic info to the spec.

Specifically, there are minor ambiguities regarding the 503 error code
defined in section 6.3.4 and the encoding of object-body parts as described
in section 7 and RFC 1630.

Regarding section 6.3.4, the draft specifies that the error code "503
Service Unavailable" simply indicates that the server is unable to handle
the request. There are two different occasions when this code can be
returned, both of which are detailed in this paragraph. Unfortunately, one
is a short-term, transient condition (busy) that the client may reasonably
expect to disappear momentarily. The other, a server is administratively
off-line, is a condition of indeterminent duration and the client cannot
infer how long this condition will last.

Current client support for 503 is minimal. As an example, NetScape's
response to a 503 error is to begin repeatedly resending the client's
request until it is satisfied or the client times out. If the server is
moderately busy, the client may be quickly serviced without impacting
performance from the user's or server's perspective. If the server is
heavily overloaded, a rapid, repeated resubmission of the request will only
make the problem worse.

In the case that the server is administratively off line, and 503 is being
returned to indicate that the server is alive but unable to process
connections, client behavior as above is clearly unacceptable. Obviously,
some guidance in implementing client responses to this error code is
needed. Optimally, information should be returned to a client to help
determine an appropriate client response to a 503 error.

As a solution, I'd like to propose an additional response-header for the
503 error response that specifies a time at which the client may expect the
server to be able to handle requests again. This time should be relative to
the Date: header sent by the client. I propose that this time be specified
as a delta from this date in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds until
availability. The client should not attempt to resend its request before
this delta period of time has elapsed.

For the case of a busy server, this could be a delta of a few seconds from
the present (or a delta value calculated on the load of the server, depth
of the request queue, etc.) For an "off-line" server, this could be a delta
supplied by administration (i.e. the server will be back up in 30 minutes)
or an arbitrarily longer value (10 seconds, a few minutes) that would
prevent rapid client retries.

A candidate syntax for this response header field returned by the server is:

Retry-After    = "Retry-After" ":" *LWSP-char 3DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT

The 3 numeric fields represent the number of hours, minutes, and seconds to
wait before attempting to contact the server again after the server has
reported a 503 error. The server should also return its own Date: field as
part of the response in all cases.



With regard to comment number 2, the encoding of object-body parts, there
is a non-trivial ambiguity in RFC 1630 regarding the encoding of spaces as
"+", and where this is allowed. For WWW clients that encode object-bodies
using the URL-encoding scheme, behavior is inconsistent. Some clients
encode specials in the object-body text using %xx hex encodings
exclusively. Others use %xx encodings for all specials except space, and
encode spaces as "+".

According to 1630, "+" may be used as a shorthand for space in the search
portion of a URI. Unfortunately, the BNF for URIs is ambiguous in that the
definition of the non-terminal "xpalphas" includes separating "xalphas"
with "+", implying that spaces can be encoded as "+" anywhere.

In my opinion, the object-body of a HTTP request is not the search portion
of a URI. Therefore, spaces should only be encoded using %xx encodings and
not "+" encodings. This ambiguity has never been resolved and a definitive
statement regarding appropriate encoding of object-bodies using
URL-encoding in this draft of the HTTP standard would be helpful. It may be
a moot point, since many clients encode POST arguments using both
techniques, and many gateway apps parse pluses as space. Nonetheless, an
appropriate "ruling" should be made in the HTTP standard.

Thanks for your consideration,
Chuck Shotton

This is unacceptable, if a server is busy then that information should be
returned to the user. Sending 503 should in the main be done only at the point
where the server is about to collapse.

One solution to this is to use a threaded server and implement a lockout,
once a client recieves 503 the site is blacklisted for a period. Retry attempts
in this interval would increase the blacklist period and/or return notification 
of a protocol violation.

I like the idea of a retry in x seconds field, it would allow a server to 
schedule a slot where the request was guaranteed to be handled. I would like
to have some control over the interpretation though. How about:-

Deadtime: time[; reason=tag][; retry=policy]

Where time is the deadtime in seconds, a time of 0 being an indeterminate
length of time. 

reason tags could include:

busy 
maintenance 

retry policies would include:

blacklist	retry attempts are now blacklisted
ignore		retry attempts are simply ignored
lockout		retry attempts are dealt with by router lockout.


The final one is something added to one implementation to deal with denial
of service attacks. If more than a certain number of accesses are made the
system goes into `lockout mode'. This involves adding a filter record to the
router to redirect packets to another server (amongst other things).


We should also have a facility to allow an alternative site to be stated.
This would permit rather more gracefull fallover and provide some load 
balancing.

Subject: Motion on 503 Error Code
content-length: 733

I second the motion that 503 needs to distinguish between loaded and
unavailable.
503 has been used for loaded servers so it might be better to differentiate down
for maintenance by adding another error code.

That way, the loaded server need not cons headers.

503 is not being used for kicks and the Netascape behavior is entirely
antisocial.

What the netscape behavior will achieve is to make loaded server unable to
respond
to other clients.

Simple solution: just don't  bother to answer the netscape clients when
running loaded.

We're not precisely a doc management system, but what we sell is quite
similar.  We use multiple pricing models.  Sometimes it's per-seat,
sometimes it's per concurrent user.

However, the nature of the Web makes those models hard to apply, so we're
going to drop them for our server.  We're using a one-time price (plus
maintenance) that will allow unlimited use on one CPU.  And we'll also sell
one or more browsers that we'll OEM, which ends up being rather similar to
selling per-seat, but without the kind of ambiguities that you've
described.

I suspect that everyone in this business is going to have to evolve similar
models or be left behind.

Hi,

I have a relativly large application started as CGI script from
cern httpd 3.0x. My question is : If the client drops the connection
*and* the server notice that before the script was finished , sends
the server a signal (and which) to the cgi process or not? How can
I ensure that a script is not terminated by the server in a critical
section and leave a database corrupt?(okay, i could catch the signals,
but is there another way?)

thanks in advance

The only time that httpd kills the script is if it times out
(ScriptTimeOut directive if I recall).  It then first sends TERM,
waits 5 seconds, and then sends KILL.

If the client has disconnected from the server, then the server will
catch SIGPIPE when it's doing the next write to the socket, and exit.
It doesn't send a signal to the script then, but leaves the script
running (maybe this could be thought of as a bug, too).

If you want to be sure that your CGI script is unaffected by kills, do
an extra fork to obtain a new pid so the server can't send it TERM and
KILL.

Perhaps 503 should not be viewed as such a catastrophic event. In the case of
planned maintenance it is a convenient way to announce the interruption
in service. If 503 were not viable solution, you'd see many ad hoc solutions
like presenting the same "OutOfService.html" page regardless of the client
request.

In the case of the overloaded server 503 error, there is not enough information 
provided currently about when the load will be reasonable or how the client
could access equivalent information elsewhere.

This is beginning to get overly complicated for the simple case of managing 
the load on an over loaded server. I see my dentist every six months. Third Thursday
of the month at 4:00 PM. If I'm lucky I get a postcard in the mail as a reminder.
If I reschedule at the last minute, I get whatever slot is available at that time.

If the 503 error could schedule a reasonable "appointment" for completing the 
transaction a simple list of host/time pairs could be maintained by the server.
Assuming all clients call back at their appointed times the load can be fairly 
dispersed by the server. If client calls back before their scheduled appointment,
they will receive another 503 error with their scheduled time slot (or if penalties
need to be enforced move them to the end of the appointment list).

If a server scheduled appointments at one minute intervals a flood of 600
clients could be spaced out over the next ten hours (potentially prioritized 
by site, client timezone, etc.). This prevents individual clients from hogging
available bandwidth and allows new clients to potentially be serviced in the slots
where blocked clients missed their appointed callback.

			WN -- a server for the HTTP
			Version 0.93 (beta) now available

	An HTTP server should do more than just serve files.
	It should play an active role in both navigation and
	presentation issues.  It is my hope that this server
	provides better tools for the creative webmaster.

WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  It runs
on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and is available at no cost for
any use under the terms of the GNU public license.

The design of WN is based on the use of a small flat database in each
directory with information about the files in that directory.
Fields associated with a file include its title, and may include
keywords, expiration date and any user defined fields like author or
document id.

User's Guide at
	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/manual.html

or just an overview at
	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/overview.html

To see a few of the things this server can do that most others can't
check out the index to the User's Guide at

	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/docindex.html

Features:
	o A variety of built-in searches including title searches,
	  keyword searches, or fielded searches for user defined fields.
	  These can be done across the entire server or any subhierarchy.

	o Builtin full text searching of text documents in a single 
	  directory.  This is intended to provide a mechanism for users
	  to search a single logical HTML document which may consist of
	  many files on the server.

	o Secure server side includes and wrappers for documents.

	o Security based on per directory databases.  Only files with entries
	  in databases may be served.

	o Filters.  An arbitrary filter may be assigned to any document
	  to process that document on the fly when serving it.

	o CGI 1.1 support for forms, clickable images etc.  CGI scripts
	  can be in any directory.  Their execution can be restricted
	  by requiring a specific user or group id for the database 
	  referring to them.

	o Ranges. Support for URLs which return only a specified byte
	  or line range of a document.  This is useful for structured
	  files.

	o Over 100K of documentation.

WN's functionality was planned with a focus on serving HTML documents.
This means such things as enabling full text searching of a single
logical HTML document which may consist of many files on the server,
or allowing users users to search all titles on the server and obtain
a menu of matching items, or allowing users to download a total
logical document for printing even though the document consists of
many linked files on the server.  All of these are done in a way which
is transparent to the user (and largely transparent to the maintainer!)
The User's Guide at <http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/doc/manual.html">
provides a good example of both of these. But these are only examples of 
many new tools WN makes available to webmasters.

Subject: Comments in media

	A week or so ago, David Koblas (koblas@netcom.com)
tossed out a remark in:

	http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-talk-1994q4/0790.html

	...that TIFF and GIF images could retain copyright
information via comments, and it's interesting that nobody
has explored this before! I've seen other people's copyrighted
images spread around the Web like wildfire, and there is often
very little the orginal author can do about it, unless they're
willing to spend a lot of time tracking down webmasters.
	I call this kind of thing an "image virus" - sometimes
the first person who copies a piece is ignorant of copyright law;
once an image is viewed on a certain number of sites, people
begin to assume it's in the public domain and it gets copied even
more. For instance, you may be familiar with the "little red shaded
bullet ball" virus - or the more recent "tiny new! balloon" virus...
then there's a whole strain of horizontal rule images... :)
	One can't stop this thing completely, of course, but
I'd like to propose some things which may help:

        * Make it easy for authors to create and change comments.

          A little program that reads and writes comments to images
          would be great, for instance:

	  comment house.gif *.jpg *.tiff *xbm -r

	  ...could read any comments that exist, while:

	  comment *.gif -w "This image is Copyright 1994 John Doe.\n
          Created in Somewhere, CA by johnd@somewhere.com.\n
          Used with permission."

	  ...would write in the comment easily. It would be nice if
          xv, xpaint, and the like could do this easily as well. Of
          course, bad guys could change the comment easily too, but
          at least they have to consciously do something after copying
          an image.

        * Make it easy for users to view comments.

          What do you think of the idea of being able to view image
          comments in Web browsers, so when you (right-mouse click,
          option-click, shift-click, move the mouse, menu option,
          whatever) on an inline image, the comments appear (in a
          message area, a dialog box, a pop-up area, below the image,
          etc.)?

	This can make it easy for webmasters to determine the origins of
images and the limitations associated with them, and can make it easy for
administrators to contact the author for permission to use a work. It can
also make it easy to index media by keywords, create contact sheets with
descriptions, etc., etc.. And Web users would know exactly what's going on.
	On that note, does anyone know if the QuickTime and MPEG formats
support comments? Sun audio?
	If somebody made this tool/patch/feature I know there are many
online artists out there who would be grateful! I would do this, but
image format and browser hacking is currently out of my area of expertise.
	Any takers? Comments?

I was told that 503 meant server busy and that the client should continue
to retry after a slight delay until it could get through.  Maybe I was
mis-informed?  For now I will remove the retry behavior so that Netscape
fails gracefully when a 503 is encountered and not retry again.  Whenever
someone finally figures out what to do in the 503 case I'll reimplement
the new solution.

Since Kevin has given me such an easy lead in...
 
I'm just beta testing now a tool that does much of what Kevin is looking
for for GIF images.  You can preview, provied you give me feedback, the
tool I'm finishing off.  It is short documentation but '-help' should
tell you everything you will need to know.
 
        http://www.homepages.com/tools/giftool.tar.Z
 
This tool does a variety of things, add/remove comments and interlace
GIF images.   Specifically it will batch convert large sets of images
for you so for those of you who want to redo you whole site with them
(it preseverses transparency).  You should type (please make a backup
first!):
 
        find RootDirectory -name \*.gif -print | xargs giftool -B -i
 
You can also add comments in such a way:
        giftool -B \
                +c "Copyright 1994, XYZZY  Redistribution prohibited." *.gif
 
giftool also supports all of the transparency options that transgif
does, so you only need one tool to do everything you probably need to
do to GIF images.

--
 
I know that MPEG audio has a copyright, and copy policy blocks.  So
that you can say that this stream cannot be copied...  I cannot belive
that QuickTime is missing such a beast as copyright tags.
 
If there is enough interest, I will pop out the approprate JPEG tool,
but there needs to be sufficent interest.

It was I that "created" the 503 code last summer. My intention, and the
thrust of the discussion on www-talk, was exactly that... The server is
temporarily too busy, try again in a "short while". I envisioned the
"short while" to be a few seconds, not milliseconds, not minutes. So
your response was appropriate.

However, Phillip's observations and ideas make sense to me, and I have 
already posted my support for most of them. I too will sit this one out
for the time being and implement any additional 5nn codes for things
like "maintenance", or generate the "please try back in x time" response
headers, or whatever... as long as there is reasonable consensus amongst
the key implementers. I see Rob is monitoring things here as well. Good.

I did my research and there is the following tools already available:
	rdjpgcom -- read jpeg comments
	wrjpgcom -- write jpeg comments
The are part of the JPEG v5 library distribution.  Which is available
on many fine servers including:
	ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v5.tar.Z

First, let me say that I live in Japan, and have done for over 8 years
now. I think I know the industry here reasonably well.

Most people here who have something against Unicode are either pushing
their own standards, or have some *political* reason for not agreeing.
One can waffle about the fact that the Kanji Unification leads to
cases where the character displayed is not what one would expect, but
that is an *application* and *display* problem, not a codeset problem.

Due to the line of work I'm in, I have to talk to many people here who
are in the publishing, printing, and computer industries. When I ask
them how we will deal with large scale international  document
exchange (and acutally, this is relevant to OMG too), they always
start by saying "well, let's have the browsers understand EUC, and
SJIS". I then point out that there are *dozens* of local character
encoding systems, and there are more being invented every day. I ask
them if it is reasonable to expect every browser to be able to handle
a potentially huge number of encoding systems. I think not.

Rather, what I think is a more reasonable way, is to use UTF-8 or
UTF-7 for charcater encoding while the document is *in the process of
being transferred*. It is then converted to a local encoding by the
browser. With such a system we might end up with many cases like:

  Windows     "The Ether where electrons flow"   Unix
   SJIS----------------->UTF-8--------------------EUC

And this *vastly* simplifies the problem. Instead of having to
potentially understand hundreds of encoding, and being able to convert
them all into the local encoding (and UTF would be one of them), one
now only has to understand *two* encoding, and be able to convert
between them.

Many people will now be saying "yes. but what about the cases where
you *can't* display the document, and the case where the Kanji
Unification rears it's head". Well, in the first case, one can offer
to save the document in it's UTF form, which would be the same even if
UTF-8 wasn't being used (except you'd have to save it in some other
format). In addition, I think that as computational linguistics
improve, it will be possible to convert the text into a local encoding
of the phonetic representation of the text (for example, the Kanji
"hara" would be converted from the Unicode encoding to the word "hara"
on ASCII-Only systems). This will probably happen *after* most systems
become internationalised enough to handle the most common cases :-(.
For the Unification problem, I think it should be possible to mark up
the UTF-8 document such that the display characteristics will be
preserved as part of the translation from the local encoding to the
UTF-8 encoding. For example, is one sends a Kanji, one could mark the
document language as "Japanese" or "Chinese", or even do it with some
kind of inline escape sequence (using the area reserved for
extensions). 

When I discuss these ideas with people here, they are very receptive.
Many people say that more conservative, and governmental thinkers are
very stubborn, so things will not change quickly. I think that by
implementing such systems *now*, we can force them to accept what I
think is a very practical solution to handling the myriad character
encoding schemes extant in the world.

I should note that the stylesheet format which is being defined by
SGML-Open *will* be able to handle international display
characteristics like bidirectional text, though it will be an optional
feature in the lowest functionality version. The upgrade path will be
seemless, or close to it.

Just to raise an issue/thought.  We spend a lot of time worring about
"access control" as it relates to Visa (payment) and content 
sensitivity (do you have to be authorized to see this).

We are neglecting on form of access control that I think might be
just as important "parental control".  Something similar to what
is seen on records, videos and games.  How many "families" are 
going to want to let their "young and easily influenced" children
loose on the web?

If the client<->server interaciton provides the ability for preferential
content hiding, it will make things much more acceptable to a wider
audiance.

Maybe something like:
 <CLIENT>
	Content-Guidance: {*,violence,sex,...}={specifer}
 <SERVER>
	Content-Guidance: sex=MPAA-R (i.e no male nudity, only simulated sex)

Trivially there are probably three guidlines that people would want
to self-censor information on sex, violence, and religon.  I can't quite
see censoring Dow Jones reports about Sun Microsystems as something
many people would like to do....would they?

This might allow a 10 year old to visit www.playboy.com but not see
anything that they "shouldn't" see, and the rest of us not 
inconvenienced by more passwords and access methods.

Food for though,

I would prefer to see a dedicated field for copyright. Also, I would
like to see provision for a PGP authenticated image format. One problem
with digital images is that they are too easy to modify, and the orignal
owner of the copyright may not want to be associated with the modified 
image. PGP authentication allows the author to determine and prove that
the image has been modified.

Check out netpbm. It is an image processing library with lots of

Ummm. I'd generalise it to image information, and use field tagging in
a data block to allow other field entries to be displayed. This would be
useful for our images, as we could download the associated database record
( in human readable format ) along with the image.

	These sort of features would be nice too, but I'm trying to
focus on things that are simple to use and implement and can be done now.
That allows one to think about tools for the next generation...

	It doesn't, but David's excellent tool will do most of what people
will need. It's rare to find a program that does interlacing while
preserving transparency in a batch job. The netpbm programs are not so
great for doing this.

	My point is that it should be easy for Web users to easily glean
copyright information in browsers. It points out the bad eggs quickly.

	My apologies if I confused people by putting too much emphasis
on the utility and philosophy and not the browser interface. Where is
an appropriate forum to discuss general browser issues so that developers
can hear them and offer their comments? (This list seemed to work great the
last time I did that... :)
	Seriously, have things evolved to the point in which another
list would be appropriate?

The bug was that you did not get it into the spec and so you have caused
considerable
confusion when cern allocated a different number for the meltdown case.

The meltdown case is needed in two very high volume cases of important
fielded servers.

I have changed the error code returned from 502 issued by CERN early this
fall to
your PC 503.  Let us not have another big round of confusion here again.

The only way we're going to avoid further confusion is with different error
codes.

So, let us stick with 503 to mean melting down don't try back soon unless I
give you
a time.

Let us add a new error code 504 (?) for use with all administrative cases,
e.g. down for maintanance
back whenever.....

Since a server that is melting down has no cycles to spare,  it needs to do
minimum work to
issue the error code.  For this reason, all the nice administrative frills
need to be added to
a separate error code.

We should get a decision on this and get it into the 2.0 http spec so that
2.0 compliant servers
and clients do reasonable things in these denial of service cases.

    >right solution for Japanese. . .
    
    First, let me say that I live in Japan, and have done for over 8 years
    now. I think I know the industry here reasonably well.
    
    Most people here who have something against Unicode are either pushing
    their own standards, or have some *political* reason for not agreeing...

Yes, I've heard these arguments too. An additional one is
that characters as currently encoded in Japanese-specific
code sets are in an order such that the characters can be
collated using their encoded values. This is the same as
ASCII often is collated. In Unicode, however, the characters
are no longer "in order", so collation based on encoded values
doesn't work.

Every code set has pros and cons. 
    
    . . . they always
    start by saying "well, let's have the browsers understand EUC, and
    SJIS". I then point out that there are *dozens* of local character
    encoding systems, and there are more being invented every day. I ask
    them if it is reasonable to expect every browser to be able to handle
    a potentially huge number of encoding systems. I think not.

There are many local encoding systems, but in the past few
years I've seen a good bit of progress toward consolidation.
There is a national profile for Japanese that specifies
very carefully and completely a standard EUC encoding, and
those who produce EUC-based systems are moving toward this.
There still is a lot of variability in Shift-JIS implementations.
I agree that it clearly is not reasonable for every browser to
handle a multitude of varying encoding implementations.
    
    Rather, what I think is a more reasonable way, is to use UTF-8 or
    UTF-7 for charcater encoding while the document is *in the process of
    being transferred*. It is then converted to a local encoding by the
    browser. With such a system we might end up with many cases like:
    
      Windows     "The Ether where electrons flow"   Unix
       SJIS----------------->UTF-8--------------------EUC
    
    And this *vastly* simplifies the problem. Instead of having to
    potentially understand hundreds of encoding, and being able to convert
    them all into the local encoding (and UTF would be one of them), one
    now only has to understand *two* encoding, and be able to convert
    between them.

Interestingly, this is part of what we implemented in OSF's
DCE (Distributed Computing Environment). We actually use
Unicode (ISO 10646) as a transfer form rather than UTF-8. However,
the major difference between your suggestion and our implementation
is that we require support for Unicode as a transfer encoding
but do *not* require that all transfers be done in Unicode. If
the source and target are both using, say, the same version
of SJIS, we allow data to be sent without conversion. If the
source and target are different but there is a direct conversion
module between them (say, SJIS to EUC), we allow the data to be
converted from the source to the target.

If the source and target are different *and* there is no direct
conversion module, we require that there be source-to-Unicode
and Unicode-to-target conversion modules. This is the same as
your example above.

The benefit of this model is that it avoids unnecessary
conversions. However, by requiring support for conversions
into and out of Unicode/10646, we avoid trying to support
an infinite number of encoding variations.

There is a revised draft of the file-upload proposal, submitted to the
internet drafts editor, available as

<URL:ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/transient/file-upload/
draft-ietf-html-fileupload-01.txt>

As this was just submitted to the internet drafts editor, it might not
be available in the standard internet-drafts locations for a while.
(Please note that this URL will expire in two weeks; I'll try to find
a more permanent home for the files).

In addition to numerous wording changes, the substantive changes since
the last internet draft are:

  * Propose ACCEPT attribute on <INPUT> types.
  * change "multipart/www-form-data" to just "multipart/form-data"
  * use "content-disposition" in "multipart" responses to identify
    original file names (as per MIME spec)

Rob Potter of XSoft has created a prototype implementation of this
proposal. These are also in

	<URL:ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/transient/file-upload>

and consist of diffs or revised versions of files from the Mosaic 2.4

Sigh, I think it's the parents we need to restrict (from being butt-heads).
This kind of censorships does more harm to children than good (how
you think they feel when they find out they have been lied too).

Never mind that it is trivial to write something that sends an HTTP
request and saves the data in a file (I have a 50 line perl script
that will do it, took all of about 15 minutes to write).

Of course, I can think of much better uses for this than censorship but
yes, I would like to see something like this make it into wide-spread use
(digital signatures that is).  You could have CERT certified software
distributions, etc.

If it wasn't for the bogusly wide patent on the RSA stuff we would
likely already have this.

Seems like these schemes would only be workable if an "unrated" page was 
assumed to be unacceptable and was "blocked" (which it sounds like Brian 
intended).  I wouldn't expect the playboy people, for instance, to 
willingly rate their pages unless pressured/forced to do so.  (Perhaps 
that's a bad example, since a corporation is associated with that site.  
I wouldn't expect some individual maintaining a pornographic/erotic web 
site to use MPAA ratings, and pressuring an individual to do so would be 
much more difficult.)

Another solution might be to have a centralized "rating server" (or 
several) which a browser might consult before retrieving any page.  In 
this model an author would not have to agree to be rated.  Such a 
browser, however, would require two connections for each retrieval, one 
to the rating server and one to the origin server.

It's hard to express how abhorrent I find the rating server idea; and I 
don't think the other schemes are much better.  I agree that it could be 
accomplished.  However, if a browser either rejected all unrated pages or 
consulted some central morals committee before retrieving any page, the

don't know that any such solution would be "elegant."

Well, the point is that the ratings server is advisory, and you
could have several points of view (ie: the Libertarians rate pages
on a political scale as would the Republicans on their SOAP server, etc)

Now, if I were letting a school browse around, I would find such a 
service useful (some sort of school-board or teacher made rating server)
since I effectivly delegate responsibility to the SOAP server.

If I wanted to ignore the SOAP server I could do that by using an
'unenhanced' browser, or turning off a SOAP preference. 

I could even use such a service to search: i.e. show a list of all
the URLs rated XXX by the 'horny-geeks' SOAP server.

I would expect that Playboy would adopt a "guide" system, since if it is
easy and _free_ for them to do it and prevents unecessary legal action,
it pays off.

        * There was a recent case in which a BBS system in Californa
          distributed pornography to somebody in Lousiana (?). That
          person took the BBS systems owners to court and won their
          lawsuit regarding trafficing in indecent material.

Technically the playboy server is doing this today and they are an
easy (big) target.  It is very difficult to target
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica when half of the posting orgiate in Finalnd.

Having a centralized rating server is a problem.  Since it requires
somebody to maintain it (read: money has to change hands).  Setting
up such a server is interesting, but then there are issues about
browsing it, availability, etc...

I think that if any system is truely defined, it should include the
ability to check a "key" against a server.  Thus when your client
receives a KEY it can query the MPAA server to see if it is valid.

I don't classify this as "prohibiting the flow of information", but rather
as providing a mechanism to classify.  When city hall and the library
install public access terminals to show they are taking part in the
"Information Superhighway" the last thing that they want is "dirty pictures"
up on their screens, it makes for bad press.

I think it should be possible to both _self_rate_ pages and have hooks
for _official_ratings_.  We don't want to make it difficult for people
to read you resume (sorry, but it's unrated thus must be "hard core").
At the same time we need to think about making it possible to say
that this content has certain "properties" that some people find find
offensive (be it imagry, language, or content).

Most of these issues are not issues for most of us (or even me), but
I personally would enjoy figuring out how there could be Internet
access in every school.  Lets figure out how to make this happen before
some organization figures out how to become a big brother organization
and reads/censors information before it is delivered to people.

Yes, you're right; there certainly are groups (such as schools) that could
make use of such servers.  My strong reaction against the idea was in
agreement with Brian's statement, that information should flow as freely as
possible [a paraphrase; apologies if I've given this a different spin].   A
browser that would reject all unrated pages is antithetical to this; and
your vision of a SOAP opera [sorry] seems the antithesis of the web's links
-- instead of joining information resources, they would fragment resources
into enclaves around particular SOAPs.

Speaking about it in a more general way these ratings
are no different from other file meta information which,
at present, we have no good way of making available.

This starts to lead into talk about URNs and friends
which I don't care to go in to but I just thought I'd
point out that it doesn't seem reasonable to have a special
purpose mechanism for ratings info since there'll be,
at some point, a general mechanism for meta info.

Particularly if that individual is in a community where the norms

*World* wide web...

That's likely to be the main problem with such ratings; there is not
necessarily any system of *restrictions* to go along with the ratings.
An NC-17 rating will prevent some theaters from showing a movie, will
prevent some patrons from getting in, will prevent large video stores
from carrying the film, etc.  But, on the Internet, nobody knows
you're a voyeur.

I'm sure people can come up with money for it.  Just take some
existing agency, the Coalition for Family Values and Mom's Apple Pie,
and have them use some catchy slogan ("Taking the obscene billboards
off the Information Highway") to get money from their faithful flock
concerned about moral decay.

Mind you, given the amount of material available on the net, and the
rate at which it is growing or changing, evaluating a meaningful
portion of the net is probably not possible.  Instead, they'll
probably have to concentrate more on finding objectionable items and
label them as "bad."  What a job.  Meanwhile, people will be hamming
it up, putting up pictures of Bambi and getting it rated "G" and
immediately replacing it with something, er, different.  (The security
could avoid this, but re-rating every item on the net every time it
changes is impossible.)

Obwww-talk content:  This is, of course, just a special case of the
general need to allow people to specify additional information about
pages as annotations and the like.  Notes like "I think this page is
stupid" or "The facts stated here are incorrect" or "There are naked
people here" are useful information to have, but we seem little closer
to having them today than we did when the NCSA annotation server first
went online.

Should I actually be able to forbid explicit reference (by UR*)
to my published work by SOAPs?  The existence of filters of this
sort, which can be invoked automatically, offers a line of attack
on free speech that it is difficult to duplicate in the print
world---it's one of the few genuinely new things in life beyond
print.

Just asking.

In addition to being abhorrent to most of us for all sorts of
reasons related to censorship, if there weren't some centralized
"power" and "control" involved, it wouldn't have a prayer....and not
much of one even then.  Just like students always find ways to hack
systems (and not just computer systems), I can guarantee you that
some students would click up pix of mickey and minnie mouse from the
G server at disney.com and get a picture of three men, four women and
a pony doing all sorts of unnatural things.   If ratings weren't
centrally controlled, you could also be sure that lots of 'porn
servers' would rate themselves G just for the hell of it.

One more reason that centralized control is less likely to happen
is the current slander/libel case against prodigy.com.  Apparently
their reputation and practice for actively censoring postings on
their service make them MUCH more liable for the postings on the
system than others that make a "common carrier" defense with great
success.

As my daughter would say: "Bull Honkey"

I suggest you get your facts straight before launching an attack like that.
The 503 code was discussed at length on this list, and the discussion
included, among others, Ari Luotonen (then at CERN working on the code),
Henrik Frystyk, Roy Fielding, and Rob McCool. I placed the proposal into
discussion, asked for comments, received some, but got no objections. 
If you care, read the archives. Just in case you're too busy to read the
archives (obviously you didn't _before_ making the above statement), here
is an excerpt from a note from Henrik, along with the header, for complete-
ness: Henrik, my apologies in advance for using your note...

Note that Henrik proposed 502 as "bad response" at that time, and my proposal
was for 503. Now, what "spec" do you mean? The "working draft" at CERN? At
the time, TimBL was a new father, Ari was headed for Finland, thence to 
Calif to work at "Mosaic", Henrik was getting into the swing of things,
Rob McCool was finishing school and thinking all about his opportunities 
at "Mosaic" versus how he was going to finish school... I did what I thought
was approprite, I asked Ari to at least _try_ to get the change in, but in
fairness to him, he was really preoccupied and never told me he would.

So there it is.

No - the intent with a SOAP (like a <LINK>) is purely advisory.
Whether or not the advice is heeded is up to a combination of the
browser and the user.  

i.e. You will always be able to use Arena and browse the unfiltered web.
(Hey! new slogan: "ARENA: The Unfiltered Web Frontier")  If you choose to
use the K12-WebBrowser (or let your kids use it), then that is up to you.
It's like bookstores - it's not seen as censorship, but many people choose
not to patronize adult bookstores and also prevent their kids from walking
around the red-light district.

Note that you might also choose not to censor the page but just log the
fact that it occurred.  (Cue: "What are those URLs under the bed?"
discussion).

ObWWW: for Meta information - if we want meta information to implement
SOAPs, then the architecture must allow meta information to be 
distributed -i.e. I may have SOAPs about your documents, and browsers
which are aware of the fact need to integrate the two sources before
presenting the result.

Well said.  As long as the Web community does not allow governmental bodies 
(or groups in league with governmental bodies) to mandate the use of 
browsers that force their SOAP advice on users, the information on the Web 
will remain unfettered.  Don't laugh too hard about the possibility of 
government mandates -- the U.S. political correctness movement would 
undoubtably love a government mandate forcing people to use browsers that 
permit only politically correct material to be viewed.  (This applies to the 
political correctness of both the left (environmentalism, feminism, ...) and 
the right (America as a Christian nation, fornication, ....).)

On the third hand (as a Motie would say :)), if the Web software gets so 
complex that it cannot be written except by large corporations, a danger 
(hopefully remote) exists of the corporation(s) installing mandatory SOAP 
advice use to forestall legal problems ("my 12-year old daughter looked at 
http://www.playboy.com and is mentally scarred for life!").

Remember, it's a WORLD wide web.  Norway has different standards of
prurience than the U.S, and so on...

Unlike the ISO (purveyor of the widely used X.400, X.500 and ISO/OSI models)
the IETF (AFAIK - feel free to shoot this down) has yet to come up with
an utterly unimplementable standard.  In this regard, the net is quite
fortunate - methinks the prototype requirement has something to do with it.

Unless we define some method of negotiating character set encoding for
WWW, I think that the solution you outline above could not be
implemented, though given encoding negotiation, it obviously *is* of
great practical value.

Interestly enough, I spoke to 2 technical documentation
writer/translators who were vehemently against Unicode because it does
not support every possible character in the world... they noted that
there are more than 100,000 Kanji, most of which are not used except
in scholarly works.... and they are correct. It does not have codes
for some of the various Indian languages.

Still, as a lowest common denominator, I think it will handle most
(90%) situations, and I think *that* by itself, is a big step forward.

It is an interesting (and frightening) exercise to think how the Web would 
have evolved if the governments of Singapore, Ireland, or North Korea had 
initiated the Web.  Or the U.S. government, for that matter...

There are subcultures in every government in the world (IMHO) that would 
like some kind of mandated forbidden Web access to certain non-classified 
materials.  The content of the materials would be different for different 
regimes -- but the underlying mindset is the same.

Since upgrading to Netscape 0.93b from 0.9b, I've been getting a lot of

Any clue as to what's causing this? and what I can do to fix it?

This is the bane of *any* ratings scheme.  Those that have something
to lose by being rated, circumvent a cooperative rating system agreement.
While those that have nothing to lose by participating, gladly cooperate.
That's why industries that (for whatever reason) generate opposition
groups tend to avoid such a scheme until fear of government or economic
retribution is credible enough to make bedfellows of the likely winners
and losers. (read video gamers).

Electronic information just destroys the chance for a good old fashioned
book burning doesn't?   ;-)  What I really mean is I'd we rather come up
with some sort of self rating, than to delegate control to "THE COMMITTEE".
I don't mean to sound Orwellian (is that a word?) here, but at some point
(IMHO) every special interest group on the face of the planet is going 
to be electronically here.  Each with their own set of prejudices and 
info-fear screaming to regulate what we can see, read, listen to, and 
watch.  To quote Robert Frost, good fences make good neighbors. 

Enough complaining.  The solution is to make control of what comes over
the pipe solely in control of the client.  For example, what if the browser 
were to engage in key word searching of the text coming in.  The user could
maintain a profile of key words that indicate the subject matter *may*
be objectionable.  Again, this type of filter would not be viscous 
enough to allow *all* non-objectionable material through, nor restrictive
enough to prevent *some* objectionable material from appearing.  At least
then the control (and the fault for filter failure) remains in the hands 
of the user....

We made a big leap from voluntary filtering tools to censorship here.

First off, a poll:  I can very easily set up a separate mailing list for
discussions related to group and public annotations.  There are a lot of
people working on this and related systems, and while there are probably
enhancements to HTTP (and definitely to browsers and servers) needed to
implement this correctly, I think it's a big enough issue on its own to
merit separate discussions from www-talk.  Send me mail privately if you
have an opinion, and I'll act accordingly. 

Okay, now, two points about the above:

1) It's conceivable that the party being rated wouldn't be responsible 
for placing or maintaining that rating themselves; while, yes, this 
brings up the scary prospect of "officially sanctioned" content, it also 
means unethical content providers can't squelch or discourage unfavorable 
ratings.  I mean, can you imagine if Siskel and Ebert could only post 
their reviews on movie newspaper ads?  "Two thumbs up!" would be all 
you'd see. 

2) If a kid is smart enough to download his own version of NetScape, 
install it, and enters the URL for http://www.playboy.com/, I say he's 
smart enough to handle whatever he finds there.  Yes, this system is not
designed as a fail-safe system, but that doesn't mean that it's unusable.
Any grade schooler in the Bay Area can plop 75 cents into a newspaper 
vending machine and get "The Spectator".

    Unless we define some method of negotiating character set encoding for
    WWW, I think that the solution you outline above could not be
    implemented, though given encoding negotiation, it obviously *is* of
    great practical value.

Yes, encoding negotiation is what we have in DCE, and you're right
that such a method would be required for the Web as well.
    
    Interestly enough, I spoke to 2 technical documentation
    writer/translators who were vehemently against Unicode because it does
    not support every possible character in the world...
    
    Still, as a lowest common denominator, I think it will handle most
    (90%) situations, and I think *that* by itself, is a big step forward.

I agree that Unicode/ISO 10646 is a good solution when one
needs support for a universal code set. It does cover most
characters in use on computers today. However, there are
many cases when there's no need for a universal code set,
and it's certainly valid for local users to ask for support
for their own code sets -- or at least a representative
sample of them. 

There will never be a single code set that contains every
possible character in the world. Just as English keeps
inventing new words, Chinese, Japanese, and others keep
inventing new ideographs.

I second Brian Farrar's suggestion to put complete control in the hands
of the client. If a *local* (ie 'client') filtering system is workable
enough, that should defuse the pressure (anticipated and existing) to
censor the Web.
I teach Net usage workshops to public school teachers, and the question
of classrom control over content comes up often. It is a valid question,
IMHO, but I think the best solution is to put good tools in the hands
of the people who need or desire that kind of control, rather than
trying to create a webwide rating system which will only be circumvented
anyway.
Would it be possible from a programming pov to run a filter along with
existing browsers which would only permit access to a limited (pre-approved)
set of adresses? IOW, that way a teacher could permit access to say,
SpaceLink or the Smithsonian (or whatever) while denying access to other
sites? Any ideas, anyone?
I think it is vital that the Web community solve this problem before
others solve it for us ......

Subject: Joint SGML Open/WWW WG on style sheets -- DSSSL Lite
content-length: 2253

The SGML '94 conference held November 7-11 in Tysons Corner, Virginia, USA
provided an opportunity for many people from the SGML community and the WWW
community (and many of us from both) to meet, talk, and exchange a lot of
ideas.  The topic of "style sheets" was one of the more popular issues.

Various informal meetings were held throughout the week, and on Friday at
the SGML Open Technical Committee meetings, a group including
representation from a range of backgrounds met to discuss the feasibility
of defining a subset of the Document Style Semantics and Specification
Language (DSSSL).  The goal is that this subset--dubbed DSSSL Lite--could
form a core for a style sheet specification that would be simple yet
powerful enough to provide a basis for style sheet interchange on the Web.
If we can suggest something in a very short timeframe, it is hoped that it
will be used in the upcoming release of SoftQuad's Panorama SGML browser
software that will be distributed via NCSA along with Mosaic.

To meet our goals, we realize that we cannot address all style sheet issues
immediately.  However, working on the principle that any interchangeable
style information can only help browsers determine how to format
information, we believe that the interchange format for a useful subset of
style information can be developed quickly.  Furthermore, by basing our
subset on the Draft International Standard (DIS) version of the DSSSL
standard--which is currently out for vote (due to close before the end of
this year) to become an International Standard (IS)--there is a
well-defined extension path.

Further information and discussion
----------------------------------

The home page for DSSSL Lite information is at
<http://www.falch.no/~pepper/DSSSL-Lite/>.

In addition, there is a mailing list, sponsored by SGML Open but open to
all subscribers, for discussion of DSSSL Lite.  (Thanks to Falch for
administering it.)  To subscribe to the discussion list, send email to

There is no fundamental difference between a "censorship" SOAP and any other
sort of SOAP.  If you plan to add facilities for support of URC-based
retreival, all the mechanisms are in place to support censorship in the
browser, if desired.  If you consciously organize the spec to make
censorship difficult, you will likely make "good" SOAPs and other URC
operations more difficult.

[URI wg added to the distribution, since I discuss URC requirements herein.]

I have seen some productive discussion of SOAP-related issues recently on
the www-talk list.  I've been somewhat confused, however, by the sometimes
conflicting ideas of the purpose and intended implementation (from an
Interpedia point of view) of SOAPs.  There has been some discussion of
"central servers" and other types of centralized enforcement.  This is not
the intention at all.

SOAPs are intended to be maintained by a URC service.  The URC service
should be able to store meta-information created by an entity other than the
original publisher, so that I can rate articles as I come across them, and
others can use my ratings to help their searches.  I simply ask the URC
service for any SOAPs from a list of SOAP-publishers that may be attached to
a particular resource that I'm considering retrieving.  If I'm an
parental-controlled browser, I never allow links to X-rated resources;
otherwise, I simply note the type of SOAPs that have been attached for the
user's amusement.  No central authority is appropriate, since anyone can
claim that a resource is X-rated; it is simply a matter of who's word I want
to trust.

As you can see, it is not necessary that www.playboy.com rate their own
resources; some right-wing group would be more than happy to do that for
them.  A parental-controlled browser would simply pick an appropriate group
of SOAP-publishers to consult for each resource.  It would be unlikely to
trust Playboy's word, but it would probably trust the American Parental
Association or some-such.

I've been keeping a watchful eye on URC issues since this kind of wide
distribution is difficult to achieve.  Obviously, some sort of partial
lookup facilities are necessary.  Doing an exhaustive lookup for _all_ the
meta-information (or SOAPs) that have been attached to a particular resource
may take quite a while, and I may not want to wait; I should be able to do a
fairly good search without retrieving _all_ the URC information for a given
resource.  It would be nice to be able to incrementally continue a URC
lookup, so that if my initial attempts are not satisfactory, I can go lookup
more information.  Obviously, this kind of state information would be best
kept on the client.

I believe Christian Mogensen has come closest to the Interpedia vision of
SOAPs when he says:

  CM> ObWWW: for Meta information - if we want meta information to implement

Only allowing access to specific sites should be an ideal solution for 
schools and others.  If we wish to protect other people's children from what 
third parties may show - well what right have we?  We are arguing over who 
has the right to censorship and yet assuming we already have the right!

And anyway, if we restrict information flow over the Internet, we will 
immediately circumvent it ourselves!

I second Brian Farrar's suggestion to put complete control in the hands of 
the client. If a *local* (ie 'client') filtering system is workable enough, 
that should defuse the pressure (anticipated and existing) to censor the 
Web.

I teach Net usage workshops to public school teachers, and the question of 
classrom control over content comes up often. It is a valid question, IMHO, 
but I think the best solution is to put good tools in the hands of the 
people who need or desire that kind of control, rather than trying to create 
a webwide rating system which will only be circumvented anyway.

Would it be possible from a programming pov to run a filter along with 
existing browsers which would only permit access to a limited (pre-approved) 
set of adresses? IOW, that way a teacher could permit access to say, 
SpaceLink or the Smithsonian (or whatever) while denying access to other 
sites? Any ideas, anyone?

I think it is vital that the Web community solve this problem before others 
solve it for us ......

leaving aside the question of whether or not this is desirable (I have
doubts yet), it's extremely possible.  The HTTP proxy method is a
*great* way to implement document filtering.  For an example of how
proxies can be used as filters, see :

	http://www.cs.odu.edu/~page/2D/biffserv.html

I originally wrote these to demonstrate the feasibility of
prefiltering HTML documents before they are shown to the client.
Although these filters are meant as humor, the range of application is
quite broad...

Hi Jared,

Thanks for including the URI wg in teh discussion since I don't read
www-talk anymore. 

> I would note that the current URC scenario document has quite a different
> version of the SOAP vision.  Further comments on that document should be
> coming to the URI wg list soon.

As primary author of the scenarios document I look forward to those
comments.  I am not so sure that my vision of SOAPs differs drastically
from yours, perhaps I merely expressed it poorly in the scenarios
document. I certainly don't favor any sort of centralized SOAP
authority. If you get that impression from the scenarios document please
let me know because you shouldn't. To summarize my view of SOAPS:
1) Different organizations will review resources and if you
   want to know an organization's opinion about a resource then you ask
   them, and frequently you will have to pay to get their opinion.
2) If you have a URN for a resource and obtain the default URC for the
   resource, you will not see all the SOAPs for the resource, you will only
   see the ones that the publisher of the resource has seen fit to allow
   to be included in the URC.

Here is what I think a SOAP will look like in the default URC of a resource,
assuming we adopt an SGML syntax:

<urc>
 <urn>resource's URN here</urn>
 ...author, title, subject, location info deleted for brevity
 <review>
  <reviewer>URN:IANA:pta.org:self-descrip-94-02</reviewer>
  <capsule>-10, offensive sexual content; offensive language; nudity</capsule>
  <full>URN:IANA:pta.org:soaps/bambi_does_forest</full>
  <signature scheme="rsa">l;fjo4p;ine;roivherjhfgseufhw4oufhsdkhjgfb</signature>
 </review>
</urc>

A review element is a SOAP. It says who is doing the reviewing, by providing
a URN put out by the reviewing organization that talks about themselves.
It provides a quick rating using whatever scheme that reviewer adopts, -10..10
is OK by me for now, with flags for particular boogiemen. It has an optional
link to a full review (by giving its URN). Finally there is a digital
signature over that info so that the SOAP is difficult to forge. 

It is quite possible that playboy.com will include the PTA's negative
SOAPs in their URC server for a couple of reasons. Some customers will say
"show me the list of playboy.com URNs that the PTA REALLY hates". Also,
they can say to the government that they are not contributing to the
deliquincy of minors since they clearly carry the PTA SOAP - what more
can they do - its up to parents and teachers to make sure browsers
are configured to not show material the PTA has deemed unsuitable.

But, playboy.com is under NO obligation to include anyone's SOAPs. Similarly,
no publisher is required to provide any info they don't want to. That's what
the first amendment is all about. If you want to know what an organization 
you trust thinks of a resource, you ask the trusted organization, not the
publisher of the resource.

Anyway, I look forward to your more detailed comments on the URC scenarios.
Will you be at the IETF? If so we can chat about things then.

How would you propose this be done in a location-independent manner?  That
is to say, once URNs are here (soon!), what will it mean to restrict access
to a specific site, when the same resource is available elsewhere, and easy
mechanisms are in place to determine exactly where else it is available?

In other words, "access to specific sites" in _not_ an ideal solutions to
this problem.

It seems to me this would be entirely possible: just use any existing 
browser and give it an extremely limited domain name server -- and 
disable nslookup....  By adding a site to the DNS, you approve all its 
pages (without having to approve each page individually) but not 
necessarily all its links.

Any one student with net access outside of school could get around this 
pretty easily, but as others have mentioned, there will always be a way 
for a determined (or even not-so-determined) student to get around these 
systems.  At least this solution requires no new browsers, no extensive 
work on filters, etc.  In addition, any student who gets around it will 
have to learn something about IP addresses and how to find them, so the 
breach won't be a total loss.  :)

The core, in my opionion, to make any system useful and support the things
that I think most of us want to promote on the WWW.  

* This is not about how to restrict, but how to advise.

Schools could "subscribe" to an approval service so that their clients
would first check the "rating" from a central repository before accessing
the page.  It is easier to spend an additional $500/year and not have to
worry about www.playboy.com, or news:alt.sex.stories showing up on
their Elementrary school terminals.  At some level such an review board 
is going to have a nitch in this system.  

What I want to make sure is that we can make that nitch as small as
possible.  I don't want to have to pay an entity to review my content
before releasing to a "wide" audiance.  If at the very least we set up
a standard guidline system and can make it work, we might avoid the
need for the above entity.

Bottom line:
  When MCI ships you your copy of Netscape to run on your home PC,
  how can we insure that our information is accessable.  Without 
  going to a central guildline repository.

We need also to insure that it is difficult to get around this system,
yes if somebody can download and install a client, connect it to the
net, they get what they ask for.  At the same time when Dad does it
and sets it into advisory mode, we want to make sure _he_ feels safe.

Somehow we have strayed *far* afield from my original intention when I wrote
my "browser based filter" missive.  First of all it seems we have wandered
into the minefield of censorship (which is given excellent coverage in any
number of mailing lists).  

I thought the basis of the discussion was more aimed at the following: 
given the fact that many people want to use the WWW, and of those people 
some of them will find material that assaults their sensibilities, 
how can information continue to flow freely across the net for those that are 
not so faint of heart, while "protecting" the more fragile.  

Proxy's clearly are not the answer to this set of criteria. First, such a proxy
can only be administered for a group not an individual (in most cases).  Thus,
even the most benevolent gate master is making content type decisions for 
the rest of the "gated". And as Simon points out, site based filters can and
would
be circumvented.

The theory behind my browser filter idea was that the information is stopped
*only*
by the individual at his own "doorstep".  Based solely upon explicit
*content* based criteria (ie text
with the word "sex" in it).  Not based on a site (can a site really be "bad" or
does it just promote "bad things").  Yes I know a language and content based
filter
would be hard for an individual to administer, but shouldn't it be?  I
believe the answer is 
yes because it places responsibility for *censorship* solely in the hands of
the appropriate
authority -- me for myself and you for yourself (and your children if your
comfortable
with that).

Actually, this is an implementation detail which really doesn't
invalidate the statement that proxies can be good filters.  I can
easily imagine a sitewide filter which allows users to set their own
preferences, rather than some defaults.  I can also easily imagine
scenarios why sites would wish to block access globally to all their
users.

Since you seem to be asking for voluntary filtering anyway (the user
gets to set his filtering criteria) circumvention of the filter is
probably OK.  It just amounts to "don't filter anything" which is
certainly a valid criteria.

Actually, if you're going to stop the information flow, it makes sense
to try to stop it as close to the source as possible.  I wouldn't want
to transfer a long page through a slow PPP link, for example, only to
find that when it got there it was considered not suitable for
viewing.  I'd prefer the proxy, running on a well connected host, to
do that for me.  I'd get much quicker response that way.

Of course, there's no easy answer to the question of "Should it be
done?"  I guess it depends on circumstance.  My employer, for example,
certainly has the right to limit what I can and can't see, while my
internet provider probably doesn't.  And we won't even mention the
number of different technical approaches.  Proxies won't work for some
people, and they'll work great for others.  It's all a matter of
requirements...

I agree. While this certainly can be done by saving the image to a file 
and running external programs over it, some way to readily and simply 
check any comments on inline images, using the browser, is clearly desirable.

I suggested something along these lines a couple of weeks ago, in relation 
to the already existing author etc tags for TIFF

Having a link from the copyright symbol in an HTML 3 caption, or just in 
a paragraph after the image for HTML 2 documents, seems a reasonable 
and unobtrusive way to do this while avoiding special mouse/key jiggery 
pokery to get at the information. Its a link, select it like any other 
link. Just because the browser may be extracting the information on the 
fly and creating an internal HTML document to display it should not mean 
that the user has to select the link in a different manner.

Remind me, Joel. I don't recall saying that exactly.

			    *  *  *  *  *

  The CERN Common WWW Library is a general code base that can be used
  as a basis for WWW clients and servers. It contains code for accessing
  HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system. 
  Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting
  hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic programming
  utilities.

                            *  *  *  *  *

This pre-release is the first public version of the CERN Library with
support for non-blocking, interruptible multithreaded I/O. It is to be
considered as a beta release as it contains a significant amount of
modifications compared to the last version (2.17). The plan is to keep
up with modifications and steadily release improved versions of the
Library continuously until a desired level of stability and
functionality is reached.

The CERN Line Mode Browser is also released in order to show how the
multithreaded functionality can be enabled. The method used in the
Line Mode Browser is not limited to character-based clients but can
support GUI clients as well.

NOTE: The Library is not compatible with the CERN server 3.0 and it
should NOT be linked with this application. A later release of the
CERN server will support the current Library.

This release is also the first release of source code which is covered
by the new CERN copyright statement. The statement is published in the
file COPYRIGH - truncated to 8 bytes :-( and is a part of the
distribution file. It can also be read in hypertext format from

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Conditions/CERNFreeofCharge.html

We encourage everybody to study this statement - questions are welcome!

CERN Common Code Library 3.0pre2 is available as source code from:

        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_3.0pre2.tar.Z

Its is known to compile on Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake, NeXT, NeXT-386,
Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI and AIX, but look also at the page
of supported platforms at:

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Platform/Platform.html

Diffs and old versions are available at

        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/old
        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/diffs

The top-node for documentation on the library is available at 

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html and

Programmer's Guide is available at

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html

The documentation has been modified significantly since the last
release. New ideas and comments are welcome!

CERN Library 3.0pre1 Release Notes

New or Changed Features:

* Introduced the function HTLibInit() and HTLibTerminate() which MUST
  be called when the application starts up and terminates.

* Introduced the modules HTThread and HTEvent. HTEvent is the
  client interface when using multithreaded functionality and HTThread
  is the internal socket management

* All __STDC__ defines now concentrated to HTUtils.html where it is 
  called _STANDARD_CODE_ so that _cplusplus also handles this

* `new' and `template' not used a names anymore (confuses C++)

* Removed from field in HTRequest structure. This is now handled by
  the functions HTGetMailAddres and HTSetMailAddress and the flag HTEnableFrom
  in the HTTP module.

* Changed HTSetMailAddress so that a call with parameter equals NULL
  or "" clears the contents of the mail-address.

* The number of parameters to Streamstack function is now compatible
  with the arguments to a stream converter, so that we don't loose any
  information while putting up the stream stack.

* HTOutputSource variable is removed. You should use WWW_SOURCE in the
  request structure

* HTGuess stream is a a converter compatible stream so that it
  actually can be setup as a converter

* The stream methods `abort' and `_free' now returns int instead of
  void. On success from these methods `_free' returns 0 and `abort'
  return EOF

* Taken HTEscape and HTUnescape and put them into the HTEscape
  module. The functionality is the same but now they can be used in 
  utility programs without linking in the whole Library

Bug Fixes:

* Removed bug in WAIS module which caused a lot of core dumps

* Removed bug in format classification from URL suffix in HTGoper when
  the file was plaintext
 
* `localhost' is now recognized again after canonicalization in HTLoadFile()

* WAIS SEARCH now produces proper HTML

* Max number of lines in WAIS decreased to 200 as 250 (previous) dumps core

* Bug fixed in HTGetHostName if we must use the getdomainname() function.

* Added some support for SCO

* Handling of gopher items of type ERROR (3) changed so no more core
  dumps in server

CERN Library 3.0pre2 Release Notes

* Introduced memory cleanups from Eric Sink into HTLibTerminate() 

* Now the client can provocate a call to HTEventRequestTerminate even
  when the request never enters the eventloop. This is necesary so that
  the client can cancel busy icons, spinning globes etc.

* Introduced EVENT_TERM as return code for the HTEventHandler function

* HTEventHandler now has a ** pointer so that the request pointer can
  be modified from the client

* Fixed bug in HTSearch and HTLoadRelative where wrong return code was
  returned (BOOL instead of int)

* Introduced BlockingIO field in the request structure to override the
  the mode registered in the protocol structure. This can be used as an
  easy way to make blocking I/O

Have fun!

  The CERN Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web Browser.
  It is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for the
  CERN Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non-
  interactive mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety
  of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is
  primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or
  used in batch jobs.

                            *  *  *  *  *

This is the announcement of the first public release of the
multithreaded CERN Line Mode Browser. It is a pre-release as much has
changed in the Library and the browser. The plan is to keep up with

CERN Line Mode Browser Release Notes

Pre-release 3.opre1

Most of the code is reorganized in order to adapt the application to
the multithreaded version of the Library. This means that the browser
	now has the following new features:

* Interruptible I/O - hit 'z RETURN' and the current load terminates

* You can at any time initiate a new load or any other command by
  simply start typing.

Pre-release 3.opre2

* The browser is now much more stable and has the same amount of
  functionality as the previous version 2.15

A real killer app - try it - it is really fun!

The talk about SOAPs does not add any conceptual or technical value to
what any generic annotations framework should provide anyway.

For example, in the framework of http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/FRESCO a
soap would simply be an annotation set with READ permission open to
'anyone', and WRITE only to the issuing organization. Browsers can
then filter on the annotation content (which is typed in case of
soaps).

  >link to a full review (by giving its URN). Finally there is a digital
  >signature over that info so that the SOAP is difficult to forge. 

Unnecessary machinery in the general case where soaps/annotations are
not under control of the document server.  (Then forging a soap
amounts to forging a host name---which is sufficiently unlikely for
most practical cases.)

While I disagree that this is an "implementation detail" (in fact in the case

quite fair. I
was unfortunately generalizing about proxy implementation to make the point that
the *user* must make the decisions.

I meant simply that given a proxy with a design objective to filter

This an elegant, network resource conservative approach.  When taken to
its extreme (which David *clearly* does not intend) the filterer's (is that
a word) would want to stop it *at* the source.  Its just my opinion, but
I prefer that the slow transfer be a cost to the user and not to the 
user community.  Besides the slow link problem evaporates overtime as
bandwidth/throughput costs decline.  Imagine fiber in the local loop! 
Suddenly a little Hyper-Text Doc is but a bug speck on the proverbial

+------------------

I agree almost completely.  So long it as it is your employer telling
you what you can and can't see over *his/her* (I guess at NASA that would be
Uncle Sam's) link.  These are not irreconcilable positions either.  Because,
in effect, the employer *is* the user (through your actions of course) and
is therefore exercising a clear right to choose how company resources are
expended.  I think that's your point and I agree with it.

Again, I must basically agree with Mr. Farrar. My own suggestion for a 
'filter' was perhaps misworded. Rather than filtering *out* everything
supposedly 'bad', I wondered if it were possible for, a school, for 
instance, to only allow pointing *to* sites which are 'OK' - which
would mean (in practice) not only sites which have no sexual content, 
but simply sites which have proven clasroom value. If you've ever tried
to keep a room full of people, sitting at different net connected computers
focussed on a single subject, you'll know what I mean.
<emphasis>
If there is to be any kind of 'filter', I feel strongly that it should
be in the control of the client (or his parents....). I am very suspicious
of wide area censorship or rating system in any form. I think the only
solution is to put workable tools in the hands of users - to use or ignore
as they see fit. If they see something they don't like, it is entirely
their responsibility.

I see two possible solutions:

1. The quick-and-dirty "trusted host" strategy: somebody suggested
crippling your client's DNS service to only know about "approved"
hosts.

Some gethostbyname() implementations support using environment
variables to control configuration, so this could be a low-hassle
solution: you could use existing pre-compiled WWW clients. You set
some environment variable like DNS_HOSTS to a file that looks like an
/etc/hosts file, but only lists www sites that you approve of.

Even simpler: most client hosts have a "nameserver" configuration
variable somewhere: in the Mac's control panel, or something like
that.  Point that to a nameserver that you cripple as above, and
you're in business.


There's a lot of trust here:

	* you're trusting that your local users won't fudge with the
	system to get around all this

	* you're trusting the administrators of the remote hosts to
	maintain complete editorial control of the material on their
	hosts. If you pubt www.foo.com in the list of trusted
	hosts, then the webmaster there can't
	let joeuser put nudy pictures in
		http://www.foo.com/~joeuser/nudies/

	* you're trusting that there are no "black hats" between you
	and www.foo.com that would spoof DNS to make www.foo.com point
	to www.playboy.com


But all of the above is reasonable, given the relatively low cost of a
"security breach."



The other model is the industrial-grade, cryptography-based solution:

2. You configure your client to not show any information unless there
is a certificate that says it's OK. The PTA (or whatever certifying
agency) could sign keys of various institutions, and those
institutions would provide digital signatures of the data they send.

This is black-hat proof, but it relies on the local users not finding
a way around it. Like somebody (Tony Sanders?) said, if local users
can write programs or install software, they can get access to
whatever they want.

This might be suitable for stand-alone kiosks and such.


Hmmm... now that I think about it, authenticated DNS will probably be
deployed long before widespread use of cryptographically strong SOAPs.

So solution #1 may turn out to be better than solution #2, even in the
long run!

One minor clarification, which only slightly contradicts my previous 
message, and which I forgot about :-)

http-ng has two main ways of representing metainfo records. Commonly used,
and operationally significant fields are represented directly as fields 
in the meta-info record. this includes values such as content types, 
titles, copyright info and authorship information. Other, more detailed
cataloging information is sent in a format derived from MARC (the standard
for library cataloging). The broken MARC encoding scheme isn't used, but all
tags and subfields correspond to those used in USMARC. 

This does include some information as to the potential sutiablity of 
a work for juveniles, and I believe there may be support for movie ratings in
another field (I didn't bring my copy of the marc catalog with me, and 
at the moment I don't think i could pick it up:(

unimarc could be substituted for usmarc, but i think it loses more than 
it gains.

Actually a friewall can be configured to do this. Most routers can be
configured to reject packets by source. My Workstation can even drop
TCP/IP packets at the kernel level if it dosen't like them...

I very much doubt it. There are already enough users of S-HTTP for 
backwards compatibility to be raised as an issue in the HTTP crypto 
spec.


There is a practical alternative. Most publishers of porno material are
actually quite responsible and are happy to put an X-Rating or similar on 
it. Provided they can publish to adults most companies do not want to
willfully "corrupt" children.

Voluntary identification of possibly offensive material at least provides 
a first pass at filtering it out. There should of course be categories since
not everyone agrees about the definition of obscene. Some people consider
pictures of naked humanoids to be obscene (especially if they are engaged in
the action of making more humanoids). I consider the Republican party
platform to be obscene and immoral.

So first cut at a protocol -

Reject: nudity; level=0.1, obscenity; level=0.0...

Where Reject is in the same line as "accept", by default the reject filter
is Nil.


And on the reply:

Content-Censorship: nudity; level=0.1 ...


The tags would be:-

nudity		content contains nudity. Levels:-
			0.1	Mamary glands
			0.8	Whole body	
			1.0	Gynecological close ups.


[gosh this is damn pointless]

Anyway it would not take much to add this into the clients and servers at a 
fairly basic level - it would be permissible for a simple server to apply
the same ratings to all documents at that site.


What I refuse to do is to write out the damn rating guide. Actualy it is
a cultural-unification-complete problem. It is not possible to come up with
an acceptable set of tags unless you achieve cultural conformity. Since I
don't want that to occur anyway I will settle for a non optimal set of tags.

Issues:-

1)	Yes I know this is a band aid with precious little effect but then
	again how many copies of Penthouse are bought by pimply 15 year olds?
	In any case if the aledgedly moral minority want secure censorship
	let them work out a solution.

2)	Culture clash. What is acceptable in some societies is aboslutely
	unacceptable to the power elite in others. In some cases the destruction
	of social values by exposure of the power elite to oprobrium is not
	only justified but very necessary. Consider that the Egyptian 
	authorities are prosecuting several men for conducting Female
	circumcision after the recent CNN report (which they initialy
	made attempts to censor).

	The clashes between censorily permissive societies such as the
	Netherlands, Scandinavia etc and repressive societies such as Saudi
	Arabia are well defined. At both extreemes the policies adopted 
	are primarily political. In the case of permissive countries the
	policies back up a cultural self-determination whereby the virtues
	of a small state in being able to reject despotism are asserted.
	In the case of repressive societies censorship in the social sphere
	is used as justification for political censorship and moreover
	defers wider social changes which may be a threat to the power
	elite.

3)	"Moral", by which is really meant social censorship which encompasses
	pornography cannot be separated from wider gender issues such as the
	permissable roles for females in society.

	In some societies the display of female ankles is considered obscene,
	in  such cases the role of such censorhip in maintaining the social
	order is easy to see. Idealisation of the female form underpins a
	wider idealisation of the role of females in society where idealisation
	is to be interpreted in the sense of enforcing conformity. The argument
	may be put in either patronising or demeaning forms - Women being
	more perfect beings than men must not be subjected to worldly evils,
	or Women being inherently evil must not be allowed to lure men into
	licensiousness. The bimodal nature is required as a matter of social
	stability since most men will be married and they can hardly marry an
	inherently evil creature. The bimodal nature allows them to patronise
	their wives and daughters and chose between being demeaning or
	patronising to others.


There is a company offering to censor DNS space for schools for a mere
$50000 per annum. I think we can do rather better without cost, or at least
without opportunistic costing of that order.

	As it was pointed out by Philip Hallam-Baker, the level of
accectability varies very much in different cultures: somewhere even
faces of women are not allowed, some other places accept anything but
close-ups of genitals.

	One sollution would be using proxy server and not allowing any
direct connections.  The server could then filter all non-allowed
sites or documents.  The server could be allow-by-default or
deny-by-default according to level of paranoid.  Some organization
could keep lists and deliver them to those who want them.  Of cource,
sites could voluntary tell "we have x-rated material".

	This would solve problem of using own browsers, but of cource
one could use some internet provider and get access to those forbid
files.  And one could use some url-by-mail server.

	Using lists allows to restrict access to other material than
sexual.  One could for example forbid some anti-capital-punisment site
-- or do you think they would set up 
Content-Censorship: human-rights; level=1.0
headers in their reply or that they obey

header?

	If someone is going to "protect" other people, (s)he should
have the trouble.  I'm not going to think about my documents that
"this seems to contain religious material, subtype

We had a problem with some people downloading porn stuff with company
workstations during business hours which was (in political terms) "an
invalid use of company resources".  What we did was set up a proxy
that would pass only certain sites which were "pre-approved for business
reasons".  Since all workstations are behind a firewall, this seemed to
be an easy (but imperfect) solution.

I know this goes against the grain of many people, but we found that certain
people were just using the Web for strictly non-business/research purposes 
and were becoming massively unproductive from a business perspective.  I 
think that the politics are going to change back to a more open policy
(which would be good IMHO), but a proxy configuration seems to do what you
desire.

There's another issue to consider here, too.  In universities there are
often huge numbers of users on a system at any given time, with limited
disk space and CPU cycles.  Whether or not downloading porn pictures is
"an invalid use of institution resources" it's just a big fat pain in
the ass.  Those pictures use up tremendous amounts of disk space, and
serve no legitimate academic purpose.  Many of them violate copyrights.

To me, excluding porn sites (and similar Usenet newsgroups) is no more
censorship than excluding cheap gossip rags from a university library's
list of standing orders.

Let the undergraduate weanies jerk off over magazines they bought them-
selves, and stop wasting everyone else's time and disk space ;-).

In reply to Chris Lilley's comments of 11/23, on the topic of CGM and
the proposed Simple Vector Format (SVF) for WWW...

I will elaborate some on my original mail, which was probably too brief
to be useful outside of its originally intended audience; and I'll 
respond to some of Chris's points. 

In overview, I want to make two basic points:

1.  Recent work on CGM extensions (and the CGM:1992 republication)
provide the features to *enable* hot-link applications, with either
embedded or external link definitions.

2.  Formats follow from requirements (or should do so).  I have been
involved in standards requirements work for several years, including:
the exhaustive requirements studies (with associated ANSI and ISO
ballots) to define the new CGM:1992 capabilities; the work of several
application communities (CALS, ATA, petroleum, ODA, NITF, etc) who have
defined profiles of CGM (as well as IGES and other formats); and the
requirements work for the CGM Amd.2 "Application Structuring".  

Graphics in electronic documents has been a prominent application in all
of this, including inline graphics, networked document applications,
intelligent graphics and IETM (interactive electronic technical manual),
hypermedia and multimedia.  Nothing I have seen in the WWW dialog and
papers so far represents truely novel or unique requirements.  Therefore
I assert that it is highly likely that the proposed "SVF" work can be
based on existing formats (such as CGM), rather than a totally
incompatible "from scratch" effort. 


To respond to a couple of the detailed comments of Chris...

>Do a search for CGMs on http and ftp 
>sites - most are 1987 CGM generated by Corel Draw.

Technical clarification: CGM:1987 is almost identical to the Version 1
level of CGM:1992 -- *almost* because the latter has incorporated a
number of "Defect Corrections" to the former.  For most practical
purposes they are the same, but the latter should always be used instead
of the former, because of these defect corrections (in the words of the
ISO standard, CGM:1992 "supersedes and replaces" CGM:1987).  CGM:1992
adds a lot of graphical horsepower in upward compatible Version 2 and
Version 3 levels.  V2 and V3 features are just starting to appear in
implementations.  The 1987 CGM from Corel Draw, assuming it was legal
in 1987, is likely valid under 1992. 

>> This is wrong.

>I hope you mean, the first sentence is wrong (which it is; thanks for the 
>information about Amd. 2 which I was unaware of). The second one is, of course, 
>correct.

Yes, that is my meaning -- I was too brief in my comments here.

Some comments on the body of Chris's message...

Chris is correct that Amd.2 provides the "enabling technology" for hot
links to URL (or anything), but that the actual extensions must be
defined by the application community.  In this case, the mechanism of a
Profile is appropriate.  The WWW community would define a particular
Application Structure (or structures) to accomplish the job.  A subset
of other CGM functions to provide an equivalent to SVF could also be
defined. 

Profiles can be registered by a relatively quick process within ISO
(they are called International Standardized Profiles, ISP).  This
approach (if adequately publicized) minimizes the chance that a second,
equivalent, but incompatible flavor from being defined (such is the
purpose of ISPs).  

As Chris notes, profiles have helped to suppress the earlier
incompatible flavors of CGM.  I believe the same would be true of a
hot-linked WWW application, and it would also minimize the problem of
"browser bloat" which Chris anticipates. 

>Furthermore, the hotlinks would then be intimately associated with the
>CGM, so if you want to use the same CGM in different situations you need
>to make copies of the CGM and edit the Application Structures to suit. 
>
>It is not at all obvious that this is the way to proceed.

If I'm understanding his comments correctly, Chris is concerned with the
"intimate" embedding of the link information in the CGM itself (which,
by the way, is apparently just what the SVF Specification defines). 
Whether link information, application intelligence, etc, should be
internal to the graphical file or external is one of the main issues
amongst early adopters of Amd.2 (for example, the Intelligent Graphics
initiative of the Air Transport Association, ATA).  There are two
schools of thought: the structures and links should be embedded; or, the
structures and links should be in an associated "overlay" file.  I have
seen proposed scenarios for use of CGM and Amd.2 in both approaches. 

At this point, I'm going to defer to those who are more actively
involved in WWW, or in IETMs in other communities (such as CALS and
ATA), to debate and craft the particular solution.  However from my
current understanding of the WWW requirements, it still appears that CGM
has the needed attributes to serve as a basis for the SVF work. 

>People said that in 1987 about CGM ;-)  [yet another graphics file format?]

When work commenced on CGM in 1981, there was no suitable open standard
equivalent to CGM's place in the information pipeline (or Computer
Graphics Reference Model [CGRM], if you prefer).  In 1987 there still
wasn't.  In 1992 there still wasn't.  There still isn't.  At least not a
standard.  Perhaps the latter attribute -- that the format be a stable,
open, international standard -- is not important.

Although this point is peripheral to the main issue of this discussion,
I'd like to one statement above.  File formats at this level in the
information pipeline are not as rare as Chris implies.  From the Table
of Contents and off the top of my head, I've come up with at least a
dozen more at roughly the same position in the reference model (GEM VDI,
Harvard Graphics CHT, HDF, IGES, Lotus PIC, Macintosh PICT, Microsoft
RTF, Microsoft WMF, NAPLPS, MET [Presentation Manager Metafile],
WordPerfect Graphics Metafile, MIF, etc.) 

Most of these are probably unsuitable for functional reasons (which
perhaps is why Chris excluded them), or because they are proprietary and
not open standards (which characteristic is shared by EPS and DXF). 

>So, my original comment still stands: A new format is fine if it does a 
>different job (if not, it is not fine). Surely Lofton does not argue with this?

If in fact it is really a "different job".  Clearly, the file format
definition follows from the requirements.  As I indicated at the start,
most of the requirements which I have heard in this dialog, in the
"Moline paper," and other discussions are familiar.  If this is the
case, then "SVF" will be isomorphic to a profile of one or more existing
formats. 

>Reading the original propsal for moline, it seems that some thought has
>gone into the proposal which I assume Lofton read before commenting on
>it.  I would therefore be interested to hear his specific objections to
>it, apart from the fact that it has not settled on CGM.  Then again, it
>has not NOT settled on it either, as the paper makes clear. 

I question the last statement.  As you no doubt know, there is a draft
specification of SVF -- "Specification for the Simple Vector Format
(SVF)".  The functionality, syntax, and encoding are already designed,
from scratch.  A table in the paper presents comparative file sizes on a
couple of sample pictures for several file formats (DXF, HPGL, IGES,
raster format, and of course SVF).  CGM is not mentioned at all. 

The Moline paper does propose a reasonable way forward -- requirements
determination from all sectors of industry, "lively discussion", etc.,
leading to the design of a format.  I'm a bit confused how this fits together
with the already-written and fairly complete SVF definition. 

Finally, Chris asked for specific comments against the Moline paper. 
I'll make a few about the paper and the SVF Specification itself. 


1.  The articulated goals of the "SVF", and the problem to be solved,
are sound.  But they are not unique to the WWW, and in fact several
other application communities (e.g., ATA, CALS, ...) have been
addressing them for several years.  Hence I repeat my assertion, SVF
likely can and should be a profile of an existing format. 

2. The tradeoffs and criteria for the encoding of "SVF" functionality are
familiar: transmission speed? file size? format robustness in the face
of possible data loss? translation speed? These were faced during CGM
standardization.  They can be mutually contradictory.  Perhaps the
answer is not a single syntax to encode the functionality, but one or
more equivalent syntaxes (CGM defined three equivalent encodings, each
optimized for different criteria). 

3.  About the proposal to look at existing formats, and eliminate those
that are too simple "or too complex": the latter should not justify a
"from scratch" definition of a new format.  Rather, a subset or
"Profile" of an existing format should be used, if all other factors are
acceptable with a candidate format.  This has been commonly done with
IGES and CGM in various electronic documentation communities.  As Chris
pointed out, it was done for EPS as well.  Looking at the SVF
Specification document itself, the graphical functionality could easily
be a simple Profile of CGM.  (The encoding doesn't match any of the
standard ones.  If all of the standard ones are truely inadequate, for
well defined reasons, then one could consider defining a new encoding.)

3. I believe that the difficulty and magnitude of the Requirements
Determination phase of an SVF project have been vastly underestimated,
if this is truely to be a "consensus format" as implied in the Moline
paper.  The difficulty of collecting requirements, refining them into a
concise and accurate set, and reaching consensus, is the principal
reason that ISO standards take so long to develop. 

4. The current SVF Specification document does indeed define a simple
format.  I believe that it is too simple to be very useful for the
claimed applications:  "...GIS maps, scientific data, financial charts,
facility layouts, architectural and engineering designs, and more."
All of these areas were studied during the requirements work for CGM
Version 3, and have been studied by various application communities
since.  SVF lacks basic facilities for effective data representation in
several areas, for example: line drawing attributes, filled area styles and
primitives, integrated vector/raster overlays, etc...

SVF is reminiscent of a profile definition that was once proposed in the
ODA (Office Document Architecture) community, but SVF is even simpler. 
The ODA profile was critized by graphics experts (and ultimately
discontinued, I believe), in part because it was judged to be too simple
to be useful, even for simple technical illustrations, presentation
graphics, etc. 

Here is where the Requirements Determination for WWW becomes critical. 
How simple can the "SVF" be? What do you do when it lacks a rudimentary
capability, without which one cannot efficiently represent the graphic
(e.g., text direction, fill pattern, etc)? What is the "growth" path for
those SVF users who suddenly have a picture that they cannot efficiently
represent? 

5.  The SVF Specification does seem anticipate continued evolution of
the specification, and discusses enhancements so that "older viewers
[can] display most of a new file so the user could at least see some of
the file." First comment: why not simply choose a syntax which allows
new elements to be skipped, since the SVF version is embedded in each
file.  Second comment: is this really useful? How often is a user going
to be interested in a picture known to be wrong or incomplete? Example:
the addition of a new "bold text" attribute causes an old viewer to drop
the "NOT" from the string: "The valve direction in the reactor coolant
line should NOT be reversed".  Humor aside, this should not be a high
priority requirement.

6.  The existing SVF Specification is not adequate for an implementation
of the format.  It is surprising how much has to be written to make a
completely unambiguous and standalone specification, even of a simple
format (which is another reason that standards take so long).  There
should be "standards quality" document, if SVF is truely to be an open
and accessible format. 


There are many other technical and procedural points that could be
raised about the paper and the specification.  Presumably these will
start to be flushed out, should the proposed open process of defining an
"SVF" for WWW take place.

Lofton Henderson.

I have been playing with CCI (Common Client Interface)

like to discuss the following -

1. What is the status of CCI? 

   Is it going to be a standard interface (RFC)? 

2. Are other browsers except Mosaic 2.5b are using it?

   How hard is it to implement at the browser side?

3. Suggestions for future functionality of CCI

   3.1 Add a window_id to CCI calls so that it is possible
       to interact with a particular window (clone) inside the browser.
   
   3.2 Be able to control windowing properties (x-y location, size, 
       scrolling position ...) of the browser and let
       the browser report its properties through CCI.

This may be the classic "to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a

Ouch, that's funny.  I guess the relationship to censorship is that a proxy
like this could replace censored words?

I think I'm going to use this in my talk on agents at Internet World this

The current version of CCI has a fatal flaw: it does not communicate  
the URL of data passed between different viewers.

Because there are an increasing number of Web-enhanced formats  
(Hyper-TeX, WebOOGL, VRML, etc.), assuming the HTML viewer to be the  
"master" is no longer a viable model.  In order for relative URLs to  
work, viewers must communicate *full* information about the data to  
be displayed by another viewer, including (especially) its URL.

This ties up with a discussion I had with Simon Spero at the Chicago
conference. There is emerging a picture of requirements which people 
have raised which is heading in the direction of a browser implementation
along the lines of X-Windows Window Managers. This would have a user 
interface controller, preferences database, and the ability to zone a page
handing over control of each zone to a module capable of viewing the 
appropriate data. This would allow more tightly integrated 'pages' of
text, graphics, vr etc. It would be more extensible, particularly if the
back end is also a modularised protocol suite.

There are obviously also disadvantages to this model, but I think that
the current trend for UNIX browsers to use this type of idea anyway ( 
with the X-windows window manager being the integrator ) shows that people
like it. Making this approach more tightly coupled would present a 
'neater' view to the user.

I believe that the tk-WWW browser is already heading down this route ? 
 
Advantages
1) Extensibility
2) Tighter coupling between connected data in a 'virtual page'

Disadvantages 
1) Needs metainformation for requested size of 'zone', gravity, scroll 
   attributes etc.
2) Requires a SET of standards for controller -> viewer communication and
   viewer->controller->protocol module communication
3) Probably requires standards for viewer ->controller->Viewer manipulation
   ( go via the controller so that e.g. mappers can work properly )

Any comments ?

If you restrict the discussion to the "First World" European industrial 
democracies, I agree with you.  This is but a small fraction of the world's 
population -- China alone (a communist dictatorship) contains 20% of the 
world population.  Even authoritarian regimes in general try to control 
information access whether by press, TV, or computer.

Alas, even industrial democracies have the habit of restricting access to 
entertainment products, whether because of offensive content (a US 
preoccupation) or because of NPH (Not Produced Here).  Before I get flamed, 
I should state that I know Sturgeon's Law applies to US entertainment 
products ("90% of everything is crap"); the point is adults should use their 
own crap detectors rather than having their government decide for them what 
is and is not worthwhile entertainment.

This is a *World-Wide* Web, after all...

May I suggest my W3A proposal? It is an API: every `applet' consists
of a few compiled functions and is dynamically loaded by the central
browser. There are 5 types of applets: agent, filter, viewer,
printer-driver, and accessory.

Advantages: applets are small, can be distributed in binary, are easy
to write.

Disadvantages: no support for interpreted languages yet (but a Python
interface is likely to be developed)

External viewers a la Mosaic are already supported, by means of a
90-line applet. M-CCI could be supported in the same way.

Not necessarily. It only shows that this is easy to do under UNIX/X11.

To me it seems like a hack solution. An integrated user interface
(like Netscape) is far more appealing.

The integrated user interface is why this model works.
At the moment, every view is started up externally ( except for the inline
special cases ). With the suggested model of a 'page manager' rather than
a browser like Mosaic, all viewers share the user interface of the page
manager. This is similar to the way that all windows under X share the
UI of the windows manager.
I believe that this gives a *much* greater degree of integration in the 
user interface than the current situation of totally un-integrated external
viewers.
( Note : I am not suggesting that X-windows be used as the page manager, 
just something like it but with a higher level of integration ).

Hello all,

 
  First Id like to say that there isnt that much bad stuff out there on
 the  internet. Sure playboy has one naughty pic a month but not much
 else. In fact   the worst ive seen on the net apart from that on
 playboy is a pic of cindy crawford in a swimming suit!! Okay but maybe
 there are a few sex chatlines out there but its hardly worth having a
 nightmare over.

 

  Second i was thinking that a very simple type of censorship could be
implemented by making the browser not connect to paths that have key
words in them anywhere like sex or playboy or erotic.
  This way you wouldnt have to wait ages for a file to load before being
told you arent allowed to access it, and secondly sites like playboy
and other sites wont be able to get around the restriction without
changing their name and that will be one very big hassle for obvious
reasons.
  
  For instance a path of HTTP://snoopy.com/erotic/archives 
 
  would not be allowed to proceed by the browser.  Of course this
wouldnt cut out all bad stuff but it would cut out almost all of it.


  Thirdly heres a real easy to answer question but i dont know too much
about this stuff yet.
  Anyway what i was wondering was how do mosaic and gopher access sites
and what passwords and login user IDs do they use.  The reason i ask is
because the sites can probably be accessed by FTP or TELNET but you
need particular IDs and passwords which i cant find (ive tried
anonymous and guest, but they wont work).

  I would greatly appreciate any help on the above question,
  
            Upi

A good idea.

I think we need a system for running applications which
create their main window in the Viewer window and there is
two way communication with the Viewer window.

The problem that I can see is that we need to support
several platforms here, and the source for one *external*
will need to cross compile, not only on different unix
platforms, but also on micros.

This is not so much of a problem with the unix to MS-Windows
porting since they use a similar window manager idea, and
you can create a child off a window handle without
actually knowing who (or what program) created it.

The Macintosh however does not support this idea at all, the
idea of child interface objects not existing on the Mac.

Any ideas on this?

I'm writing a cross platform application framework which
supports this kind of idea but can only implement it on
the Mac as a series of applications communicating by
AppleEvents.

This is NOT enough!

Hopefully...
Malcolm.

Wow.   This tells me we really do want a more general "STAY ALIVE"
or "KEEP CONNECTION" model.   I was feeling a little shy about putting
forth my own suggestion(s),  but I've got "running code".   All I need
is that "rough concensus" to meet the Dave Clark Criterion.   ;-)

If you telnet to ua1vm.ua.edu port 80,  you get a shell.   No prompt,
but a shell nontheless.   That's really what an HTTP server is.
This "shell" supports five commands:  GET, POST, HELP, VERSION, and QUIT.
GET, POST, and QUIT all result in closing the connection,  but HELP
and VERSION leave it open.   (I don't think a machine would know when
it got to EOF;  but these were intended for human consumption or even
just for play)

What I'd like to see is some new "command" for this shell that would
be the equivalent of a GET but that would not require closing the
connection to signal EOF.   There are two possibilities:  introduce some
SET verb to set any number of flags,  the first one we implement being
STAY_ALIVE or KEEP_CONNECTION, or some such,  -or-  introduce some new
verb that means GET+STAY_ALIVE,  say GET_ALIVE,  or maybe  GET_ALIFE?
The latter would immediately imply a companion  POST_ALIVE  verb.

If the verb were MGET,  I'd prefer for it to have the same syntax as GET.
Since multiple bundles must be returned,  I see no reason why they all
need be requested by a single MGET command,  as some syntaxes put forth
would provide.   Keeping the connection open is what we need,  not a
reduction in the number of "commands" issued by the client.

I would like to see a definition of Content-type-encoding: packet.
Specifically, which bytes are included in the byte count?  CRLF's?
</excerpt>

I think we've already seen this a couple of times.   The one I liked was
Dan Connolly's Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet,  which is something like

4000 CR/LF
... 4000 bytes of data (including CR/LFs) ...
123 CR/LF
... 123 bytes more data ...
-1
... signals EOF ...

In English,  after the header  (and after the blank line that follows it)
comes a number of octets on a line by itself.   The CR/LF is part of this,
after which the receiver switches to  "byte counting mode"  in which it
stays until it has received the indicated number of octets.   It probably
helps if these packets are on the order of 4K or 8K or so,  though some
negotiation would help.   If any such preferred block size prevails,
then the last packet will usually be something shorter.   End-of-file
is indicated by a negative number.   I recommend we NOT use zero for EOF
for the (unlikely) case when someone decides they need to send a few
zero length packets.

<excerpt>
Is the data uuencoded?  Or are the bytes assumed to be binary data?
</excerpt>

There's no need for anything to be encoded,  UU or B64 or any,
because we're on TCP and "packet" is itself a Content-Transfer-Encoding.

For the connection to remain open,  there must of necessity be an
alternative EOF signal to what we've used up to now,  closing the socket.
CTE "packet"  (or something like it)  gives us the required intermediate EOF.

I definitely agree that the componentware approach to tommorow's WWW software
is the way to go.  Let me give you a couple more examples that make this
infinitely better than what the monolithic browser model can handle.

Once the HTTP (and other protocol)-communication code is separated into an
independent object, it can be integrated into _any_ software that supports the
respective object model.  Thus, a word processor could retrieve documents via
HTTP, Gopher, or FTP just as easily as retrieving them from the local hard disk
or LAN, it would also be able to use the HTML parser object to convert the file.
A database application could opt to use HTTP, WAIS, or Z39.50v3 as well as
SQL to do remote lookups.  In my field, we could have Geographic Information
Systems software where map themes on the local disk could be combined with 
themes stored anywhere else without having to first download all the data.

In this model, today's NetScape or Mosaic would be a "federation" (in the Swiss
sense) of the following modules:
HTTP transport
Gopher transport
NNTP transport
WAIS transport
FTP transport
Local file I/O
Printer control
HTML parser
Gopher menu parser
GIF/JPEG/XPM/etc parsers
Document Manager

In addition, new modules could be added/upgraded as necessary:
VRML parser
SVF/CGM parser
MPEG player
Sound players
PostScript parser
Acrobat/Envoy/Folio parsers
HTML 3 parser
HTTP 2 transport
Gopher+ transport
Z39.50 transport

Unlike what some have worried about, these modules need not be split into 9
windows cluttering up the screen.  The componentware browser would look the
same as it does today, using the Document Manager to integrate everything 
into a single multimedia document (unless the user/provider wants separate
windows).

Now that I've given all that ideal, I must ask that we not reinvent the wheel
by developing a new object sharing model (at least nothing more complex than
CCI).  We are not the only ones moving toward componentware, and models abound.
I firmly believe that we should rely on emerging industry standards such as
CORBA and OpenDoc (see the May 1994 Byte for a good introduction to this
concept and the coming standards), which should have all the power we need.

I agree.  That is why a mechanism at the browser end for restricting 
available material is (IMHO) a good idea.  It lets parents and others acting 
in loco parentis (teachers, day care providers, etc.) block material that 
the children under their care are not ready for yet.  As a parent myself, I 
would really like this.

Governments, however, should not be in the business of deciding what 
material is suitable for whom.  By extension, the government should not 
restrict the flow of information at either the source (the content or 
Internet provider) or the sink (mandated "SOAP by the US Dept. of Education" 
on every browser that is child-accessible, anyone?); this is the job of the 
parent.

Yea Brandon!  We make multimedia authoring systems and would like
to incorporate some of these modules too.  We need HTTP transport and
a HTML parser.  We would like to license these modules but will probably
have to build them ourselves.  Modules are the way to go!

It would be nice to have a cross platform standard today but we don't.  Who
wants to work on a Windows OCX solution today?  CORBA and OpenDoc next
year?

Hi Rick,

The way this has been discussed on www-speed (and subsequently 
www-talk) is to add a HTTP header line "Pragma: Keep-connection" that 
basically works like:

Client Sends: 	GET /foo.html HTTP/1.0
		...
		Pragma: Keep-connection
		...

If the server supports the pragma and the item being requested has a 
known length, it includes the pragma in the reply:

Server Sends:	HTTP/1.0 200 OK
		...
		Pragma: Keep-connection
		...
		Content-length: 2048
		...

The server then optionally  keeps the connection open for x 
seconds/minutes waiting for the client to make the next request.  The 
pragma is only used on the first transaction.  The server is free to 
close the connection at the end of any request, which the client should 
accept as the end of data (as happens today).

The only tricky part for the client is a race condition between a 
client request and the server closing the connection (due to server 
load, timeout etc.).  In this case, the client just retries the request 
with the TCP session setup.

As you noted, in the cases where the content length is not known such 
as from server scripts, a packet approach would be nice.  My personal 
take is it's not worth it to modify HTTP/1.0 to support packets like 
this as that support is already speced for HTTP-NG.  Retrieving n files 
with known lengths is the most common case (i.e., a homepage with seven 
images) and is the most interesting one to optimize especially 
considering the trivial changes needed by the client and server.

Subject: i18n and Unicode/10646
content-length: 5674

I noticed that there has been some discussion here over the last few months
of using Unicode/ISO 10646 for internationalization of HTTP. I am
interested in use of Unicode/10646 on the Internet (all of Taligent's
software is based on Unicode), and so I've joined this list.

Gavin Nicol (gtn@ebt.com) recently proposed using Unicode as a kind of
character set "bus". Servers and clients would deal with their own, local
character sets, but by using Unicode for transmission, you get maximal
interoperability between a server and a client not using the same character
set.

Advantages I see:

1. Since there is complete round-trip mapping between Unicode and the
character sets in use today, a client and server using the same character
set should get the same result. Unicode has round trip mapping with all of
the ISO-8859-x sets, JIS 0208, JIS 0212, and KSC 5601. It also supports all
of the Big5 and GB character sets for Chinese, except for a handful of
variant forms of radicals which can be represented in Unicode/10646 in
other ways (I can get the details on this for anyone who is interested, but
Taligent's Chinese character set expert is out sick today).

2. Clients and servers using different character sets will get as much of
the text as possible. For example, a Japanese client reading from a server
using Greek will see the Greek, because JIS 0208 has the Greek character
set, and the mapping through Unicode will preserve it. If clients or
servers support more than one character set locally (some operating systems
allow this), they can try mapping to the primary character set first, then
try the others for characters which can't be mapped.

3. Clients or servers who use Unicode can interoperate with clients and
servers who don't.

The only disadvantage I see is how to enable such use of Unicode while
still supporting existing clients who don't understand it (the issue raised
by Sandra O'Donnell of OSF). In the absence of a character set negotiation
protocol in HTTP, it's not clear how to do this. It is certainly not the
case that everyone will switch to using Unicode this way overnight, so any
plan to enable use of Unicode has to make it optional.

I also wanted to respond to a couple of issues that were raised:

1. Using UTF-7 vs. UTF-8 vs. UCS-2 forms of Unicode: UTF-7 is a 7-bit code,
which you would really only want for mail and other channels where sending
8 bits is not safe. UTF-8 has the advantage that it looks like ASCII for
the first 128 octets, and so may work better with non-Unicode-aware
clients. It has the disadvantage that Asian characters take three bytes
each, a 50% increase in overhead over the encoding methods used now.
Straight Unicode results in no overhead for Asian users, but users of
8859-x will pay double overhead. Since it is very easy to mechanically
convert between UTF-8 and Unicode, if there were a character set
negotiation protocol, you could select the appropriate encoding based on
client preferences.

Another issue with using straight Unicode is that the MIME spec (at least,
the new draft version) specifies that all subtypes of the "text" content
type must use CRLF (0x0D 0x0A) line feed conventions, which rules out any
character set that does not use ASCII as a base, and certainly rules out a
16 bit character set like Unicode.

2. Han unification and language tagging: While tagging text with the
language will give a better presentation and aesthetics, it is not
necessary for basic legibility. Han unification in Unicode was performed in
such a way that characters were not unified if they had substantially
different appearances, or could be confused semantically (the Han
unification process is described in The Unicode Standard, Version 1.0,
Volume 2, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-60845-6. I strongly urge anyone who is
concerned about Han unification issues to read this and judge for
yourself).

Consider an example where this would be an issue. Suppose a Japanese user
receives some text which is in Chinese. Would language tagging help? There
are two cases:

a. The Japanese user does not have Chinese support on their system, only
Japanese. No Chinese fonts are installed. There are two options open:
translate the Unicode into JIS code and display it, or don't display
anything. The first option is preferable, because the text will be legible
even if not displayed in an ideal fashion.

b. The Japanese user does have Chinese support on their system, as well as
Chinese fonts. Here the issue is that because the "primary" character set
is Japanese, in the absence of language tagging the Unicode will be
converted to a Japanese character set and displayed in a Japanese font.
Thus, it would be desirable for language tagging to be supported in WWW
(and elsewhere on the Internet, for that matter). However, this situation
is not too bad, because:

- The text is still legible, as in a. above.
- The end user can specify that their preferred character set is Chinese,
and refetch the data.
- If the client system uses Unicode, they can just change the font to get
correct display.

Also note that this only occurs when the recipient has a multilingual,
multi-character set operating system with the right fonts installed. This
capability is still a rarity. In all other cases, the language tagging
won't make any difference in the end result.

In conclusion, I'm pretty familiar with Unicode but not very familiar with
HTTP and HTML. I am hoping to work together with the people on this list to
enable use of Unicode on WWW.

Perhaps you can be specific about draft states this. As far as I can
tell, the rule for "text" and end-of-line only are for those text
types that use charset=US-ASCII.

CRLF is defined elsewhere as being the exact octet sequence 0x0D 0x0A.

This was all discussed on the ietf-822 mailing list at some length, and the
consensus seemed to be that this was a necessary evil for compatibility
with existing software. I would have preferred a different approach, but
that's not how it turned out.

Hello,

Can anyone tell me where to find the source code for the WWW libaries that will
compile on PC's under DOS/Windows?

I would prefer something that can be compiled by Microsoft C or C++, but gcc
would be helpful as well.

Alternatively, do any PC (DOS/Windows) http servers come with source code? If
so, where can I get them?

Please either reply here on www-talk and/or at my e-mail address at:
anderson@jerry.cincom.com

Thanks in advance for any and all replies.

        Okay ... there's a new CMS (VM) HTTP server at

                http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~troth/rickvmsw/cmshttpd.vmarc
                http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~troth/rickvmsw/cmshttpd.tar

        This will probably be mirrored to

                ftp://ftp.rice.edu/pub/vm/cms/cmshttpd.vmarc
                ftp://ftp.rice.edu/pub/vm/cms/cmshttpd.tar

        but the cycle hasn't kicked-in.   Will check tomorrow (Wed).
("gosh! look at the time!";  oh well;  it's Wednesday already)   ;-)

        This release does not address two important issues:
filetype INDXHTML,  which has been requested to accompany FILELISTs,
and the use of alternative SFS Filepools for user web spaces.
Untested is a flag to disable user web spaces,  USERWEBS=OFF in the
config file.   Also,  it tries to address the security concerns
pointed out by Ross Patterson at Sterling.   (thanks, Ross!)   As with
any networking software,  be wary.   And finally,  it includes an IMAGEMAP
CGI script  (rect only;  more later).

As he said, it's in the latest draft version.  To be specific, it's section
6.1.1.1 of draft-ietf-822ext-mime-imb-01.

Yes.  But another, equally valid, point is that adults are not the

          you are correct. I am 15, and very much involved in the net,
          and contributing to it.  But I do feel that I can draw my
          own line on what I find acceptable and what I don't, and
          don't need somebody else telling me what to do (it's not a

But I do. I know that they will be completely unenfoceable but they will provide

1) The Manufactured Moral indignation brigade (Newt Gingrich & Co.). 
	Preemption is better than cure.

2) Won't be enforcable

3) Would be enforcable in a school type situation to stop classes of 5 year
	olds seeing wide-open-with-handcuffs.jpeg

4) Would protect people who run sites in certain situations

5) Would be usefull to be able to pre-select images to make sure that none
	fell bellow certain standards. IE don't want to have to bother with
	tame & lame gifs of only semi-naked people and concentrate only 
	on the ones of nubile young things being strapped to a UNIX box
	combined with large quantities of chockholate sauce.

IE it would be used for the same purpose as the X-Rated cinema - the directors
would go all out to get the strongest ratings possible. 

This is all forseen in J.S. Mill BTW

  You can do this with emacs and the package url.el.  The next major
release will have the ability to just do a 'find-file' on a URL and pop it
up in an editing buffer.  Once HTTP/1.0 has the proper stuff hammered into
it, you will be able to edit files on remote web servers using emacs.

  The url.el package will work under: Most flavors of unix, Windows
(3.1/3.11/NT/Chicago), OS/2 and the Amiga.

What has been the experience of people using the NT as an http server?  
What is the "best" http server software for a PC running Windows NT?  Any 
real-world experiences with the EMWACS server, specifically?

Indeed, we have much the same problem as HTML had before formalizing the 
DTD was pursued, which is "well that's how it looks in (Mosaic|Netscape)".
Simply asking that web browsers "conform" to the HTML 2.0 DTD and HTTP 
1.0 spec when it arrives isn't enough since there is more to it than 
that.  Many people mistakenly think that "you can only inline GIFs and 
XBMs in HTML, and NetScape's cool because it lets you do JPG too" - in 
fact the HTML DTD makes no such declarations.  Emacs-W3 lets you inline 
MPEG's after all! 

Forms is a tricky area that encompasses HTML, HTTP, and CGI (which also needs
a spec!) and URL's (due to METHOD=GET).  Since roughly all the same people
are involved in these areas it hasn't been a problem yet, but as we've seen,
it's not always easy to integrate the MIME-ness of HTTP with the SGML-ness of
HTML with the reserved-character restrictions of URL's with the
strightforwardness of CGI.  The way I see it, those four areas could pretty
much develop independently if there was a browser spec that essentially tied
them all together:  "the browser will represent form elements like THIS (HTML
issue), encode the results like THIS (CGI and URL issue), and transfer them
to the client like THIS (HTTP issue)".  All four elements should be 
coordinated to some extent, but what ties them together is the user-agent.

If you're referring to Larry Masinter's spec, the changes required to 
HTML were indeed rather minimal, but there were also changes required to 
the browser (he submittd diff's for XMosaic) and the server-side 
processing (he also submitted a CGI program to parse it).

I'd prefer they not be made optional, just like a MIME mail reader has to 
be able to display multipart data separately.  It's nontrivial to 
implement from scratch, but there are public-code implementations.

I'd be interested in taking this on, sure.

we've had a "little" experience w/ the emwac stuff :) - specifically, 
it runs www.microsoft.com on a dual pentium system back here (>100,000 
users/week). runs pretty solid and chris and co. at emwac have been 
really good abt feedback and fixes. they recently announced an 
arrangement w/ process software offer a commercial version of it w/ 
several planned enhancements. ameritech was demo'ing a commercial web 
server at internet world last week in beta, and i believe there is some 
work underway for a 32-bit port of ncsa's httpd to nt.

We use both lynx and WWW line mode:
	lynx -source http://abc.com/bar.gif >bar.gif
		and 
	www -n http://abc.com/bar.html >bar.html	

There is also a script called w3get that recursively gets URLs:
	http://www.stuff.com/~bcutter/home/programs/dist/w3get.txt

Hope this helps.

You might try telnet, we use it for testing.  Given a usl, say:
URL:http://void.nowhere.edu/goodies.html

> telnet void.nowhere.edu 80
Connected to void.nowhere.edu.
GET /goodies.html HTTP/1.0        <--- you enter this + CRLF, CRLF

I have been running HTTPS from EMWACS over NT 3.5 for about a month now.  
Solely for traffic from our private network users (low volume).  I have
exercised the support for WAIS searches.  

Overall, I've been quite impressed with the ease of installation and the
stability of the app though admittedly at low volume.  In terms of higher
volume applications, I think Microsoft is using it for their WWW presence
and (I think)
they provide some information about the platform their using and how many
transactions are occuring.  Check it out at http://www.microsoft.com.

What I don't know and would love others to comment on are the ease with
which CGI apps can be integrated?  What about any existing public domain
examples ?

... and with Python, you can use 'urllib' 

python /usr/local/lib/python/urllib.py  [ and one or more url's ] 

will write the sources to stdout.

Or use the functions in urllib to fetch them and do something 
else with them, like parse and fetch other referenced url's ( and
keep the ones already fetched in a dictionary, so you can check if
you've already retrieved it. )

There are two lists of HTML converters on the Web. These, I believe, 
also cover SGML.

We have been running the EMWAC for exactly a month today and are very 
satisfied. The down time has been about 1/2 hour when we upgraded from 0.94 
to 0.96 (0.96 solved a problem with down loading  files from Win Netscape 
0.9).

As James mentioned, Chris has been very helpful to us. We strongly recommend 
this fine NT software!

Thanks!

if you want the easiest possible server to install, login to your linux machine,
and point a browser at http://wsk.eit.com, and follow the steps.
Oh, BTW, thanks to everyone who answered my question about server platforms for 
running an http server.  We chose linux because of the fact that we can run it 
fast on cheaper machines, and the overwhelming support i got for it (i couldn't 
find a driver for my scsi card on my computer that i wanted to test linux on.  i
posted a message about it to comp.os.linux.development.  within 1 hour somebody 
(a person with experience with my scsi card, which was not exactly a common one)
wrote me a working driver, and had me up and running. All this on a sunday for 
free.  that's the kind of support you usually pay $1000's for)

It sounds like you want a client, not a server. Mosaic and Netscape
are both available already compiled for Linux as binaries on
sunsite.unc.edu.

We run the HTTPS server from EMWACS as well under NT 3.5.

We did a stress test of several NT machines running multiple copies of a
script aptly named hammer that was derived from our log file. Average file
size was 5K.

Our 486-66 w/ 32Meg sustained 12 hits/second

Our load is currently in the 20K hits/day range, with no problems from the
server.

Anyone interested in sharing utilities let me know.

We've been using the EMWAC HTTPS for nearly six months now, lately on 
Windows 3.5.  We host various project home pages, including the Comms & 
Telecoms VL.  We get a total of approx 5000 hits per day.  The server (v0.6) 
has crashed precisly once in all that time.  We have had no trouble at all 
with the latest version.

Chris Adie has always been very prompt to discuss any minor problems that 
have arisen.  Most of these were performance issues with CGI scripts, and 
again I am happy to say that the latest version handles all our forms-based 
stuff very nicely.

I'm making a MOSAIC home page and want to use a ray-traces image of 
a sphere for my bullet marker. Is there anyway to change the default
white blob used on lists to my own image?

There's a new mailing list, WWW@Unicode.Org, which has been created
for indepth technical discussions of the possibility of modifying the
WWW protocols to support Unicode. It is going along the same lines as
some of the Unicode discussions on WWW-Talk, just a more focused
group with no other WWW issues. 

If interested in joining this mailing list, send email to WWW@Unicode.Org
with a subject line of SUBSCRIBE, and a message body of "subscribe 
www@unicode.org <your name>", i.e.:

    To: WWW@Unicode.Org
    Subject: SUBSCRIBE

    subscribe www@unicode.org <Your Name>

Unfortunately, the mailing list software is not automated, but a human 
will filter out and handle the subscription requests...

Executive summary:

	Preliminary results show that Netscape aborts 8 times as many
	connections as NCSA Mosaic, and that  nearly a quarter of all 
	Netscape conceptions result in abortion.

-----	
A while ago I posted a message to www-talk describing problems caused by
aborted connections, and the difficulties involved in getting reliable 
statistics on how often this problem was occuring.

Because it's so hard to gather these statistics through existing logs, 
I made some minor modifications to tcpdump to add some HTTP 1.0 protocol
analysis, and ran a trace on all http traffic going over the primary 
sunsite network. I only ran the trace for a relatively short period of time;
I'll be running a longer trace later this week. A brief analysis of the data
did yield some extremely interesting results. 

I classified an aborted transaction as one in which the client sends a packet
containing a RST flag, and a successful transaction as one where the client
sends a packet containing a FIN flag. 

The two most common clients as identified by a User-Agent flag in the HTTP
header were Mosaic (NCSA), and Mozilla(Netscape). 

RESULTS:

Browser		LIVE BIRTHS	ABORTIONS	TOTAL	ABORTION %age
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NCSA Mosaic	1,194		36		1,230		 3%
Mozilla		1,004		313		1,317		24%

Well.....I think someone just won the "most eye-catching Subject: line
of the year" award!

I don't think the above statistic is so shocking.......and I think
that your opinion of how bad it is depends upon your perspective.

>From a server perspective, these truncated connections are bad.  From
a client perspective, they are probably good, since they mean that
(possily limited) bandwidth and rendering time is not wasted on
something I don't care about.

One of the prime advantages of NetScape as a general "Surfing" tool is
the ability to navigate off of pages before everything has loaded.
This is important both with long pages (eg the old NCSA "What's New")
where you have a hotlink at the top and don't want to wait for the
bottom to appear, or when you stumble across a page with an inlined
megabyte of worthless GIF.  Should the user be held captive while the
image transfers to save the server the abort, or should the user be
able to navigate around the image, saving significant time on his/her
14.4K link?

Are we looking at some sort of "I no longer care about this data"
message from client to server that can be used to stop a pipe?  This
kid of "clean" shutdown might be a little cleaner on the client side,
and certainly on the server side.  If the client could (during a
transmission) send some sort of urgent data to the server telling it
to stop sending, that might solve the client's need to save bandwidth
without hitting the server too hard.

Another feature for HTTP-IV? :-)

I am committed to writing such modules for parsing/displaying HTML 3.0
and making them available as part of the W3O library. We will be including
support for style sheets.

Brilliant.  Ive never used the W3O library - I've only just gotten to grips
with perl.  Will the library be available only in c or will perl be
represented as well?

	Yes!   I see that several have been mentioned. 
 
	This is exactly what  'webcat'  is for.   Syntax is 
 
		webcat [-i | -a]  URL 
 
	where URL is the Uniform Resource Locator of the 
object to be retrieved.   The UNIX version will canonicalize 
plain text or image.   (other canonicalizations are possible 
on other platforms,  but there doesn't seem to be much agreement 
about how to send that over TCP) 
 
>      There must have been something like that already developed and I

	I would have hoped that something like webcat would be the 
basic building block for a wide range of pipelined WWW applications. 
It's just a slap-together thing now.   I wanted to use the CERN 
library,  but the learning curve on that was too steep for the 
time I had available. 
 
	Webcat has one interesting feature that I *really* like 
to which some have objected.   The URL can be a local file. 
If the URL is a local file,  and that local file is a sym-link 
that fails to resolve locally,  the link is used as the URL. 
What happens is that system open() is called first,  iff that fails 
then webcat tries a readlink(),  iff that succeeds then webcat uses 
the link reference as a URL,  if neither open() nor readlink() work 
then webcat treats the command-line argument as the URL. 
 
	This means you can 
 
		ls -l http://www.cern.ch/ CERN 
 
	and then later 
 
		webcat -a CERN | your_favourite_browser

Look at the EIT site for a program called getstats.  Getstats will perform a

   Does anybody know of some statistics (unix) tools, well suited to
   work on the access_log file that NCSA's httpd creates ?

Roy Fielding's wwwstat program is in use at a lot of sites, including
here; see

  http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/wwwstat/

The only problem I've had with it is that it produces too much
information to peruse on a daily basis (wwwstat summaries are still
pretty big).

I finally wrote a program of my own which takes the wwwstat summary,
and produces a two-page metasummary whose major content is a breakdown
of traffic by directory (cumulative over subdirectories), with traffic
in images broken out from other files (to give some idea how much
traffic comes from inline images), and with low-traffic directories
suppressed.  This is a perl5 script; see

  http://www.ai.mit.edu/tools/usum/usum.html

for pointers to a sample of the output, and a copy of the script, if
you're interested.

Isn't this written for the NCSA httpd?  Will it work with CERN's?  If
not, any similar programs for the CERN httpd logs?

They currently use the same log format.

We use wwwstat on our NCSA server also, but would really prefer graphical
output to display to the general users.  Does anyone know of such
a tool to generate graphs either from the access log or from the
wwwstat output?

Nice script, I may use it to display reports to our users.

[This message is converted from WPS-PLUS to ASCII]

When dynamically producing pages with <IMG SRC=...> tags, we've run into a 
need to convert images from various formats (particularly JPEG) into GIF on 
the fly.  A utility callable from a CGI script (Tcl running on Solaris) 
would be ideal.  Surely the Unix world already has such and we don't have 
to code this from scratch?  Not sure where we'd get the formats anyway... 

Any pointers, ideas appreciated!

Hi there

I'm trying to make a multi option image, or a so called image
map. Can anybydy help me. 

I've been viewing sourcecodes from multiple places including Time
and Internet Shopping Network, but the sourcecodes only displays
a regular anchor. 

How do I create .cgi files?
Where do I get information and documentation on creating this
feature?

I need to create app. 10 choises in one image.

Thanks so much in advance.

Please answer directly to: jbb@dtv.dk

  You can use the JPEG-v5 and NETPBM utilities to do this, but I imagine
there is probably a faster way.  Something like this:

#!/bin/sh
echo 'Content-Type: image/gif'
echo 
djpeg [any options] filename | ppmtogif

  Unfortunately, this won't give you a content-length, but oh well. :)

This sounds like the textual material is created dynamically but the JPEGs 
and GIFs are essentially static. Is that correct?

I would hesitate to call it ideal. The last modify date will always be *now* 
which defeats sensible proxy cacheing, and you do the same conversion over 
and over for highly-cited images.

At least cache them!

I would have though a better way would be to use find on your server docroot
and for each jpeg, if there is no gif with the same basename or the 
corresponding GIF is older, convert it.

Run this in a cron job every day/week/hour depending on how dynamic your 
web publishing is. 

Also, several browsers either support inline JPEG (Chimera, Netscape) or 
have stated that they will do so in the future (Arena) so leaving the 
files as JPEGs might be an option.

Oh, gross ;-)

At least make it check for an existing conversion, if not, convert it and 
store it. Then you get a content length and a speed improvement, too.

I have used gnuplot with term set to 'ppm' and then used netpbm to
convert from ppm to gif. ( Not for log statistics, but for other
on the fly graphics - we're trying to use WWW internally for 
experiment logs. ) I only wish I had the time to add a gif driver
directly to gnuplot. Anyone have any better solutions ?

I would add a ppmquant to that pipeline. Keeping it down to 16 colours
seems a good compromise for small pictures. You will have to try a bit
to find an acceptable number of colours for your application, but
remember that many browsers can't show more than 50 colours pr. Web
document.

   Isn't this written for the NCSA httpd?  Will it work with CERN's?  If
   not, any similar programs for the CERN httpd logs?

   Bryon Propst

The latest version of wwwstat handles Common Log Format, so it ought
to work just fine with CERN.  Incidentally, there is a page of
pointers to server-statistical tools at Yahoo (there's a page of
pointers to *everything* at Yahoo), including a graphical back-end to
wwwstat (gwstat), at

   http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Computers/World_Wide_Web/HTTP/Servers/Log_Analysis_Tools/

It includes pointers to every tool I've seen mentioned here (how'd my
thing get in there?) and some others.

gwstat <URL:http://dis.cs.umass.edu/stats/gwstat.html> uses the
output from wwwstat to generate a series of graphs.  It requires a
few hefty application to generate the images but they *are* rather
nice.


By the way, wwwstat is hard coded to use the NCSA server
configuration files (even though it reads the common log format), but
can be tweaked to read the CERN files.  I can mail diffs for our
installation if you would like.

Metaverse is Back!

The Metaverse has been back up now for a couple of months and has been
remarkably stable.  It's been crash-free all fall, and recently went almost
two months without interruption.  (We had to shut it down briefly at that
point to see if it there had been any memory leaks.  If we hadn't, from what
we can see, it would be past two months and running fine.)

Now all we need is to get all our programmers back.  There are a lot of
characters out there who haven't been used in months and lots of junk
cluttering up the db.  We want to rejuvenate the MOO and get people back
on.  In order to help clean up older accounts within Metaverse, we plan
to start dropping inactive accounts on Jan 1.  If you have an account
on Metaverse and have not been back in a long time...now is the time to
return!  Also, old, unread mail will be deleted at some point in the
near future.  No need to worry, we will give plenty of warning before
toasting your old mail... you can use our new @email command to forward
any old MOOmail to your email box, and save it there.

Jay is working on an off-MOO text object (Yeah, yeah, that's been in
progress for years, it seems, but we really mean it, this time...) and
we've got a new wizard, Kira, who's been busy.  Cruella is another
wizard who has been around and has been busy as well.  There are a lot
of new features.  Events will be planned.  Check out the MOO and
io.metaverse for info on what's going on.

Hope to see you soon!

There is no HTML to PS software.  It's your job to create it.  Mosaic
and Netscape have internal routines to do this, but they are not
accessible to you.  You can use them as examples of (more or less)
what needs to be done, but I hope you'll do better than they do.

The "enscript" program translates from ASCII to PS, you can use it
as an example also.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: html2ps, an HTML-to-PostScript converter
Date: 12 Dec 1994 08:38:52 GMT

Version 0.1 beta of html2ps, an HTML-to-PostScript converter, is now
available as "ftp://ftp.tdb.uu.se/pub/sources/html2ps/html2ps_0.1beta.tar".
You can also fetch the individual (four) files from the same directory.
Use binary mode when retrieving the files. The converter is written in
Perl. Perl is available from any comp.sources.misc archive.

First of all: html2ps cannot handle in-line images.

Are you still reading!? Well then, here are some features extracted from
the README file:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Most HTML tags are handled.

  * Scaling of the text to any size is possible (the line and page breaks
    will off course be adjusted to fit the page).

  * It is possible to change the sizes and styles for all the 6 header
    levels individually.

  * The font size used for preformatted text may be changed.

  * The size of the page can be adjusted. The defaults are adapted to the
    A4 paper size.

  * The margin sizes may be changed.

  * Different fonts can be selected. You can easily add new fonts, an
    example is given in the Perl script.

  * Printing in landscape mode is supported.

  * Anchor texts are underlined by default, this can be turned off.

  * No syntax check of the HTML code is done by the converter, but it is
    possible to call an external HTML checker, specified via the command
    line options. The default syntax checker is weblint.

  * Page numbers can be inserted.

  * A heading tag will cause a page break if the text is close to the end
    of a page.

  * Highlighting tags is additively interpreted. For example, the HTML
    code "<B><I>some text</I></B>" would produce bold italic text.
    This can be turned off so only the innermost tag is interpreted
    (here, the italics).

  * You can force a page break by including the comment <!--NewPage-->
    in the HTML document, at the point you want the page break. (This
    action is not defined in the HTML specification. I would like to
    have a special character (eg &page;), ignored by screen browsers,
    but used to force a page break when printing a document.)

  * The generated PostScript code is very compact, it will be less than
    the size of the HTML file plus the size of a PostScript header
    (presently about 8 kilobytes).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The converter is not as kind as certain browsers towards incorrect
HTML code. For example, Mosaic writes "&lt" as "<", even though the
trailing semicolon is missing.

The Perl script has been tested with Perl 4 and 5 on different Suns
running Solaris 2.3 and SunOS 4.1.3. I would like to hear your
experiences with installing html2ps on other platforms.

I am also very interested in getting suggestions for improvements and
bug reports.

Actually, having just "&lt" is legal SGML.  The name of an entity
reference can be explicitly terminated by a ';' or implicitly
terminated when a non-name character is encountered.

Examples:

	<p> 5 &lt 6

    Is legal.  However,

	<p> The &ltp&gt tag denotes paragraphs.

    is legal, but will not give you the proper results.  The parser
    will see the entity reference "ltp".  This will lead to an
    undefined entity reference (unless "ltp" is defined).

With all that said, one should use the ';' to delimit entity references.
It makes life easier for developers of HTML based applications.

Try:

http://stasi.bradley.edu/ftp/pub/ps2html/home.html 

I haven't it, and I think it makes no real attempt to preserve formatting.

For a nice list of converters take a look at:
        http://oneworld.wa.com/htmldev/devpage/dev-page2.html#doc-f
        http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/www/html/converters.html

Hope this helps...

As if it were reasonable to expect a browser to swallow legal HTML.
Many have problems if you just fail to omit all the tags.

I'd be interested in any browser that properly displayed all of
http://www.phone.net/~mwm/browserbuster.html . It validates under the
11/15 HTML 2.0 DTD, even with HTML.Recommended turned on. I've as yet
to find a browser that can deal with the second paragraph in it
properly.

It also makes it more likely that your documents will display

What am I missing here?  Certainly a return like the above would cause
me to rework the document.

As far as I can tell, most documents on the Web can't pass the current
DTD, not to mention when sgmls is set to ``recommended.''  And this
certainly goes for documents prepared using an HTML authoring editor.

Seems kinda sad, and most of the docs that do not pass can be easily
fixed without changing the page appearance, so perhaps the problem lies
either in carelessness or ignorance.  It does seem, though, that most
writers of HTML docs really don't care as long as the page looks okay
in Mosaic and NetScape.

Well, it says that it couldn't find the DTD for HTML. I would expect
pretty much everything to fail after that. Since I did something
unusual for the WWW, and included the <!DOCTYPE to fetch the HTML
public DTD, I have to assume your sgml system isn't configured
properly (or mine isn't).

There are two issues involved here. One is that a web browser fetches
only one entity. The only way for that single entity to validate under
sgml is for it to include the HTML decleration and DTD, which you
really don't want to include in every document you send over the wire
(the DTD is noticably larger than most HTML pages).

The other is that the document type is known to be HTML, so many
people don't even bother with the DOCTYPE statement.

My solution is a Rexx script that checks for the DOCTYPE, adds it if
it isn't there, and feeds the HTML decleration to sgmls before the
document.  Basically, I treat the HTML document as an entity that's
expected to include only the instance. There might be a better way to
do this, but it does work.

BTW, I realized a word was left out of the original post; the first
line should have been:

As if it were reasonable to expect a browser to swallow all legal HTML.

Mike,

I used the HaLsoft Validation service and just fed the URL into it,
which was the way I figured you would want to have it parsed.

When I changed the <!DOCTYPE to:

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">

it parsed okay.  <gag!>  Live and learn.  This presents a real
interesting problem, and it looks as though a bit of work needs to be
done.

It seems the following is how DOCTYPE is currently being used for 2.0:


      PUBLIC  "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN"          html.dtd
      PUBLIC  "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"         html.dtd
      PUBLIC  "-//IETF//DTD HTML Level 2//EN"      html.dtd
      PUBLIC  "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0 Level 2//EN" html.dtd

Regards...
Fred

			WN -- a server for the HTTP
		Version 0.94 (beta) now available at
		ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/wn/wn.tar.gz

	An HTTP server should do more than just serve files.
	It should play an active role in both navigation and
	presentation issues.  It is my hope that this server
	provides better tools for the creative webmaster.

WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  It runs
on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and is available at no cost for
any use under the terms of the GNU public license.

The design of WN is based on the use of a small flat database in each
directory with information about the files in that directory.
Fields associated with a file include its title, and may include
keywords, expiration date and any user defined fields like author or
document id.

See an overview at
	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/overview.html

or the entire User's Guide at
	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/manual.html

To see a few of the things this server can do that most others can't
check out the context search of the HTML 2.0 specification and the
index to the same document, both at

	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/html2.0/index.html

Features of WN:

	o A variety of built-in searches including title searches,
	  keyword searches, or fielded searches for user defined fields.
	  These can be done across the entire server or any subhierarchy.

	o Builtin full text searching of text documents in a single 
	  directory.  This is intended to provide a mechanism for users
	  to search a single logical HTML document which may consist of
	  many files on the server.

	o Support for "Keywords:" and "Expires:" HTTP headers, either
	  via the <meta> element in HTML documents or by entering these
          fields in the data base.

	o Secure server side includes and wrappers for documents.

	o Security based on per directory databases.  Only files with entries
	  in databases may be served.

	o Filters.  An arbitrary filter may be assigned to any document
	  to process that document on the fly when serving it.

	o CGI 1.1 support for forms, clickable images etc.  CGI scripts
	  can be in any directory.  Their execution can be restricted
	  by requiring a specific user or group id for the database 
	  referring to them.

	o Ranges. Support for URLs which return only a specified byte
	  or line range of a document.  This is useful for structured
	  files.

	o Password authentication (basic type)

	o Over 100K of documentation.

WN's functionality was planned with a focus on serving HTML documents.
This means such things as enabling full text searching of a single
logical HTML document which may consist of many files on the server,
or allowing users users to search all titles on the server and obtain
a menu of matching items, or allowing users to download a total
logical document for printing even though the document consists of
many linked files on the server.  All of these are done in a way which
is transparent to the user (and largely transparent to the maintainer!)
The User's Guide at <http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/manual.html">
provides a good example of both of these. But these are only examples of 
many new tools WN makes available to webmasters.

Stop right there :-)

If sgmls can't find the DTD, don't expect much else to work.

You need to set up a catalog file (or if you've got
a pre-1.1.91 version of sgmls, set $SGML_PATH (shudder)
correctly).

You also need to supply the SGML declaration for HTML
on the command line.  Get html.decl from 

    <URL:http://www.hal.com/~connolly/html-spec/html-pubtext.html>
    (a catalog file and the HTML DTD(s) are there too)

and run

	sgmls html.decl browserbuster.html

It parses fine.

I came across an Inline Images FAQ that might be of use to you. It 
covers such things as inline images vs. external viewers, colour 
mapping, GIFs and JPEGs, browser capabilities, image manipulation tools, 
and tips and tricks.

The FAQ is posted to the following newsgroups:

comp.infosystems.www.providers, comp.infosystems.www.users, 
alt.graphics.pixutils and comp.graphics

and is maintained by Brian Patrick Lee (blee@media-lab.media.mit.edu)

I hope this helps.

Regards,

Cecilia

I'm going through the SHTTP fyi 6/94 and the referenced rfc's. Has anybody
reduced SHTTP down to pseudo-code 'paint-by-the-numbers' yet? I want to 
incorporate SHTTP capability into my server code and I'd appreciate any pointers
to additional information anyone is kind enough to offer.

Ummmmmm, perhaps you should place a few more restrictions on what
you are looking for.  My conservative estimate is that there are currently
at least 1 million different URLs out there right now (and that's just HTTP),
and it'll probably be 2 million by June (end of the school year).
My site alone has 2168 unique URLs reachable from server root (not including
many private sub-webs).

Even if you cut it down to just "the top of distinct infostructures",
you are still looking at a minimum of 50,000 (5/server on avg) and
more likely 200,000.

If you want a quick start on what URLs are worth following, see Yahoo
<http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/> which currently contains 22,837
entries.

I recently put up a copy of the HTML 2.0 draft specification as a demo
for one of the nice features of the new WN server.  It occurred to me
that many people who aren't interested in WN might be interested in
access to a searchable version of the spec, so I am publicizing it
here.

There are two things you might find useful about this that I haven't
found available at other sites.  First there is what I consider a very
nice full text regular expression search at 

	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/html2.0/dosearch.html

and there is an index of over 1100 words and phrases which occur in the
39 HTML files of the spec with links that will take you to the proper
location in the text.  This can be found at

	http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/html2.0/docindex.html


If you just want to view the specification from the top  try

For me it is a combination of ignorance and lack of time.  When I first
started writing HTML, the CERN documentation said nothing about header
information.  Then someone passing themselves as authoritative said "use
<!DOCTYPE...>", then someone else passing themselves off as
authoritative said "use <HTML>" at the start of your documents, then
people started talking about <HEADER> and <BODY>, then people just
started arguing.  I gave up at this point.  My intention was that when
everybody got around to stop arguing about DTDs and Mosaic, I would have
another look at it, and figure out what the "correct" way to do things
really was, and change my documents and programs.  I never really got
around to it, though.

I have no problem writing correct documents, and I fully intend to
give sgmls another go, but so much contradictory and confusing
information has been flying around (and STILL IS) that it's not a
trivial thing to figure out what is "correct".

As a user of many different browsers, a writer of a reasonable amount
of HTML, and a author of several HTML generation/conversion utilities.
I do _want_ to get it right.

<!DocType ..> is going to be very important.  As we begin to serve
arbitrary SGML instances over WWW, it will help to know what it is :)

*For Now*, we can get away with the peek at the first # chars, insert
<!DocType HTML...> if not present.

I recommend we all start/continue using <!DocType ...>.

The S-HTTP specification of 6/94 (describing version 1.0 of the protocol)
has been superceeded by a spec released this month describing version 1.1.
It has been published as an Internet Draft "draft-rescorla-shttp-00.txt",
available in the usual places. You can always find the latest version at
"http://www.commerce.net/information/standards/drafts/shttp.txt".

We haven't gotten it down to the "Cliff Notes" description yet, but you may
find the new spec more readable. Any suggestions on how to improve the spec
is welcomed.

You might want to subscribe to the following mailing lists:
        www-security@ns1.rutgers.edu
        shttp-talk@openmarket.com
for information and discussions about securing WWW transactions.

We can't until a standard exist with a doctype in it (I've been
using various recommended doctypes that were later changed, it's
a pain). So let's hope the RFC makes it RSN...

     ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
and 
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

and will eventually be available at an IETF shadow directory near you.

It includes roughly 60% of the changes requested from draft 00 -- we would

A couple of questions and comments on the new HTTP/1.0 spec...

(1)  In the definition of the Accept request header, there is no  
mention of a "version" modifier, e.g.,

	Accept: text/html; version=3.0

This would seem like the right way to determine HTML client  
capabilities.  Going by the User-Agent field is a real quagmire.

(2)  The semantics of Expires should discourage clients from  
_indiscriminately_ trying to refetch objects, just because they have  
expired.  Dynamically-created pages can be ephemeral, without having  
time-dependent content that needs to be updated.

For example, the Geometry Center interactive gallery generates  
dynamic graphical HTML pages customized to each user's request.  The  
user's images are deleted at the same moment they are fetched, and so  
the document ceases to exist on the server the moment it is  
retrieved.  Therefore, the gallery expires all documents immediately:

	Expires: Sun, 01 Jan 0000 00:00:00 GMT

Nevertheless, it would not make sense to try to fetch an "updated"  
version of such a document.

I have an NCSA httpd server running on my machine
I would like to know if there is a way for the server, to identify a given
"session" in Mosaic. Something that would be similar to the username-password authentication
scheme that exists under Mosaic ,in a given session you are only once asked the password,username
for a given directory. This could be used  for instance, to ask only once in a "Mosaic session"
some information to the user.

I think this is really a confusion about what 'Expires' means. Some people seem
to use it to mean that the information is no longer valid. So, for example, a 
price list or commercial quote might have a 30 day expiry - after that, the 
prices will be different.

Some people use it to mean the information on the server has changed.

I prefer the first, user-perspective view of expires.

For example, a gif of todays weather might expire at midnight. It is not valid 
after midnight, because it is then yesterdays weather! Now, it could well be 
that the server will have a new gif after midnight. Then again, it might not -
but the old gif is still invalid irrespective of what the server does.

But it is still valid for the user that fetched it.

I am not sure that this is wise. It is using the server-view of expires 
rather than the user view.

As you say, this view causes problems. I suggest thinking of the Expires:
header as meaning "a cache can validly serve this file on request until:"

I've been putting together a CGI Programmer's Reference at 
<URL:http://www.halcyon.com/hedlund/cgi-faq/>.  As part of the project, 
I've been collecting information on characteristics of various browsers; 
specifically, the environment variables they pass to CGI scripts.  I have 
one CGI script that figures out if I've heard from the user's browser, 
and if not, allows them to submit a form to another script, which mails 
me a list of the environment variables it receives.  The form, using 
"method='post'" contains one input tag, which asks for the email address 
of the submitter.

On two occasions now, I've gotten a response that lists REQUEST_METHOD = 
GET, with the user's email address in QUERY_STRING.  In both cases, 
HTTP_USER_AGENT has indicated that the submitter was working through a 
proxy.  Is there any reason why a proxy would convert "method='post'" to 
"mathod='get'"?

The browsers and proxies were:
	* ATSON-W3LM/1.0-beta libwww/2.17+cocoa modified  via proxy 
	  gateway CERN-HTTPD/3.0 libwww/2.17
	* NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System/2.4 libwww/2.12 modified  
	  via proxy gateway CERN-HTTPD/3.0pre6 libwww/2.16 beta

Thanks for your help.

You're right.  "Expires" should refer to the client's view of things.
I'll correct the programs.

(One thing that clients and proxies do need to be careful of is to use
caching only for the idempotent HTTP methods, in particular never for
POST, unless they know that the request body is exactly the same too.)

I think I was confused by the usage of some of the terms in the spec.
To say that data obtained on the Web is "invalid" should mean that the
association between the data and the URI used to retrieve it has been
broken.  But this may happen either because the URI has new data, or
because it has become defunct and has _no_ data.  "Expires" really only
covers the first case, and the spec should make that clear.

Similarly, a "dynamic" URI, I'd think, would be one which produces
non-constant data.  But again, there are two ways this can happen.
One is that the URI is actually serving _time-dependent_ data; the
other is that the URI may be accessed with by HTTP method like POST,
which accepts a variable request body that affects the output.
The spec's "strong encouragement" to authors of dynamic documents
is really directed towards authors of time-dependent documents.

Arbitrary SGML documents will probably carry a content type of text/sgml;
not text/html in any case.  Full SGML conformance, proper reference to DTDs,
proper distribution of arbitrary DTDs, it can be done without loading it all
onto the poor mistreated workinghorse of HTML.

Proxy definitely never changes the request method.  This is because
some clients don't use POST correctly when reloading the page, but use
GET instead; NCSA Mosaic definitely has this bug, and probably also
the ATSON client:

Generally: I'm looking for detailed information on how CGI works.  I 
remember reading it online a long time ago, so just a URL to the right 
place would be helpful.

Specifically: I'm trying to figure out how to make a CGI script return a 
specific error such as 401 - Unauthorized. Can anyone tell me where TFM 
is to Read?   Thanks el buncho!   --Darren

In your message of Nov 20th about HTTP-NG, you described
SCP, a session control protocol, which supports multiple
conversations over a single TCP connection.

Before standardizing a new protocol in this area, you
may want to take a good look at the ICE protocol and
the ICElib library for it, which is part of X11R6,
and which was released this past summer.

ICE also supports multiple conversations over a single
connection, with support for separate authentication
of each conversation.  ICE is designed to be
used over TCP or any other reliable connection-oriented
transport.  ICElib is thread-safe and can be used in either
a single or multi-thread environment.

A great deal of design work and testing went into ICE,
both as part of the X Consortium review process, and
as a result of using it to implement the X Session
Management protocol and library.

The best contact for more information is Ralph Mor
at the X Consortium, mor@x.org

I was just looking over your WWW Applets material
and wanted to let you know of some work we've done at
OSF in the context of X that is relevant.
 
I agree with you that the overall browser framework
needs to support (at least as an option) viewers and
user accessories which are placed within the main browser.

The main issue in supporting embedding is the protocol
used for commnication between the parent and child applications --
among other things, this needs to support negotiation about
window placement, color, resources, transfers of focus,
propogation of inputs, support for dialogue windows,
and menu integration.

In the Windows world, OLE 2 supports this ability;
on the Mac, Apple will provide OpenDoc;
on X platforms, the winner is still unclear.

If you want to take a look at the way embedding needs
to be dealt with in the X environment, you might be
interested in the work done by Jan Newmarch, from the
University of Canberra, when he took his sabbatical at OSF.
Jan built an embedding protocol on top of ICE, a virtual
message protocol layered over TCP, and released as part
of X11R6.  The code plus demos is available from Jan 
(jan@ise.canberra.edu.au), and possibly may be available
from the contrib area of the X Consortium.

Jan will be giving a talk at the upcoming X Conference
(Jan 30-Feb 1 in Boston) about this work.

----------
 
On the issue of filters -- as you note, one of the main
problems is characterizing the degradation factor
in translating from one format to another.

You might want to take a look at my article in Issue 5
of the X Resource, based on the talk I gave at the 1993
X Conference, on Describing Formats for X-based Data
Interchange.

It deals (among other things) with the more general problem of
characterizing the information carried in a selected part of a
document, and is a good starting place for dealing with
degradation issues as well.

A couple approaches that I've seen used are:

 1) Make each document an automatically-generated FORM,
    and embed the session id in an <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN>.

 2) Embed the session id in the URL as a prefix, and use only
    relative URLs in all the served documents.  The initial
    URL might be something like:

	http://www.foocom.com/cgi-bin/session/

    and all subsequent URLs would look like:
	
	http://www.foocom.com/cgi-bin/session/ID001942/Top.html

Another approach, which I'm going to try sometime, is to:

 3) have httpd fork, allocate a new TCP port, and listen for requests 
    on that port in "standalone" mode for the lifetime of the session:

	http://www.foocom.com:9021/Top.html

    Again, all local URLs in served documents must be relative,
    so the browser uses  the right HTTP port number for
    subsequent requests.

None of these schemes are directly supported by NCSA httpd;
you'll need to write some CGI scripts or hack the server in 
each case.  (2) seems like the easiest way to go.

One way might be to use the Authorization: field to carry session info -
the idea being to require authorization, but to allow any arbitrary user
access, and just use the returned Authorization: as a session id. 

To support authorization (at least, to support it without constantly asking
for passwords again and again) the clients keep the authorization info for
each page. The question is whether this is hierarchical or not - once you
have an authorization for a root page, are clients in fact smart enough 
to use that string for other transactions to other URL's below that root ? 

[ From casual outside observation of clients actions, I *think* that is 
  the case, but I haven't really tested it. ] 


However, although you're relying on the client support for authorization,
you have to "roll your own" authorization on the server in your CGI's. 
They have to demand authorization, but accept anything, and use that 
returned string as the "session id".

Thanks to the people who responded about CGI docs.
The answer as to where they are is 
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu

The answer for causing a CGI script to make NCSA HTTPD1.3 output an error 
with additional headers is writing the following to stdout. (Evidently, 
starting your output with HTTP/1.0 isn't sufficient, in spite of my 
interpretation of the documents. YMMV.)

Status: 599 Wierdness probably required.
Another: header
Content-type: text/plain

This should appear in the body of your message.


Again, thanks for the instant help!  Ain't the net cool?  ;-)  --Darren

Mosaic(TM) for Microsoft Windows Version 2.0alpha8 is available on NCSA's
ftp server, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  NCSA Mosaic is a network navigational tool 
that will allow you to access networked information with the click of a mouse
button.  Mosaic is capable of accessing data via protocols such as HTTP, 
Gopher, FTP and NNTP (Usenet News) natively, and other data services such as 
Archie, WAIS, and Veronica through gateways.  NCSA Mosaic was designed to 
provide its user transparent access to these information sources and 
services.  Mosaic is copyrighted by the University of Illinois.  However,
is available at no cost to individual users, Academic organizations, 
Government organizations and for internal business use.  If you plan to 
redistribute Mosaic or profit from the use of Mosaic, you should contact
NCSA for licensing information. (mosaic@ncsa.uiuc.edu)

With our latest compile we have created a native version of Mosaic for the 
iX86, Mips, DEC and PPC processors.   Below are the naming schemes we will 
be using for this release.

	axp.mosaic.2.0.0a8.exe         NT for the DEC aXP
       	mips.mosaic.2.0.0a8.exe        NT for the MipsPC
       	ppc.Mosaic.2.0.0a8.exe         NT for the Power PC

Unfortunately, the ppc version of A8 will be delayed until we get over
our old compilier blues.

and WfW, you will need to obtain a 1.1 compliant winsock application.

If you are running a commercial TCP/IP stack, such as FTP Software, Novell, 
PCNFS, etc., you will need to obtain that vendors winsock.dll.  If you don't
have commercial networking software and need a winsock.dll, you are welcome
to try the shareware product called the "Trumpet Software International 
Winsock".  You can find the latest version of this software at the anonymous
ftp site: ftp.utas.edu.au.  Check the /pc/trumpet/winsock directory for the
latest version.

This implies that reloading a page should POST the original data again:
not such a great idea if a user has just submitted an order and ends up
making several identical orders.  

The HTTP spec gives a number of example uses for the POST method including
annotation, posting a message, submitting a block of data - things you
would only want to do once.   Usually the method=GET is used when you
don't mind having the same thing submitted multiple times with a reload.

It isn't in any specs, so what is the expected action?

	Do a GET on the same URL? (broken browsers do this now)
	Disable the ability to Reload the page?
	Ask the user if they want to resubmit the POST? (Netscape now does)
	Resubmit the Post anyway? (Netscape used to)

In the latter case sites that accept forms will have to watch out for
identical copies or implement some hidden session numbers.
