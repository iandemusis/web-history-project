Hello, 

Is it still April 1 in the United States?  
INTERNET VIRUS ALERT is really enjoyable (^^), and it's time 
to go back to www-talking.

March 31 is already over anywhere, and some of we need to 
re-download newer version of Netscape, to be expired June 30, 
and need to go to the "user anonymous access denied" jams.  

I don't understand why we have to update Netscape too often. 
Is there a necessity to do so? 
(But I love Netscape because it supports Japanese character 
 encodings originally. NCSA Mosaic is nearly useless to 
 browse Japanese sites.)  

Does anyone know if we have a better hope??  
Any pointer (not poison) is appreciated. 

regards, 

Hiroshi MURATA.

Joe English said (with regard to MetaMAP's patent):

I think that's slightly wrong.  The IETF (and W3O?) can standardize
patented technology, provided anyone can license the technology under
"reasonable" terms.  That said, folks often prefer public domain
technology over licensed technology exactly because they have a freer
hand with it.

This has been asked before, and the answer is no.

I've now put a second HTTP-NG checkpoint up on the web; it's still pretty 
rough, but I've added a lot of new text (now that I have my own 
DragonDictate, it's a lot easier to get things done...)

Why don't they use a larger font, then? It _can_ be set to different 
fonts and sizes.

When can we expect to find a usable version of Arena? A version that requires a
zillion parameters on the command line is rather annyoing to use. AND it would be
nice to either have preferences-option inside the program, or a settings-file. (I
didn't say I didn't like Arena - I do. But there are a couple of features I miss
from Netscape)

I'd like to second this thought about subjects in mailto URLs.

I run a number of mailing lists using Procmail/Smartmail and it would
be really useful to be able to add "subscribe" and "unsubscribe"
buttons to a HyperMail archive page for these lists.

Could the QUERY_STRING be used in mailto such that the url would 
look something like:

      mailto:list-request@machine.com?subscribe

Is there a MIME Content-Type for files following the General MIDI standard?
It seems to me there ought to be.  Any comments?

I just released a program, doing something like this. It is not integrated into
a browserm rather it is a separate client. You can specify the URLs in an HTML
document (Netscape will do this for you), feed the document into the program,
give a date after which you consider the URL to be new and the program will
generate an HTML documents with the updated URLs (overnight if you wish.) It is
not the 'mail' paradigm, more like the Web (html) paradigm - you get a
document which
you can feed into your browser.

        Good idea,  Brian.   And good responses ... "yeah,  what he said".

        I wrote a not-fully-featured line-mode tool to help with
stuff like this.   I say,  cron it.   Signal the browser?   Maybe.
Obviously you'd *have* to signal the browser sometime ... somehow ...
in some cases.   But it makes sense (for now) to have an agent that
builds, say, HTML of  "things that have changed".

 ...
>Fenn home page *when*it's*changed*, and if it gets a 302 Redirect it'll

        That's a nice touch.   Yes,  that helps.   Suggests that I
should add redirection info as an optional second stream from 'webcat'.
That is,  you get the body of the file from its stdout and "meta info"
from file descriptor 2 or 3.   (not sure if I want to mix programmatic
non-error information with human readable error messages)

        I like Hakon's stong wording about being presently bound
to the mouse.   A browser that implements all this function should have
a CLI way to fiddle with the settings at least,  if not a CLI way of
doing just about everything.   I don't use a web browser as my desktop
interface.   Instead,  I typically invoke the browser quite like the
browser invokes 'xv'.   So I want to take input from non-human sources
to merge into my preferences.

a) there isn't
b) there probably should be
c) it's only useful if there are 'helper apps' for most platforms that
actually take such a file and do something interesting with it. I've
not been able to find any simple 'MIDI-play' utilities that are
generic enough to work for the wide variety of MIDI gear. Have you?

If one sticks to General MIDI (as the original posted suggested) it might 
not be too bad. The "showmidi" program need only be interface specific 
with no reference to what MIDI gear is actually connected (as long as 
it's General MIDI).

I recently read in 'Hacker Crackdown' by Bruce Sterling about an 
underground publication called 'PHRACK', editors Knight Ligthing and 
Tara King. Does anybody know if this still exists and if so where can 
I obtain copies? I know they had quite a bit of flak in the 1989's 
with the publication of a AT&T document (enhanced 911 services). I 
need to give a talk on computer crime and hackers and would like to 
include examples of this publication...

Pointers to similar publications also appreciated.

Thanks

I am not sure about other platforms, but the Mac contains Midi support
through QuickTime 2.0 - no external Midi equipment needed. I think that I
have read somewhere that QuickTime 2.0 will also become available for
Windows soon.

So you will NEVER download packages from the net, compile them and install
them? You rely on your native OS and its utilities completely. No-one
checks source code (e.g. Gnu <fill-in-here>, XV etc etc) for "rm -r *".
Just because you compile them doesn't make them safe. The same amount
of trust applies.

Sure, Safe Scheme/Tcl/Python are great for protecting yourself. But if
you're that paranoid, why risk ftping _any_ software other than that which
you buy and get a guarantee from. Even commercial packages contain disclaimers.

Dave.

This isn't really directed at this post, but just this argument, which I
have seen a couple times now...

While there are certainly many similarities between using public domain
software and documents with embedded programs, when it comes to safety I
think there are two major practical difference between them: the former
has a much more constrained distribution path, and requires that the user
explicitly retrieve and execute the software.

It is not too hard to imagine some WWW script which, when retrieved by a
browser, quietly digs out the user's home page and attaches itself there.
This kind of potential makes any current PD viruses pale in comparison;
there is simply no current situation like this, where such a high
percentage of consumers of programs are also -- even possibly unwittingly
-- producers of them.  If a virus is discovered in some PD program, it is
at least feasible to let people know such and such program has it, so that
it can be tracked down and removed.  I don't think any such action would be
possible with a WWW virus.

While you could theoretically say that browsers will warn their users when
they execute foreign scripts, I don't think this is a practical option; it
gets in the user's way enough that more than likely the vast majority of
users will either turn this off or just blindly hit "okay."  I think that
any practical scripting implementation -must- be something the user can
trust under normal circumstances.  Anything else either won't be used, or
just begging for all kinds of nastier-than-we've-ever-seen-before viruses.

The distinction is accountability. Source distributions don't
necessarily prevent attacks, but they allow you to detect them,
usually.

If you download source, presumably it has the author's email address.
Presumably that author is known to at least a few folks on the net.
If you compile the code, and it behaves antisocially, you can (1) look
at the source to find out why, (2) contact the author, or (3) sling
mud at his name publicly.

It's possible for an unnamed intruder to substitue source code with
an attack in it, but the file size or checksum of the distribution
will be different from all the other copies on the net. Granted...
not a lot of folks check that.

And in that case, the author can presumably diff the rogue sources
against his real sources and find exactly the difference.

So the same sorts of attacks that go with binaries can happen
with source distributions, but they're much more difficult to pull off.

The right answer is digitally signed distributions. Then only can
you be certain that the bits have not changed since they left
the author's hands.

Doesn't this suggest some utility in extending the URN/URL concept to
include an optional computed checksum as part of the identifier? Verifying
perfect identity of what you are getting against what you thought you were
requesting has some value for materials other than programs, too.  

The checksum could be recomputed dynamically every time the file is
transferred (as checksums are now computed dynamically every time an IP
packet is placed on or taken from a communication medium).

The HTML CyberClass(TM) is an Internet-based class on HTML, the World Wide
Web, and the effective development and use of homepages.  This class is
intended for people who have experience browsing the WWW, but are just
beginning to develop homepages.  We are considering offering more
advanced courses (including forms, image maps, searches, Perl and Bourne
Shell scripting etc.) for experienced developers in the future. 

The HTML CyberClass occurs every two months (except July-August).  The
next class will start May 1 and continue until approximately June 27. 
There is no specific "meeting time" for the class.  Participation in class
discussions, work on class assignments, communication with instructors,
all take place whenever we go online!

The CyberClass operates through a private discussion list available only
to registered class members, as well as an outline which is available to
anyone over the World Wide Web at:

http://www.halcyon.com/clearnts/html1class/outline.html

There is a lot of material explaining The HTML CyberClass linked to the
Clear Nets homepage at either of the following locations:

http://www.halcyon.com/clearnts/welcome.html     or
http://world.std.com/~habib/index.html

Please read through all this material before contacting us with
questions.  Thanks! 

The instructors of The HTML CyberClass are Peter Flynn, author of the
World Wide Web Handbook (pub: International Thomson Computer Press, 1995),
and Steve Habib Rose, Internet trainer and developer of The HTML
CyberClass. 

In cooperation with the Belgian Internet provider, Infoboard Telematics
Belgium, we are in the process of adding a truly international "flavor" to
The HTML CyberClass.  In the May-June class, we will be running a pilot
version of two discussion sections in French and German.  We are hoping to
add a Spanish language discussion section by the end of 1995, and are also
exploring the translation of class lectures and outline into different
languages.  You are encouraged to check the Clear Nets homepage throughout
the year for enhancements to the CyberClass. 

The cost for the two-month session is $150 (U.S.).  Full registration
information is available on pages linked to the Clear Nets homepage. 

Subscribers to Infoboard Telematics Belgium are requested to contact your
provider for separate registration instructions.  General information is
available on Infoboard Telematics Belgium at http://www.ib.be/

The deadline for receiving your check or money order for the May-June
session is April 25.  We must receive your check by that date to register
you for the class.  Please take into account the uncertainties of postal
delivery, particularly from overseas.  The next session is scheduled for
September-October, and the deadline for registration will be August 25. 

Thank you, and "see you" in class! 

Yours,

Steve Habib Rose

If you make the image a link, the alternative text will be a link in
non-graphical browsers, e.g.:

<A HREF="URL"><IMG SRC="foo.gif" ALT="[alternative text]></A>

Hi everyone,
Do you know if there is any MS-Windows C++ class (or set of classes) that 
implement an HTML Browser? 
I am interested to get the class(es) source code, so I could learn
how to do an HTML browser/editor.

Any freeware/shareware/commercial class(es) are OK as long as not too expensive
(it is "for me" not "for work").

Thank you for any help/pointers
Agostino

<My question is: Why does people use Mosaic when

Netscape is not free for all users.  Netscape is free for
personal users and non-profit organizations.  Companies and
government agencies that provide Web access to their users
must use a free browser, such as NCSA Mosaic, or pay for
Netscape or an enhanced Mosaic.

<Do you think that I should limit my layout so that

<because I really 
<enjoy the new features in recent versions of HTML.

You should do one of 2 things:

1.  Stop using the proprietary Netscape tags and stick to
standard HTML code so that the users of your information all
see it presented as intended.

2. You can continue using the Netscape tags, but you
should inform your users that your document has been
enhanced using these tags and is best viewed in Netscape. 
This is a common signt on the Web.

My initial reaction is it makes more sense for a new document type: 
signed-html.
The viewers for signed-html then worry about authentuicating the signature and
displaying proper messages etc.
I dont think a checksum is part of either a name (URN) or a location (URL).

I am currently setting up a home page for our site and I am wondering about
Copyright and published (and not yet published) papers.  We have some people
in our group who have some various papers they have written which I would
like to put on our web server.  We are wondering what issues there are to
putting a paper on a webserver.  Can you do it after it has been published
in a journal.  Can you do it if you are going to publish it in a journal.  

Hopefully someone has an answer to this question...

Yes. In particular, it requires the MD attribute on all A and IMG tags, anything

That is another level of security, where the document can be updated by 
the original author, signed again, and the link is still valid. MD checksums 
will not cope with that, as you say.

> I dont think a checksum is part of either a name (URN) or a location (URL).

But it is part of a link, in HTML 3.0; this does not require any changes 
to the URI syntax.

This is an interesting question. If I were you, I would check with the
journal(s) first. Web publishing might count as prior publishing (if it goes
on the Web first), and the journal might not like that.
As far as putting already-published stuff on, better find out who owns the
copyright, first--it might not be the author, in some cases.

Okay. So requirements are:

1. A Safe environment (account). cf. Safe Tcl/Scheme/Python/HotJava etc.
2. Trust that the code is genuine. cf. public-key cryptography.

Now, can anyone explain why they would NEVER download applets or binaries/
bytecodes given these requirements? All I'm trying to say is that a Safe Node
system for getting and executing software is safer (yes, safer) than
current practice, so rabid instance on complete security seems a bit OTT,
though of course completely justified in its own right.

Dave.

Copyright and the Internet don't go well together.  There's a growing
amount of literature (paper and electronic) on this subject.  Basically,
copyright protection is NOT removed when you put information up on a Web
server or any other information display device.  I'm speaking of works
that are copyrighted, not public domain material.

So the question becomes, what protection can copyright holders expect if
their work is released to the Internet, especially in an open environment
like the Web?  The answer of course is none unless the Web site itself
provides that protection.  Authors can put all the copyright symbols and
statements they want on their work, but they are still relying on the good
will of the researcher and reader to respect their copyright.

Having had many articles published in journals -- and having assigned
copyright to the journal publisher as a condition of publication -- I can
say that you will need to get permission in writing from the journal -- if
it holds copyright -- to put the material up on your Web site.  No harm in
asking, you might be surprised by the answer.

Of course I do those things.  Sometimes.  When I do I think carefully 
about where I'm getting them from, look at the source, and run them for 
a while under an account I keep for that purpose with no access to 
anything (the reason why I believe that even single user machines need 
multiuser security, but that's another argument).  People actually do 
this.  I recall a discussion on this very list a few months ago about a 
package who's installation script downloaded another script and 
executed it without warning.  People noticed.

If I were a using a browser that downloaded binary applets on a regular 
basis, even that level of care would become unmanageable.  Even 
assuming that the browser warned me that it was happening.

We may be in agreement here; let me test it by saying that my original 
point was that requirement 1 cannot be met by a binary distribution, at 
least in the somewhat coarse security environment provided by current 
hardware/operating systems.  I agree that an environment that does meet 
these two requirements is safer than much current practice, and 
probably even adequate for most purposes.

I'm not sure if you really meant so, but you seem to be implying that
there's no *legal* protection for copyrighted works served on the Web,
which is incorrect.  Even when a copyright holder posts to Usenet or this
mailing list, which carries implicit permission to copy (that's how they
work, after all), the copyright remains.  On the Web, there's no implicit
permission to make more copies beyond the one created by your browser.
There's virtually never an implicit release of copyright to the public
domain; that sort of thing can only be done explicitly, in writing.

Take this message, for example.  I believe that anyone has the right to
copy this message for just about any legal purpose, since I'm sending it to
the listserv software, which makes all the copies that people might
request.  However, I still hold copyright in this message, which means that
if you misrepresented it as your own (plagiarized), I'd have a legitimate
complaint.  However, since this message has virtually no commercial value,
my complaint would be more along the lines of unfair business practice than
copyright infringement.

The second part of your paragraph strikes closer to the practical reality,
which is that it's difficult to enforce copyrights when the intellectual
property is so readily copied and transmitted.  To a large extent, we do
depend on the good will of those who read Web pages and such, but we can
help that along by including copyright notices and clear descriptions of
our intentions when posting intellectual property on a Web server.

As to the original question, absent of any written agreement to the
contrary, the author of an article contributed to a journal will hold the
copyright, assuming that it is "work for hire," rather than work performed
by an employee in the normal course of a job (in which case the employer
holds the copyright).

Disclaimers -- this isn't legal advice, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not speaking
for Verity, these are my opinions based on U.S. law.  I was the editor of
"The Multimedia Producer's Legal Survival Guide" and I'll be talking about
this subject at Web World in Santa Clara...

The ACM has announced an interim copyright policy in the current
(April 95) issue of Communications of the ACM.  I quote some excerpts
from it below.  As I understand it, it does allow authors to place
papers on Web servers under some fairly easily satisfied conditions:

"When your work is accepted for publication, the editor will ask to
transfer copyright to the ACM."

"The original copyright holder (you or your employer) retains...the
right to post a personal copy on non-ACM servers for limited
non-commercial distributions, again provided the ACM copyright notice
is attached to the personal copy and the server prominently displays a
general policy notice about use of copyrighted works it contains"

"If the number of people who have access to the distribution [server]
is less than 1% of the ACM membership (currently 1% is 800 people),
you do not need prior permission for the distribution.  If the number
is larger you should get permission from ACM and the copies should
cite that permission."

The ACM copyright notice grants "permission to make digital or hard
copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom
use.. provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or
commercial advantage and that new copies bear this notice and the full
citation on the first page".

NCSA X Mosaic version 2.6b1 is now available for beta testing.
Binaries and source are available from 

ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Unix/


Improvements to 2.6b1

 o Inline JPEGs are supported. 
 o mailto URLs are supported. 
 o Improved Usenet support, including threaded newsgroup listings and article
   posting. 
 o Common Client Interface now supports POST to server, 
   SEND BROWSERVIEW and QUIT browser protocol functionality. 
 o PostScript printing and saving optionally includes URL and page number as
   page header. 
 o Minimal group annotation support. Set the annotationServer resource
   to the URL of your CGI annotation server. 
 o The URL text field is now editable. Pressing Enter within the text 
   field causes Mosaic to open the displayed URL. 
 o Load to local disk can now be activated on a one-time basis by holding down
   the shift key while clicking on a hyperlink. 
 o HTTP header Accept now lists only */* instead of a long string of MIME
   types. 
 o HTTP header Referer now contains a document's parent URL (for hyperlinks
   that are clicked-on with the mouse pointer, only). 
   NCSA httpd 1.4 can log the Referer field. 
 o HTTP header User-Agent now uses a slightly different format, for
   consistency with other platforms: 

    User-Agent: NCSA Mosaic/2.6b1 (X11; SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m) libwww/2.12 modified

 o Code has been Saber tested.

Is it possible that this field will ever conform to the spec?

Since there are parts of HTML 3.0 in the browser now (tables), could you 
*please* add

Accept: text/html; level=3

as per the W3O directive?  Even better would be something like

Accept: text/html; level=3; q=1.0
Accept: text/html; q=0.5

That way those of us with content-negotiating servers (yes, www.hotwired.com
is now a content-negotiating server - compare http://www.hotwired.com/ in
arena and netscape, and look closely at the source.  Arena can't parse the
Content-type header with extra info quite right yet so the HTML 3 is tagged
as text/html for now instead of text/html;level=3 but as soon as arena is
fixed we'll change) can dish HTML 3 pages to HTML 3 clients and HTML 2 to
HTML 2 clients.  I know X Mosaic doesn't support all of HTML 3 yet, but the
only way we're going to have a smooth transition is if the above happens even
while HTML 3 is being developed. 

If I add a "please" would this help things?  :)  I'd rather not have the 
server negotiate based on User-Agent instead!

			    GENERAL INFORMATION
			    ===================

Win32s Update Information
-------------------------

Windows NT users and Win95 beta-testers
---------------------------------------
Windows NT and Win95 are 32-bit operating systems with Win32s and OLE  
support built into the operating system. Users of Windows NT and Win95  
should NOT install Win32s on their systems.


Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups Users
--------------------------------------------
You have a 16-bit operating system and you'll need to install  
Microsoft's Win32s software. This software will allow you to run 32-bit  
applications in Windows 3.1 or WfW 3.11. Since Mosaic is also an OLE  
compatible application, Mosaic users must use Win32s with the OLE. The  
latest version of Win32s is available at NCSA's ftp site,  
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, in the /Mosaic/Windows directory. The file  
w32sOLE.exe is a self-extracting executable. After you download the  
file, put it in a temporary directory (c:\install), type w32sOLE, and  
all associated files will decompress.

The latest version of Win32s version 1.25.  It was released by Micorsoft  
to address the National Language Support problem and the compobj.dll  
problem some Windows users were experiencing with version 1.20. We  
recommend you upgrade to this latest version if you prefer to use a  
language other than English(American) in your Windows environment, OR if  
you experiencing problems with the compobj.dll library while using  
Microsoft Office, Excel or Word. In general, if you are NOT experiencing 
problems with Win32s v1.20, upgrading to Win32s v1.25 is not required.

Win32s must be installed BEFORE you install attempt to install Mosaic.

At the outset, let me say that my arguments were and still are from the
viewpoint of a dissemination strategy for existing technology and not from a
viewpoint of research.  To explain, I am more concerned with the question -

"How do we make sure that all this great technology doesn't get lost in
the marketing noise that will very soon flood the airwaves ?" and "How can
safe-tcl survive inspite of all the proprietary efforts ?"  

*rather than*

"What is the best/safest/most mature and proven technology".

This last question, is in my opinion, not always the right question to ask
*if we are concerned about market acceptance* which I believe we all
are.  Technically superb designs and implementations have failed to 
achieve market share, and in fact it is more the rule that technically
mediocre or even flawed technology ( need I mention the M.. company ) can
garner commanding positions through massive and well directed marketing
efforts. 
 
I initiated the intermediate language ( used here in the colloquial
sense of intermediate, rather than the CS sense of lower-level )
thread only to draw attention to the fact that a large number of 
relatively non-sophisticated users will be arriving soon. If the
current safe-tcl effort doesn't take them into account, they ( the
naive users ) will, by default, settle for the warmed over offerings 
from MediocreSoft(tm), your friendly neighborhood software company 
that wants to take over the whole world.

Having a platform like MS Network will give it a means to foist very
crude active mail models on a largely unsuspecting user/programmer
population in the vein of Dos, Win3.1, Visual Basic etc. Historically,
the Unix/Internet/University/Research Lab community has ignored these
technically unsophisticated approaches assuming they will fail in the market.

And people continue to think that because they don't
understand the Internet technology/culture MicroSplat will fail. 
How naive !!!

I feel that a similar thing may happen with the enabled mail efforts
and that alot of great technology may end up being just that - great technology
but with no ensuing products.  The bottom line is - there are no
known commercial products out there that are openly using safe-tcl.
A way to piggyback onto the momentum generated by  marketing-driven efforts
of MicroSpiff (tm )
would be to position safe-tcl as the intermediate language, thus leveraging all
existing development efforts and also using proven and safe technology.

Thus any restricted technology foisted upon the world by MicroSquash(tm),
your innovative, creative, communications company, will remain restricted in
use to the MSNetwork and safe-tcl efforts need not have to twist themselves
out of shape. In addition, to access the new and exciting content on the
Internet outside MS Network, MS Network users will have to have a way to
access safe-tcl based Net hosts. Voila'  safe-tcl intermediate language
to the rescue.

Enabled-mail content will remain safe-tcl, which can be translated into
and out of at sending and receiving ends respectively.  Rather than being
the all-encompassing enabled-mail language everywhere which is a very hard
goal to achieve, why not be the *transported language* of choice ?

This positions safe-tcl as complementary to any proprietary technology
and not in opposition.  My belief is that a head-to-head language war
with Visible Balsamic (tm) will fail simply from the numbers stand
point, and then you won't get a second chance.

The real question is, does the safe-tcl community want safe-tcl to ever be
a commercially deployed technology or is it something that is preferably kept
as a research plaything.  I don't see a clear answer to that question but the
responses I have received suggest that most safe-ctl users are from the
research side of things. ( At this point I woul like to add that this
doesn't, in any way deprecate the future efforts of the Ousterhout group
- I would consider their efforts to be based on producing tcl development tools
whereas when I say "products" I mean something outside the realm of   
development per se eg end-user products that are produced by safe-tcl
developers. )

My feeling is that if the safe-tcl community wants
to survive and prosper in commercial realms, they will have to start asking
different questions - questions more directed towards disseminating and
diffusing existing technology into commercial *products* and move away
from focusing on "my language is better than yours". I would like to suggest
that the "better" language doesn't always win in the market place.

So the real question is do we want to be a market/product based technology or
do we want to do some real neat things in our spare time ?
The kind of questions we are concerned with are, in my opinion, quite
different in the two cases.

Well, it's not far from it. Everything within '(' and ')' is to be considered
a comment which is not part of the field, but is allowed. So what is left is
the two phrases:

	 NCSA Mosaic/2.6b1	and 	libwww/2.12 modified

Here the problem is that both contain a space which is not allowed in a token.

A User-Agent field like

   User-Agent: NCSA-Mosaic/2.6b1 (X11; SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m) libwww/2.12-modified

would be OK.

  I proposed to the HTTP working group that this be changed to something
like:

User-Agent: NCSA Mosaic/2.6b1 ; library=libwww/2.12 modified ;
            os=SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m ; windowsystem=X11R5 ;
            other-fun=here

  This follows in the tradition of MIME having information that modifies
the main value (text/html ; version=3.0) - the version of Mosaic is
considered to be the main value, and all the others are just slight
modifications.  This also doesn't break old log engines that had to deal
with the severely broken way that NCSA mosaic used before.

  A few people liked it, but seems to be an HTTP/1.1 issue.

Hi,

about Mosaic2.5.

Trying to deal with tables in NCSA Mosaic 2.5, I'm facing some problems. I use 
a Sun Sparc20 running under SunOs 4.1.3

I used the tutorial at 
	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Tables/tutorial.html.

1. It appears that when a tag, (e.g. <B>...</B>)
is placed in a cell, it doesn't show on screen. More than that, the text that
follows the closing tag is lost and the cell doesn't format well. Lists,
Images don't show in the NCSA Tutorial. 
	(Sorry, I've just seen it's
	a reported bug in version 2.5)

2. When I save or print a page that contains a table from Mosaic (in Postscript, plain or formatted text), the table is lost in the saved file.

Did I misconfigure Mosaic 2.5 or is it a known problem about this version ?

Thanks

I strongly doubt that.  (And see below for stronger opinion.)
     
Viruses are instructions that need something to execute them.  (Biological 
viruses effectively are chemical instructions that need the chemical environ- 
ment of a cell to execute them; computer viruses are instructions in some form 
(e.g., hardware instructions, shell commands, mailer control file commands) 
that need some agent (e.g., hardware, shell, mailer program) to execute them.)
     
There have been mail viruses (or were they worms?), but as far as I know they 
are executed by the software that moves mail around, not by the end-users mail 
reader.
     
(For example, here's a virus:
     
"Send a copy of this sentence to someone else."
     
It is instructions to you, the human reader.  If you follow the instructions, 
it propagates; if you don't, it doesn't; if you ignore it and delete it, it 
dies.
     
Obviously, this virus isn't very effective, because humans usually will 
choose not to follow the instructions.  But it is a virus.
     
Hey!  I just realized---THE FORWARDED RUMOR IS A VIRUS!  (It doesn't 
explicitly contain instructions to forward it, but it's written knowing that 
people repeat rumors, so that's an implicit instruction to forward it. 
Therefore, it is a virus.)
     
But I, one valiant little antibody in the Internet immune system, have 
recognized the invader, and have mutated it, hopefully sentencing it to 
death.
     
(Now if only someone could do something about those (ex-?) lawyers who keep 
spamming the Internet...)
     
)

THIS IS 100% BULLSHIT!  Infinite loops don't damage CPUs.  And infinite 
loops are infinite loops; there's no such thing as "an nth-complexity 
infinite binary loop."
     
If readers don't believe me yet, then consider this:  The warning doesn't 
say anything about which kind(s) of computer the virus infects.  Because 
viruses are instructions, they can only infect hardware or software that 
understands and executes that type of instructions.  The only thing machines 
have to have in common to exchange mail is they they understand and process 
mail formats.  Therefore, any mail virus must be composed of instructions
in mail-exchange protocols, and those protocols aren't powerful enough to 
express the instructions needed to erase a disk (maybe fill it up with junk, 
but not erase it).

So...
     
Why did this bogus rumor start?
- Someone naive misunderstood something, including maybe a joke? 
- Some idiot decided to start a rumor?
- Someone is trying to prevent someone else's message from being read?
     
Why is Fell_Travis (dal11_tjfell@dal.mobil.com) passing it along?
- He (or she?) didn't know that it was bullshit, and was innocently passing 
	along a warning?
- He is an accomplice?

This strikes me as the $64M question.  Language translators are a
difficult thing to get right.  I have no idea, a priori, whether it is
easier to translate Python and Scheme into Tcl, or Python and Tcl into
Scheme, or Scheme and Tcl into Python.  I don't see any path to a quick
answer, and that concerns me.  -- Nathaniel

Hello,

My company needs to set up its own httpd server. None of us has any 
experience with it. We managed to get the NCSA httpd server up and have
set up a company home page. Can anyone suggest any good books or online
materials for admininstering a httpd server, writing CGI scripts, etc?

Thanks for any suggestions.

I think Java is evidence that the safe virtual machine approach is
viable. (scheme48 is more evidence, though they haven't done as much
engineering on the "safety" features). Language translators are a
tricky art, to be sure, but compilers are old hat.

I hope we see (maybe even write) Java bytecode compilers for Python,
scheme, Modula-3, and SmallTalk very soon. (I'd like to see designs
for dealing with continuations in the Java VM... I believe it's
possible, but I wonder if it's feasible). The possibility for code
reuse is staggering.

It's not clear that the library interfaces will be reusable across
these languages, but in my opinion, it looks promising.

I'm keen on the Java solution to multiple inheritance and binding time
of methods. Single inheritance, call by signature, and interfaces
looks very powerful. I wonder if the Modula-3 and ILU folks would be
interesting in supporting this model.

Actually, if William puts a document up on William's web server, it's not 
the browser even making the copy, technically. The browser merely asks 
William's machine to make a copy and send it to the browser.

Now, of course, the person using the browser can store it on disk or 
redistribute it or whatever, but that's not what I mean.

Hi,

about Mosaic2.5.

Trying to deal with tables in NCSA Mosaic 2.5, I'm facing some problems. I use 
a Sun Sparc20 running under SunOs 4.1.3

I used the tutorial at 
	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Tables/tutorial.html.

1. It appears that when a tag, (e.g. <B>...</B>)
is placed in a cell, it doesn't show on screen. More than that, the text that
follows the closing tag is lost and the cell doesn't format well. Lists,
Images don't show in the NCSA Tutorial. 
	(Sorry, I've just seen it's
	a reported bug in version 2.5)

2. When I save or print a page that contains a table from Mosaic (in
Postscript, plain or formatted text), the table is lost in the saved file.

Did I misconfigure Mosaic 2.5 or is it a known problem about this version ?

Thanks

Could anyone help me out on how to get the internet domain of my host 
(using a system call/lib function). I know that getdomainname returns the 
NIS domain, but that's not what I want.

Basically, I need to check if the given URL refers to the current host or 
somewhere else (my slogan: No Robots Please!). Any other suggestion in this 
regard?

Thanx in advance

You asked (on html-wg, not actually the right forum, thus the redirect):

> BTW, where/how does one register new URL `scheme' names? A couple of
> people have asked me if iphone://foobar or cuseeme://blort would ever
> become a reality.

Right now, the URI working group is suggesting that people write
internet drafts describing their new URL schemes and discuss them on
the URI mailing list (uri@bunyip.com). Eventually the URI group needs
to come up with a better registration procedure; if you have a
suggestion for such a registration procedure, please make it on the
URI mailing list.

There was quite a bit of discussion on the 'mailserver' URL, for
example.

For some kinds of resources, it isn't reasonable to pack everything
needed to access the resource into a single URL-like string; in those
cases, the way one usually handles this is to make a link (http: for
example) to a resource whose mime-type is a sesson description.

You retrieve the session description object, and then launch (via
.mailcap) the helper application that interprets the session
description by initiating the session.

I think this is a difficult design choice. Currently, most web
browsers are more flexible about adding more media types than they are
about adding new URL schemes.

[Oops, a mail that I have forgot to answer]

   Does anyone have experience with using psgml?  This is reportedly an Emacs
   major mode for editing SGML documents, but I have no experience with it (I
   use HTML-helper mode as well).  If the package works as advertised, one
   should be able to use it to edit HTML 3 just by supplying the appropriate
   DTD.

This should work, I have played a little with HTML 3.0. There
are some strange content model in the HTML 3.0 DTD (in the version i
tested, it is a draft after all). This makes i illegal to have white
space between a <fig> and a <caption> tag. This is probably nothing a
browser would care about, but it is the string SGML interpretation,
and psgml will complain if you put some white space there.

   I've CCed the author; perhaps he can comment on the suitability of psgml for
   editing HTML 3.

As the author I, of course, think that it is suitable for editing
anything SGML :)

But, as psgml is a general SGML-mode it doesn't have special
shortcuts for commonly used elements and entities. To insert a <HR>
tag, to take an extreme example, you will have to type C-c C-e h r
RET, or use a menu.  I find it most useful to not have to remember
attribute names and such when creating forms.



   psgml is available from:

     <URL:ftp://ftp.hmc.edu/pub/emacs/packages/psgml>

   which is mirrored from:

     <URL:ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/sgml>

Subject: Bug in CERN Library of common code ? 
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
X-Comment: To sign off, send mail to listproc@mail.w3.org with body DEL WWW-TALK

Hi,
I've been using the CERN Library of common code to 
pull in WWW documents and parse them for a certain
database I am building and I keep running into this 
problem for certain documents. 

The library code makes the http connection to the server,
and then waits forever to get the status line. The
library code doesnt seem to have a select or a timeout
as to how long it waits. This is a problem because the
process waits forever for a server to send a line of data
which never arrives. I know I could use the multi-threaded
version in which case I wouldnt block forever but I'd still
have unfinished calls hanging around. This also happens sometimes
when the library makes a call to get the body of the document
and it never arrives. 

I was wondering whether anyone had run into this problem before and
if so how to fix it. I'd like the call to terminate after a certain
timeout when this happens so that the rest of the documents
in the database can be parsed. I grepped through the NCSA libwww
that comes with XMosaic 2.4 and they have select calls there - 
should I just use the NCSA libwww or is there an easy fix for
the CERN one ? 

Please reply directly to me as I don't read the list very often.

thanks,
Yezdi

Last time I looked at psgml it didn't seem to have a lot of
documentation, has this changed?

Hi,

I have read the faq, and there is nothing about the compared performance 
of the various WWW server programs.

Can any body help me?
I would like to know for instance how the NCSA, the CERN, and the Netscape
servers compare in performance on a given architecture.
The actual architecture is relevant for the time being.

Thanks in advance,
Justin.

As my senior project, my professor wants me to intercept all the event calls
from Mosaic 2.4 and send them to a slave machine.  What I need is a list of
all the events.  Is there a .h or a .c file that defines all of them?  If
you have any suggestions as to how to proceed with this problem, please

I have a serious problem with the Common Logfile format, as presented at 
<URL:http://w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Config/Logging.html#
common-logfile-format>.  It indicates that the "request" portion of the 
log entry should be:

  The request line exactly as it came from the client.

Unfortunately with directory indexing, this means that three different 
requests all have the same semantic meaning:

  GET /dirname
  GET /dirname/
  GET /dirname/index.html

(Assuming that index.html is the dir index file, this too can vary.) Are 
the current logfile processing programs taking this vagarity into 
account? I intend to log

  GET /dirname/index.html

in all cases where index.html existed, and
  
  GET /dirname/

Subject: Realtime audio on the Web

I have been researching caching on the Web for a while now, and have
found that using both proxy caches as well as more sophisticated
server-based replication methods, network bandwidth can be reduced by
a factor of 60% or more. A draft of my thesis can be found
at:  http://das-www.harvard.edu/research/vino/push.cache/
or   ftp://steward.harvard.edu/users/gwertzman/thesis.ps.gz
for those who are interested.

I am worried that the real-time audio system will be used for
application that do not actually require real-time audio. There are
advantages to downloading a file first; namely that it is a cacheable
entitiy. A real-time audio stream by nature can not be cached. It may
be argued that this is a security precaution, that music companies do
not want their music to be easily copied, but it seems that it should
be trivial to re-record an audio stream as it is being received and
save it to a file.

It could be argued that network bandwidth is always growing, but it
seems foolish to knowingly waste it. There are several ways that the
Web community is already wasting bandwidth: html pages could easily be
compressed, for example, as part of the protocol, and uncompressed as
they are received. Likewise I am looking forward to certain dynamic
pages being made available as scripts that can be cached and
replicated. It is cheaper for a script to reference a piece of shared
data at the primary host than it is for the browser to retransmit the
entire page again with the updated information in place.

if someone knows more about the realtime standard I welcome their
comments; Maybe I'm wrong and it would be possible to cache these
pages. Certainly the original audio file could be replicated using the
techniques I have developed in my work, although proxy caching would
still be difficult.

I was going to say this is something you could do with a Perl script, one 
that parsed your config files so it knew accesses to /dirname/ = 
/dirname/index.html, but that information isn't necessarily available at 
log-analysis time if your site changes frequently.  

The real question is - what do you do when the requested object and the
object actually delivered differ?  This can be because of short cuts
(DirectoryIndex in httpd, soft links in the file system, etc) or now content
negotiation, where a request for /dirname/ could return /dirname/index,
/dirname/index.html, /dirname/index.html3, or /dirname/index.cgi. 
However, there are good debugging-related reasons for knowing the actual 
request was.

The choice is yours if you're going to change from logging the actual 
request to logging the actual object served; maybe this is an issue for 
CLF-NG.  A few of us have ideas about that - like maybe it should really 
just be an API whose expression can be a simple string of variables,
like

$HOST $IDENTD $AUTHUSER [$MDAY/$MN/$YR:$HR:$MN:$SC $GMT] "$REQUEST" $ERRCODE $LENGTH

to represent the current CLF.  This string could be shared with log file 
analysers and other applications that required it. 

Wishing I was in Darmstadt,

I've been following the recent discussion with interest here!  It seems to
me what may be critical to the success of safe-tcl is going to be the
"killer app" rather than the language wars.  Ultimately people use what
works and what fills the bill at the moment (witness DOS).  Maybe I've
missed it, but I've hardly seen any safe-tcl applications at all. How
about a listserve or majordomo based on safe-tcl as a possibly something
people might use right away.  It could also include some groupware sorts
of things like voting, easy to use community archives and such. 

Also, I didn't see any mention of Telescript in relation to ALF.  I know
it's propriertary and so far bundled with MagicCap, but from what I know
it has a lot of features that safe-tcl doesn't have.  For example, the
meet and go operations and the directory services all that allow agents to
know where to go and do things.  It seems these can either be part of ALF
in which case safe-tcl has a ways to go, or they have to be layered on top
of ALF in another standard.  They seem important to agent-based products
to me. 

Last, the Netscape-Adobe deal that puts an Acrobat viewer in the Netscape
browser piqued my interest.  PostScript is a full language that could do
agent stuff.  Anyone think this is on Adobe's agenda?  They could have
software to run "PostScript Agents" on many peoples desk in a matter of
months!

I'm prepared to log both.  My server will provide multiple logging 
levels, and I will include perl scripts to turn any format into the 
common log format for statistics packages.  If it were one or the other, I 
think most people would prefer knowing what data was sent to what was 
requested.

> $HOST $IDENTD $AUTHUSER [$MDAY/$MN/$YR:$HR:$MN:$SC $GMT] "$REQUEST" $ERRCODE $LENGTH

This is a nice idea.  The trick is getting support from the statistics 
package writers and the server writers, because each would wait on the 
other, I'd imagine.

I've been thinking about this too.  Let's call the string a "log
template".  Why not base it on the strftime() function?  The current
CLF would be:

%R %i %u [%d/%m/%Y:%H:%M:%S %O] "%q" %s %n

where:

%R remote client name
%i user ident
%u authenticated user name
%O offset from GMT
%q literal request from client
%s status code
%n number of bytes sent

and the others are as defined by strftime().

Other things you might want are:

%l IP address the request was received on
%L host name corresponding to %l
%Q document actually served
%r remote client IP address
etc

You could also record an arbitary HTTP header using (eg)
%:user-agent:

If you do this, PLEASE make the field separator consistent - particularly
as the date/time in the above string is so hard to parse with tools like
'awk'

One other field that we have found very useful is to also record the
time that the object was last modified; this information is useful for
calculating how often your files change, and which objects change
frequently versus those objects that don't change too
frequently. We needed this information in order to analyze various
cache consistency protocols; your mileage may vary.

I, too, am very interested in safe-TCL, though I'm personally more
interested in using it to extend a Web server rather than to extend a
Web client.  I searched the TCL FAQ a month or so ago and didn't find
anything more on safe-TCL than a paper describing its design.  The
paper nor the FAQ mentioned where to pick up an implementation.  Even
a buggy implementation would be a good thing to play with -- the paper
didn't make it sound like *doing* it would be tremendously difficult,
but reinventing  a wheel doesn't appeal to me.  :-)

I don't know if there are any in-the-know safe-TCL folks subscribed to
this list, but a quickie message about implementations and/or mailing
lists would be useful to at least this person.  In the meantime, I'll
dig for more FAQ & other info on TCL in general and, gasp! wade
through the stuff currently in comp.lang.tcl to see what I can find.

An implementation of SafeTcl is available from 
ftp://ftp.fv.com/pub/code/other

Other directories under /pub/code give examples of using SafeTcl for 
extending web servers. In addition, http://www.infohaus.com/ is running 
about 98% SafeTcl code (besides the httpd itself).

The other choice is to send mail to nsb+faq@nsb.fv.com (I think that's 
right) to get Nathaniel's latest FAQ, wherein it will list places to get 
SafeTcl and all.    --Darren

list,

does any have any info on the progress and/or general availability
of file upload capable http clients per following 'File Upload' 
capability description:
 
	This is an implementation of File Upload as described in the latest
	ietf draft proposal by Larry Masinter and Ernesto Nebel.  It
	implements the INPUT TYPE=file and ENCTYPE=multipart/form-data.

i am really interested in this capability - does anyone know when Mosaic

I'm new to this discussion but it seems that you should take a look at
Java (http://java.sun.com/). It has all the features of Safe-Tcl, it is
secure, the performance is better, and it is freely available.

Isn't TeleScript like Tcl but with postfix notation? Isn't TeleScript a 
propriatery language?

I believe that Acrobat only supports PDS, but I may be wrong. PDS is
not a full PostScript language implementation. It only supports the
graphics primitives.  For a language to be useful in a WWW browser you
need much more that a "full" language. You need a complete
infrastructure for embedding, security, internet libraries etc.
PostScript is not appropriate for that.

Have fun,

Hello Scott,

I believe you can subscribe to the safe-tcl mailing list at 
  safe-tcl-request@cs.utk.edu. 

You can also get the safe-tcl implementation from 
  ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/mrose/safe-tcl/safe-tcl.tar.Z

In re log analysis, we fairly consistently see about 26%-27% of
browing IP addresses showing up unresolved.

Does that much of the Internet indeed have broken DNS reverse lookups,
or is that high a percentage some sort of artifact of how the httpd
server (NCSA httpd in our case) does logging?

Er, it's entirely up to you, the server administrator, to decide how to
separate strings (with this system).  You should be cognizant of what
characters may show up in which strings, however - for example, spaces are
allowed in the request, the user_agent, even the authentication name.

You could compile with -DPARANOID and just drop connections that you 
can't reverse lookup :-) (no, you can't really, tcp wrappers joke.)

That high percentage is accurate.  Many web accesses are from dialup slip 
and ppp connections, and many of the providers of these services do not 
provide reverse lookups.  It's annoying but that's the modern Internet.

It's not "broken" DNS reverse lookups, it's just sites that choose (for 
security reasons, maybe) to not have reverse lookups enabled.

We see about the same. I was guessing these were people with dial-up slip 
accounts with dynamic IP assignments.

Hi all,

Greetings.

I am doing a research on above.  In a nut shell, when
2 users access a URL through WWW, both users can see each other screen.

Any information or references to sites or people are greatly appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.

Regards,

  Emacs-w3 has had it in there for a while.
  I've roughed out a quick fix for AIR Mosaic to do it, but I don't think
it is going to make it into the next release (too much feature creep as it
is)

Does anyone know where to find a HTTPD server for NT?  I checked out all the
standard places, eg ncsa's ftp site, cern's ftp site, cdrom, indiana, all,
to my suprise, had no NT software at all, let alone a HTTP deamon.  Any
pointers?

Yes, it is a trivial thing to do -- wwwstat has done it since v0.1.

Reason: it would by lying -- that is not the request it got, so it shouldn't
be logging it as if it was.  For instance, I am usually interested in cases
where there are a large number of requests for

    GET /dirname

since that usually means somebody has advertized (or included as a link)
the wrong URL for that dirname.  Your scheme would prevent me from finding
those cases in the logfile.

In that case, don't do it -- you just introduced an unreliability.
If the server mucks with the request, I can't rely on it for maintenance
and security checks.

Hi,

I would like to ask about home pages. In our research center, people want
to prepare their own home pages. Until now there was a few of such people
and I said that you prepare it in your home directory and I can link it to
our main web directory. It was Ok till now. But now so many people want
a home page with their photo in it. How can I deal with it? 

Thanks in advance...

I am unable to get on the screen the "Helper Application panel" that is referred
to in the Netscape documentation...

How can I tell Netscape 1.0 on HP-UX 9.01 to use a postscript viewer 
for the *.ps files ?

   Er, it's entirely up to you, the server administrator, to decide how to
   separate strings (with this system).  You should be cognizant of what
   characters may show up in which strings, however - for example, spaces are
   allowed in the request, the user_agent, even the authentication name. 

..meaning that a system administrator could easily decide on a log
format which was *impossible* to parse.  I'm not sure allowing this is
doing them any favors.  Including the quotes in the expansion of %q,
and replacing the string of date-piece directives above with something
that expanded to a single, consistent, well-delimited date format
would guarantee that it is at least *possible* to parse the resulting
log file.  (It would also make it a whole lot easier on people who
wanted to write adapative log-file analysers without necessarily
including all the smarts necessary to handle arbitrarily complicated
delimiting constructs...).

Yes.

Yes. But precisely this dialog box only contains 4 items

	Global Types File: /usr/local/netscape/mime.types
	Personal Types File: $HOME/.mime.types
	Global Mailcap File: /usr/local/netscape/mailcap
	Personal Mailcap File: $HOME/.mailcap

This is not the scrolled list they are talking about in the
documentation...

Moreover, I have no clue on how those files should be constructed,
Currently none of these files exist on my system.

This whole thread of "safe" languages is rather troubling to me.

I spent more years than I care to count building secure operting systems, 
often using formal models of security and performing various degrees of 
proof of correctness on the software itself.  In essence what we were 
building were "safe" environments for the execution of unverified software.

The problems are these:

	- One person's "safe" is another person's security violation -- in
	other words finding an acceptable policy is very hard.  (Denial of
	service is a particularly hard concern to factor into a policy.)

        In many cases, people don't state their security policy, either
	formally or informally.  This is a real problem, because without
	a security policy, one can not judge whether
	
	  a) If the enviroment works as advertised, whether it is sufficiently
	     powerful to use for the desired job.  (I.e. if the policy
	     has a 100% prohibition against inter-user data flow, then
	     that environment would not be useful to support a multi-user
	     chat application.)

	  b) Without a policy it is impossible to evaluate the
	     implementation of the abstract "safe" machine to see whether
	     it is, in fact, "safe" according to the policy.

	- It takes work to gain sufficient trust that the policy is enforced
	by the abstract machine, no matter what sequence of actions are
	performed by the unverified software.  Some people do this by making
	the abstract machine very simple or very restrictive.  (An example
	of this is a calculator.)

	But it takes more work to determine whether to trust the more
	sophisticated abstract machines.  You can test it, but it's
	usually impossible to test all possible sequences of states that
	the unverified software may cause.  And formal proof of correctness
	is something that is very hard to do.

	- Sometimes the degree of trust of the "safe" environment can be
	reduced by allowing it to run only programs which have been
	examined and blessed.  This is the argument that many people
	make regarding the importion of source versus binary code -- if
	you can inspect it you may feel safer about running it.

In a typical OS, such as Un*x, we've spent years trying to build a "safe" 
environment in which users can write code which doesn't violate one 
another's security.  We're not there yet.

So we put people into restricted shells or application, which rather
limits the usefulness of the "safe" environment, often to the point where
the "safe"  environment is useless as a vehicle to get the needed job
done. 

Safe-TCL occupies this middle area.  It tries to find a useful balance
between a restrictive environment and utility.  For many people, this
balance is adequate.  It is likely that over time, we will find that it
is, however, overly restrictive to support some new, imaginative,
multi-user applications. 

I, for one, would like to see a policy defining what we want from a 
"safe" environment.

I'll start off by asserting that such a policy should support 
interactions between multiple users -- which implies that there can be 
data flows between the users.  (The reason I'm starting with this is that 
WWW browsers like Hot Java or Sesame (?) can easily evolve so that the 
users are interacting directly with one another through a matrix of 
connections rather than through a shared server.)

Can someone explain where one should use a 403 response versus a 400
response? Is using 400 only for mailformed requests, and 400 for
requests with a command that isn't understood a reasonable
interpretation?

	Thanx,

 I am not absolutely sure about this but I think that
 is a server side thing.  You will a line like this

 application/postscript         ai eps ps

 in your mime.types file under ~httpd/conf/

 Does anyone else know about this?  I am also curious
 at to it's workings?

 Our server allows you to open a users home page with

 Does that work for you?

My spec indicates that 403 implies greater server understanding than 400 
does.  A 403 means the server tried to service the request, and failed, 
while a 400 means that the server knew based on the request that it would 
fail.

There does seem to be some abiguity here, but both codes instruct the 
client not to repeat the request, so I don't think it's critical.

Ummmm, almost.  400 Bad Request indicates that the server was unable
to understand the request due to it being malformed.  403 Forbidden
indicates that the server *did* understand the request, but refuses to
service it for some reason that remains unknown to the client.

> There does seem to be some abiguity here, but both codes instruct the

There is a certain amount of overlap between 400 and all 4xx responses,
but I don't consider that to be ambiguous.  I'll change the spec so
that the purpose of the two codes is clarified.

Hmmmm, I could just change the example Reason Phrases to

     400 You screwed up
     403 Piss off

Just FYI, GeneralMagic and Metrowerks made an announcement on March 13 that
Metrowerks would be making a MagicCap development environment that is
hosted on a Macintosh. Details/PR can be found at

Hi Nurdan,

>But now so many people want a home page with their photo in it. How can I
deal with it? 

Get a raise $  :)

Or, what we have done to manage large amounts of data, is to put the
information into a database (Paradox for Windows), and to write some
not-too-difficult programs (in ObjectPAL) which generate the necessary pages
with the links, based on the information in the database.

That way you can just add people's names & http: codes to the database, and
"regenerate" and upload the html pages whenever you feel like it.

Hello,
Is this the way to access the www? On the "intro to the www" it said to
telnet to info.cern.ch, if new. I have only e-mailed so far, and can't find
how to "telnet" if that is different from e-mail. If you can give me
information, thank you.

* Fundamentally HTML 3.0 (ie: highly container based), plus many extensions
  for richer formatting capabilities. Extensions such as for multiple 
  columns formatting, document insertion (client side), and dynamically 
  collapsable/expandable list. 

* Sidebar panel: for displaying "meta" information, or for intra document
  navigational links, etc. The panel is engaged and disengaged by the 
  presence of the document that is associated with the sidebar document. 

* Dynamic toolbar: document engaged tool applets (ie: navigational aids). 

* Rudimentary stylesheet mechanism for attaching styling information to
  a document. For changing document's fonts, color information, alignments.

* A scripting language that is accessible from the HTML, such that an HTML
  document can embbed highly interactive scripts/applets. 

* Miscellaneous niceties: hotlist facility; shows HTTP loading progress
  in a pie chart (when it has the information). 

* An experimental platform. It's source available, even most of the 
  browser is constructed in a highlevel scripting language; and is very 
  customizable to someone who understands the scripting language. 

* Motif front-end. The X11 (non Motif) version is also available.

* Self contained single binary for easy installation, unlike the old 
  ViolaWWW which required setup of various viola application files.

There are a couple systems starting to be deployed now that attempt to gain
information about "clickstreams".  "Clickstreams" are the paths people take
when they traverse your site - many content providers would find it useful to
be able to detect common patterns or the effectiveness of various user
interfaces.  The problem is, of course, that HTTP is stateless, and beyond
the hostname offers very little in the way of identification of unique
"trips" through the content site.  Given that more than one person can use a
hostname (proxy servers, etc), there's no reliable way to exactly identify a
unique person without implementing access control (as I did at HotWired, and
believe me, it's not a general solution). Compound this with the fact that
people can begin and end their "trips" at any page on a site, and you'll see
this is a big problem for sites interested in this kind of statistical
information.

The systems being implemented, by companies like IPRO (http://www.ipro.com/)
and content providers like PathFinder (http://www.pathfinder.com/) are
fatally flawed.  They create a unique session ID when a user touches their
home page that gets encoded between the hostname and the path/file in the URL
(in the case of pathfinder), and that session ID stays with you throughout
your journey through the site.  Of course, this session ID also stays with me
if I save a hotlist reference to a page beyond the home page, or if I cut and
paste the URL and mail it around to my friends.  In the latter case, if I'm
given the session ID of "KJHFJHDSF", then all my friends go visit that page,
they'll all see accesses under session-ID "KJHFJHDSF".  This system also
destroys caching of documents, both local disk and proxy caches.  I told 
this much to a reporter at MediaWeek last week.

There is definitely a demand for this kind of information, and it would 
help make professional web sites more responsive to what really works and 
what doesn't - and this is also information that current web logs 
and the HTTP protocol really can't provide.  However, any proposed 
solution *must* protect the anonymity of the user, for it's not really 
necessary to lose that when all that's cared about is unique sessions.

So, I'd like to propose for discussion a new HTTP header (hi Roy!) called 
"Session-ID".  This would be optional, of course, and it would change any 
time the browser is restarted (or when the user wished).  It would 
consist of a string of 32 random base 64 characters (or whatever encoding 
is allowed in headers).  It would allow the content provider to see the 
"path" one takes through his system, even when two separate requests are 
interlacing through a proxy server (HotWired would often get 5 
individuals hitting it from antares.prodigy.com at the same time), 
without requiring user authentication or divulging of any personal 
information.  The "From:" header would also work, but it would give away 
information that most would probably prefer not to give.  

The only flaw is that the session-ID is temporary and can't be used to 
determine if 50 sessions are 5 people visiting you 10 times, or 50 people 
visiting you once.  An analysis of domains can help with that though.

Comments?  I'd obviously like to try implementing this, maybe it's time 
to learn elisp..... :)

Hello List,

        I have a couple of questions regarding .CGI scripts.  Could someone
point me to a good introduction to scripts?  Am I correct in understanding
that the scripts are generally written in C?  That is no good for me (since
I don't code).  That being the case, are there any scripts already written
that are available to the non-programmer?

        See, my situation is this:  I'm an Intern here at Georgia Southern
University, and while I have a good deal of Intneret experience, and I can
write good html, I'm totally unfamiliar with scripts and programming and
the like.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This is an excellent idea.  With Referer logging, you can already  
produce a "Markov model" for your Web site, giving transition  
probabilities between pages.  But it would be interesting to find  
out just how independent link choices really are; i.e., once a user  
gets to a page, how much does it matter where they came from?  To  
the extent that it matters, the Markov model is inaccurate.

Yes, and the statistics of access intervals don't help.  Intervals  
between requests from the same host seem to follow a combination of  
two very distinct exponential distributions whose decay rates  
differing by over an order of magnitude; presumably the long-term  
exponential represents intervals between user sessions through the  
same gateway host.  But the problem with exponential distributions  
is that the maximum probability occurs at zero, no matter how long-  
or short-term they might be...

More than once I have had users approach me to request a similar
capability, so there's an evident need.

I think the basic technique should work as follows:
1) The server is free to return (or not) to the client a SessionID
response header.
2) The client should (but need not, particularly to provide
compatibility with existing clients) send a SessionID request header to
a given host.  The header should be whatever SessionID header the
client last got from that host, independent of the URLs requested.
3) The content and meaning of the SessionID header are opaque to the
client.

One problem with this proposal is what should proxies do with
SessionID?  Here's one proposal.  Don't use SessionID as part of the
cache key.  If a document is in the cache, return it, and reflect back
to the client any SessionID sent by the client.  If the document is not
in the cache, pass through any SessionID.

Wouldn't it be an advantage to some kind of
'realm' scheme as in Basic Authentication, so 
different parts of a server could have different
sessions?

We have been doing some work along these lines.  Here
is a proposal for a session based id that is capible
of storing id's accross user sessions.  Hopefully
this can be polished up and added to the next HTTP
spec.

--------------------------------------------------

Syntax of the Set-Cookie HTTP Response Header:

Set-Cookie: NAME=OPAQUE_STRING \
            [; expires= ] \
            [; path=] \
            [; domain=] \
            [; secure]

Syntax of the Cookie HTTP Request Header:

Cookie: NAME=OPAQUE_STRING *[; NAME=OPAQUE_STRING]

Semantics:
     The Set-Cookie tag, when sent from server to client as part of any HTTP
     response, instructs the client to send the name/value pair using the
     "Cookie:" header to the server whenever returning to the specified server
     location.

     The server location may be specified in several ways:

        o "Set-Cookie" without any optional arguments specifies that all
          subsequent requests to the same server within the subtree defined by
          the referring URL will include the NAME=OPAQUE_STRING pair. The root
          of the subtree is determined by stripping everything after the last
          slash. For example, if the referring URL pointed to a file
          "/foo/bar/baz.html" the root of the subtree will be defined by
          "/foo/bar/".

        o The "path" attribute, if present, specifies which path in the server
          URL namespace forms the root of the tree for which requests shall
          include the NAME=OPAQUE_STRING name/value pair. Note that the pat is
          used as a mask value whereby any URL in the same server whose first
          path characters exactly match the "path" string will match. Therefore
          the path "/foo" would match "/foobar" and the "/foo/bar.html". The
          path "/" is the most general path.

        o The "domain" attribute, if present, specifies a server domain in the
          form of a TCP/IP domain name. Note that the domain acts as a tail end
          mask. All hosts within the specified domain will recieve the cookie
          on subsequent requests. Only hosts within the specified domain can
          set a cookie for a domain and domains must have at least two (2)
          periods in them to prevent domains of the form: ".com" and ".edu".
          ".mcom.com" is an example of a valid domain.

        o The "expires" attribute specifies an RFC 850 date string that
          indicates when the cookie should be purged.

     Also note that:

        o Multiple "Set-Cookie" headers can be issued in a single server
          response.

        o Instances of the same path and name will overwrite each other, with
          the latest instance taking precedence. Instances of the same path but
          different names will add additional mappings.

        o Setting the path to a higher-level value does not override other more
          specific path mappings. Therefore you may receive a duplicate name
          string if other mappings have been made for more specific
          directories. (See examples below.)

        o The "expires" attribute acts as an indication of when the client can
          dispose of the "Set-Cookie" mapping. Clients are encouraged to hold
          the string as long as possible or until the expires date has passed.
          The expires header lets the client know when it is safe to purge the
          mapping but the client is not required to do so. Clients should never
          send a cookie to a server after the expires date has passed. Cookies
          sent without an expires header are assumed to be short lived and
          should be purged from the client at the end of the users session.
          This is typically done when the user quits the client application.

        o The "secure" attribute tells the client to only send the name/value
          pair when speaking on a secure channel. This protects against the
          case where the same server has secure and non-secure transactions
          taking place on the same server and the transmission of the
          name/value pair could be a security risk. (Note: if the port number
          of the request is always taken into account when deciding whether to
          send a name/value pair, this attribute is probably not actually
          necessary at this time.)

        o The client returns the OPAQUE_STRING to the server in the form of a
          "Cookie: NAME=OPAQUE_STRING *[;NAME=OPAQUE_STRING]" header. The
          name/value pairs can be spread among more than one "Cookie" header if
          the client so chooses.

        o Semi-colons, commas, and whitespace are not allowed in the
          NAME=OPAQUE_STRING. Servers are expected to use an escaping mechanism
          to send and read the NAME=OPAQUE_STRING. The '%xx' hex string
          escaping mechanism used for URLs is recommended (a space character
          maps to '%20', etc.).

        o When sending cookies to a server, all cookies with a more specific
          path mapping should be sent before cookies with less specific path
          mappings. For example, a cookie "name1=foo" with a path mapping of
          "/" should be sent in front of a cookie "name1=foo2" with a path
          mapping of "/bar" if they are both to be sent.

Brian's proposal has no effect on server statefulness (else I would  
have objected strenuously).  And HTTP servers have always been  
"optionally stateful".  So I'm not sure what you are asking...

According to the NCSA folk it was struck by lightning and will be out of 
commission for a few days.  I could have sworn the docs were also 
available as a tar file on the NCSA FTP server but I can't seem to find 
them...

A very mature proposal - now we need some test implementations :) Any
volunteers?  The browser should allow the user to NULL their session ID at
any time (or turn off the functionality, even if by default it is on).

  I just added this to emacs-w3, and have been playing around with it with
the server on my linux box.  It lets you do some nifty things.

  I called it 'Session-ID'

  I would say there is really no need for this.  If the clients always send
a 'global' session id, this works well.  What I did in emacs-w3 was to keep
an assoc list of machine:port# mapping to the session id.  If the server is
not found in this list, then the default is sent.  The default is
regenerated each time the client restarts.

  This way, http://www.hotwired.com/login.html could return a session-id
header, and that would override all subsequent responses.

  Definitely should be.  I made the default session-id be a message-id
(looks like: <WMPERRY.1995418161020@monolith>).  I'm pretty the range of
valid Message-IDs could encompass a base64 encoded string as well, so
perhaps we should use the same BNF as for message-id?

No - if the document is in the cache, there are two options based on whether
there was an "Expires:" header in the HTTP response.  First, if there was no
Expires: header when the object was first fetched, do an If-Modified-Since,
and pass the Session-ID information through in both requests.  If there 
was an Expires: header, no If-Modified-Since request is necessary, and 
don't bother with sending an old Session-ID.  

The logic is, if content providers are labelling their content with 
"Expires:" headers, they are essentially saying "I grant permission to 
redistribute without notification - I'm more interested in lots of people 
seeing this than I am with knowing their viewing habits".

I have two reservations about this proposal relative to Brian's.

First, I'm not sure I see the need for putting so much semantic  
complexity into the protocol, where it will burden all clients and  
servers.  Other than the cross-session stuff, can't all of the same  
information be deduced by a minimally intelligent server based on  
the simple client-generated Session-IDs that Brian suggested?

Second, the cross-session capability is a really poor man's  
solution for storing state client-side.  Isn't the persistent  
document cache already a much more sophisticated place for storing  
state across sessions on the client?  Why have a separate, parallel  
mechanism for caching and security of these limited, HTTP-specific  
"cookies"?  I'd rather see some new HTTP metainfo which gives hints  
for persistent caching and reloading of documents (I'm not sure how  
to do this though...).

I agree.  I don't see any need for the server to be able to choose  
Session-IDs.  A server that wants to make use of Session-IDs simply  
needs to maintain an associative table; if the server is being  
implemented to be stateful anyway, that's small change.

I'm interested both in "clickstreams", and in keeping track of  
individuals players in multi-user games (light security only).  In  
the games, server state typically takes the form of "agents" who  
carry out players' strategies during rounds between player  
check-ins.

Oops, good point about proxies...that changes everything.  Because  
even for "clickstreams", you'd need to at least include the  
Session-ID in the cache key, and probably even turn off proxy  
caching altogether.  (Otherwise, users grazing the same proxy cache  
could mask each other's trails from the server's point of view.)

And now since Session-ID defeats proxy caching, it clearly must be  
left up to the server to actively request the use of Session-ID.   
With that, we might as well allow the server to specify the  
Session-ID, and so we're right back up to what Dave Kristol  
proposed.  Anything else I missed?

1) there are a few hyperlinks for cgi scripting, but imho the best is 
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi

2) scripts can be written in any language that can accecpt command line
arguments.  Most typical scripts are written in shell scripting languages,
PERL, or C.

I wonder if someone could point me to some code that
would show how to serve up data tailored to a particular browser.
Specifically, I would like to serve a file with
some tables as <PRE> blocks for browsers that do not get tables
yet, and html3 table stuff for browsers that do.
Thanks In advance.

I've got a copy of some of the docs for NCSA httpd 1.3 up at
<URL:http://hill.lut.ac.uk/httpd_1.3/docs/> - its mainly for local use
when NCSA is unreachable (most of the time :-) ) but others are welcome to
use them while NCSA is out of action if it helps.

I'm intrigued my the idea of the session-id cookie as a potential means of
accounting for state external to the content of the documents being passed
back and forth over the wire. If the server is the agent responsible for the
initial insertion of the cookie into the dialog, then the id carries with it
the notion of a centralized state mechanism. If the client is the initial
agent for inserting the cookie into the dialog, then a distributed state
mechanism is possible where the client is directing potentially many servers
to maintain information on behalf of a particular client. i.e.  a session id
could be used to represent a user, a group of users, a particular user
session, a particular window of a particular session, etc.

I heartily agree; this helps with some problems that I have been
discussing in terms of tracking a user for providing both dynamic pages
as well as having dynamic action.

Now that we have just made HTTP (optionally) stateful, what did we
break?

This is an excellent idea.  With Referer logging, you can already  
produce a "Markov model" for your Web site, giving transition  
probabilities between pages.  But it would be interesting to find  
out just how independent link choices really are; i.e., once a user  
gets to a page, how much does it matter where they came from?  To  
the extent that it matters, the Markov model is inaccurate.

Yes, and the statistics of access intervals don't help.  Intervals  
between requests from the same host seem to follow a combination of  
two very distinct exponential distributions whose decay rates  
differing by over an order of magnitude; presumably the long-term  
exponential represents intervals between user sessions through the  
same gateway host.  But the problem with exponential distributions  
is that the maximum probability occurs at zero, no matter how long-  
or short-term they might be...

I assume that the mean response time refers to the mean of the initial
response times.  It would also be very useful to compare times to the
end of the response, or mean time per connection.  This is probably a
better measure for judging "client satisfaction" and may not 
corelate that highly with mean response time.

I like where this string is going. I suspect that the session-id problem
can be solved in a more general way, giving Gary the broader abilities
he describes. I wonder if there is not an even more general approach
that extends from client to server documents--documents may embed 
cookies and query the client about what cookies it has.

The exchangable cookie (we called it tokens/knapsack) idea was discused 
many hypertext design sessions held by the davenport group. Everyone was
excited about the possiblities. Cookie semantics ranged from "have you
seen document x" to "do you prefer video" were discussed. Indeed, it seems
that this is the start of a client/server agent information exchange
protocol.

As always, I am looking for more...but I would be delighted with 
session ids alone.

My proposal is meant to solve a much broader set of problems than
a simple session id.  The "Cookie" idea allows the server to
save state information within the client for use in a broad
class of applications.  One of it's more useful applications
is an online shopping basket.  While shopping, the server
can place tokens within the client's cookie mechanism to
represent items that the user wants to buy, when the user
wants to "checkout" they simply go to a cgi script that
digests all the cookie information and assembles a
price/receipt/shipping information/etc.  If you try
to use documents or URL's to hold such information you
inevitably get errors due to the user hitting the
back button or reload or any other out of order
navigation method.  Using a cookie there can be no
confusion since the state isn't tied to the URL or
a particular document.

By using a "realm" concept through the use of path
mappings the cookie proposal allows multiple cgi
applications running on the same server to each
have a seperate and private cookie, this allows
for multiple non-interacting applications running
on one server and a higher degree of privacy.

This can be implemented in about 500 lines of C code so it's not
really as complex as it might sound.  This is also very
similar to the way access authorization works so there can
be alot of shared code involved.

Embedding state information in documents is the wrong
way to accomplish this.  Information embedded within a
document is dependant on the path used to enter a server.
If you don't access through the same URL you lose the information.
With cookies the information is sent regardless of your
navigation path.

This is not one of the more reassuring comments I've seen in WWW design
discussions.

We're not just implementing a client or a server;  we're doing protocol
design.  Protocol design is hard.  (Well, good protocol design is hard).

The best example I know of this is a message that Van Jacobson sent (in 
1988?) describing modifications to TCP to deal with congestion (slow-start 
and congestion detection/backoff).  It's a pretty long and dense E-mail 
message.  Almost all of the message is an analysis of the problem and a 
solution;  the code to implement it is something like two variables and half 
a dozen lines of code (and, I think, no changes to the bits in the protocol 
spec, just a change in the way that implementations use it).  It's a small 
change, but it makes all the difference to how the net runs (a small matter 
of avoiding meltdown).

So...  "it's only 500 lines of C" may provide a reasonable comfort level 
for, say, a discussion about a whizzy new GUI feature, but when it's about 
a protocol it's pretty scary.

Hi,

I'm just wondering if there are forums specifically for webmasters ...
talking about website management, software evaluation, etc.
I'm interested in mailing-lists, newsgroups, or websites.

Please reply by emailing me... I'll summarise the results (if any:-).

Thanks.

Lou's proposal would also allow the same sorts of abilities that my 
State: header would have allowed, specifically the ability to turn 
particular URL's into psuedo-newsgroups for assembly of stream-based

My vote is that Session-IDs are much more tenable than putting miscellaneous
tokens into the URLs--which cause them to fail later.  Those not only
add an implicit state, but they are in effect not "optional" for the
client side, since they are imposed by the server.

This doesn't work outside of the US. For example, companies in the UK
tend to have domain names that end in .co.uk. I don't know if you can
tell merely by syntax what the actual domain of authority is for a DNS
name. 

Is this a necessary feature? If it isn't reliable and can be abused,
it would be best to avoid it.

purpose. All my links are absolute and I must change every occurrence of=

xxx.company.se to yyy.company.se in 200 files ...

Does someone know a MS-DOS/Windows/Windows NT utility which can replace =

Could I ask people participating in this thread to outline the scenarios
that they're thinking of when proposing session-tracking machinery?

Brian did this well in his message that started the thread;  he's interested
in tracking "clickstreams" (first time I'd heard _that_ term...).  Thus he
wants a session-id that identifies a single session but doesn't (I think)
need to maintain state between sessions at different times for the same user.

I'm not sure whether Lou's proposal is meant to solve the same problem or a
larger/different one.

I have a different problem that also uses the label "session".  I inherited a 
system that uses (boo hiss) a session-id in the URL to refer to per-user
server-side state during a single session.  I have good intentions of 
rearchitecting the system in such a way that it can do the same things (in a 
way that's reasonable for the user) without using server-side state, but that 
won't happen tomorrow.  In the meantime I'm stuck with storing a session-id 
somewhere.  I'd much rather move it out of the URL into a request/reply
header, but I need a certain semantics from it.  In particular, it would be
bad if an HTTP proxy ignored the session-id and just gave me back a document 
whose URL matched.  I suspect the answer is "Session-ID: isn't meant to solve
that problem", and maybe "you idiot, you shouldn't even be trying to do that",
but I'd like to at least make sure that we know we're talking about different
things.

This story is sufficiently unlikely and sufficiently harmful that it
should be verified rather than passed on unchecked.  Rumor control,
please?

This is absurd to the point of being unbelieveable.  Has anyone else

     As a follow up to this, I attempted to post this question on the 
     Internet "help" section of CompuServe this morning. When I went back 
     to check for a response I received:
     
     
     Your corporate account has been suspended. If you have any 
     questions, please contact your company's account administrator.
     
     Off at 13:32 EDT 20-Apr-95
     
     Again, I can not confirm if the two are related but found it a little 
     strange.

Ummmm, almost.  400 Bad Request indicates that the server was unable
to understand the request due to it being malformed.  403 Forbidden
indicates that the server *did* understand the request, but refuses to
service it for some reason that remains unknown to the client.

There is a certain amount of overlap between 400 and all 4xx responses,
but I don't consider that to be ambiguous.  I'll change the spec so
that the purpose of the two codes is clarified.

Hmmmm, I could just change the example Reason Phrases to

     400 You screwed up
     403 Piss off

This is another one of those instances where things are sent so fast in
email and blown so quickly out of proportion that the hysteria travels
faster than the sense.  And yet another instance where you all should
think before you forward angry and hysterical rumors as absolute truth. 

I'm on the original list where this was posted, and the author later
claimed that this was a misunderstanding between him and his ex-boss.

And it has also been posted that CIS does have its own WINSOCK which is
installed when you install their software.  But it merely moves your 
original aside so you can put it back if you want to.  It hardly erases  
"all your other browsers."

This is a necessary feature for any large site wishing to make use
of cookies.  Since you often want to run multiple machines this
allows the cookie to be shared among those multiple machines.  For
instance you may want have all your shopping pages an a machine
that only serves static pages and then have the acually buying or
checkout process on another machine that is specifically geared
for cgi processing.

All right - let SPRY comment on this allegation that
The Compuserve browser destroys all other browsers -
or would it simply overlay other versions of the Spry 
browser? Spry was resently acquired by Compuserve
if you were not already aware of this.

For the record, I downloaded WinCIM 1.4 and installed NetLauncher
1.0 (including the Compuserve version of Spry Mosaic) on my machine
which has copies of Spry, Spyglass, NetScape, and NCSA browsers
to no ill effect on any of them.  Maybe I was just lucky?!

However, it does muck with your winsock.dll, since the Dialer which
comes with NetLauncher has its own (part of the value).  I have yet
to find a nice way to have multiple different WINSOCK.DLLs so that I
can use different PPP or LAN TCP implementations conveniently.

I think the rumors about Compuserve's broswer "seeking and destroying"
competitive browsers may be an exagerated translation of the following,
seen on comp.infosystems.www.misc:

Not very friendly, but I wouldn't exactly call my lawyer over it, either.

Well, I just loaded the Compuserve browser on my box with little
side effects.  I have numerous browsers loaded including Mosaic,
Netscape, EMosaic, etc. and none were adversely affected.  What did  
happen - AND THE INSTALL SOFTWARE LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS WAS
HAPPENING - was that all of the winsock.dll's that it could find
were renamed to winsock.000. Matter of fact, if I recall you had to  
click OK for the rename to occur. Unfortunately (or fortunately
depending on your point of view :-) it did not load another
winsock.dll into any of those directories like /windows.  So I
simply renamed all of those winsock.000 back to winsock.dll.

No problems - all of the various browsers that I use were
unaffected by the install.  I do like the Compuserve Browser - ok I  
know that it is Spry Mosaic.  Since compuserve bought Spry, I guess  
they can call it anything they want!

What bothers me about the message is how folks are wanting to sue
at the drop of a hat.  grumble... grumble....

Remember, we're talking about Windows here... never attribute to malice 
that which can be attributed to Bill Gates.  You can mess up the 
configuration on a Windows box doing just about anything.

Anyway, I thought it was Prodigy that was supposed to be the one rooting

I think somehow that the sites have to tell you which cookies they're
willing to take; there's no way that a client should trust site A to
tell it that site B will take it's cookies. Otherwise, malicious site
A might tell the client to send A's cookies to B. This could be done
even in a site that had a common prefix, e.g., user.dorm.bigstate.edu
might start sending bad cookies to administration.bigstate.edu; even
though they had the same double-dot suffix.

Perhaps we need a HTTP reply code 'GIVE COOKIE site', e.g., where the
server says that it is willing to take cookies that were originally
given by the particular site.

Opps, I left part of it out of my proposal.

Only hosts in the specified domain can set cookies for a domain.

Therefore it is not possible to set a cookie for the B domain
unless you are in the B domain.

Thanks all who helped direct my attention somewhere constructive!  (there's
soo much unconstructive but damned interesting stuff out there! hehehe)

here's the bulk of the responce:

http://emwac.ed.ac.uk/html/internet_toolchest/https/contents.htm

if you are looking for a HTTPD server for an NT system, go here.  The emwac
server is simplistic, but it's security seems sound, the logfiles are
complete, and it supports cgi & imagemaps.  (my two biggies, actually)

As I feared.  A cookie hidden in the HTTP headers is not the way to  
implement this!  Just think about it from the customer's point of  
view:  With a real shopping basket, I can see at all times what I've  
collected so far.  I can compare what's there with my budget, and  
with other competitive products that I come across.  As a result of  
my comparisons, I can take products out at any time and put them  
back on the shelf.  Your solution compares poorly with a cardboard  
box :-)

Instead, like any client-side state, the shopping basket makes most  
sense as a document -- something the user can see and act upon.   
And like any association, the relationships tying various "vendor  
stalls" with the associated shopping basket should be established  
using links.

So rather "solving" the problem by adding complicated statefulness  
to HTTP (a future nightmare, in my opinion), a better investment  
would be to think about how to rectify the Web's primitive model for  
linking and navigation of documents -- one of its key strategic  
weaknesses.

P.S.  I'm still in favor of a Session-ID proposed by Brian  
Behlendorf/Dave Kristol, which has the more modest purpose of  
allowing reliable (but not secure) identification of anonymous  
users.

Please excuse this bit of self-promotion, but the
project a small group of us at NTT are working on
is related to this.  We are looking at ways to
automatically form links (not HTML links per se,
but links none-the-less) for the purpose of efficient
searching and improved browsing.  We hope to have
an alpha-version out for medium-scale experimentation
around September, and will be looking for people to
volunteer computer resources to run servers.

Please see:

  This doesn't address larry's second point though does it?  Or am I
misreading this?  Am a bit groggy right now - been up with the new baby

I use some code like this in a page on our server.

The bit of code which detects which browser is being used looks like:

------
$user_agent=$ENV{"HTTP_USER_AGENT"};
$html3_table_support=0;

if ($user_agent=~/Mozilla/) {   # Netscape
    ($version)=($user_agent=~m@Mozilla/([\d\.]*)@);
    if ($version>=1.1) {
        $html3_table_support=1;
    }
} elsif ($user_agent=~/Arena/) { # Arena
    $html3_table_support=1;
} elsif ($user_agent=~/NCSA Mosaic/) { # Mosaic
    ($version)=($user_agent=~m@^.*?/([\d\.]*)@);
    if ($version>=2.5) {
        $html3_table_support=1;
    }
}
------

Currently, this only spots Netscape v1.1 or above, Mosaic v2.5 or
above, or any version of Arena..
(btw - you'll need Perl5 for the non-greedy regexps there)

Just before the data gets printed out, I prepare one of two
templates for a printf:

------
$template="%-23s %5s %-15s %-5s %-25s %5s\n";
$template="<TR>
<TD align=left><P>%s</P></TD>
<TD><P>%s</P></TD>
<TD><P>%s</P></TD>
<TD><P>%s</P></TD>
<TD align=left><P>%s</P></TD>
</TR>\n" if $html3_table_support;
------

Then, this section of code prints out the heading line, if necessary:

------
if (!$head) {
    if ($html3_table_support) {
        print "<TABLE>\n";
        print "<TR><TH ALIGN=left><P>Name</P></TH>\n";
        print "<TH><P>Phone</P></TH>\n";
        print "<TH><P>Last seen when?</P></TH>\n";
        print "<TH><P>Room</P></TH>\n";
        print "<TH><P>Description</P></TH>\n";
        print "</TR>\n";
    } else {
        print "<PRE>\n";
        printf $template, "Name", "Phone", "Last seen when?","Room", "
Description";
        print "\n";
    }
    $head=1;
}
------

To the print the individual rows in the table:

-------
printf $template, ${$info}{"surname"}.", ".${$info}{"forename"},
${$info}{"phone"}, $nicetime, ${$info}{"room"}, $infomsg;
-------

Then, obviously, at the bottom of the table, I close up the <PRE>
or <TABLE> section.

You can see this code in action at 
<URL:http://nuntius.ukc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/abinfo>

Hope this is of use,
  Royston.

Please don't key on the browser name (User-Agent) for this
functionality. The HTTP protocol has included a facility for
format negociation for several years. I hear the Apache group
has implemented it in their revision of the httpd 1.3 server.

Some folks are working on a draft that explains format negociation
in detail... sorry it's not available. For now, please
see the http spec:

http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/HTTP1.0-ID_38.html#HEADING112

Lou's notion of servers issuing cookies can be made to work for session
tracking, but may not work across user sessions. Problems will occur on 
shared machines that do not require logins, i.e. most PC/Macs. So, your 
server issues me a cookie, I use it, leave; later, another user using
the same client and machine visits your site.  While you may be able to 
demarcated sessions, you do not have the same user, who now may have 
inherited a shopping basket, or some other statefull user based 
representation entertained by the server.  Additionally, since cookies need
to be unique, some server side mutex will be necessary, which could turn into
a bottle neck for active servers. Some solutions might include:

   * As Brian proposed, have the cookies cleared upon browser restarts,
     though this conflicts with Lou's goal of having "the client save state
     information within the client."

   * Another would be for start ups of multiuser PC/Mac browsers to ask 
     for some non-informative identification string. I personally 
     do not endorse this method, though it does move in the direction 
     that David Chom posits of multiple, user-defined alias - one can
     be who one wants to be without anyone knowing it's me.

   * Another solution is to restructure one's approach to the problem,
     seeing as multiple goals are trying to be accomplished via one
     mechanism.

Specifically, if seems that we want to accomplish the following three things:

   1) identify sessions from server logs (esp. from firewalled domains)
   2) enable unique, but changeable user identifications
   3) freely pass data as first class objects between client/servers 

The first issue is quite doable without any modifications to existing
protocols (I wrote code a year and half ago, before the referrer field, 
that accomplishes this with a high degree of certainty that the paths 
inferred are the paths actually traveled. See "WebViz: A Tool for WWW 
Access Log Visualization" from the First WWW Conference Proceedings).

The second issue is digital signatures.  Use of Netscape's ip/uid/+* 
based signature, which btw is not very well conceived :(, or some other 
scheme can produce the desired results.  No doubt, better, more robust
schemes exist and will be adopted in the future.  No modification
to HTTP headers are required since From: is already specified.  Note
that use of signatures solves the first issue.

The third issue is first class data passing.  Java is a very strong initial 
starting point.  Multi-part encapsulated MIME for clients and servers could
also be made to fit this problem.  I personally would prefer a separate
protocol as to facilitate modularization and interoperability.  The data
object could be used to contain shopping basket updates and checkouts,
as well as correctly process multi-server shopping malls.

Jim.

I'm wondering if anyone has other options for dealing with multiple language
content management.  The "obvious", but not very appealing, solutions are to
have separate logical content trees, whether on the same server or not, and
whether in parallel directory trees or in the same directories.  A suggestion
was recently made to me that it would be nice if the browsers could select a
"preferred" language, and retrieve that if available, else retrieve the
default.  I know that something similar is already possible with respect to
images, but I don't think it's really used --- the server doesn't send back
the embedded images unless the browser asks for them anyhow.  Thoughts?

  I'm pretty sure you can do this with the cern server via
content-negotiation and the Accept-Language parameter.  I don't have my
docs with me right now though, so I can't check.  Anyone else have any
thoughts?

As a matter of fact, we have!  

-----------------------------

Folks, we in the Apache Group are happy to announce a new public-domain HTTP
server based on patches to NCSA's 1.3 httpd called "Apache".  It fixes many
bugs, in both performance and functionality, and it includes the following
new features: 
 
      Content negotiation (for all you who want to do HTML 3 right!)
      Multiple Domain Names (http://foo.com/ & http://bar.com/)
      Custom error responses (internal redirects to pages or script)
      Send "as is" file types - for including HTTP headers with documents
      More HTTP spec compliance
      DBM-file based user authentication

Currently in version 0.6.2, the server has been tested and is being used 
by HotWired, the movie databases at Cardiff and Msstate, the MIT AI Lab,
Organic, and Hyperreal.  OS's include SunOS, Solaris, SGI, HPUX, and BSDI.

Details are available at <URL:http://www.apache.org/apache/>.  All support
questions should go to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix - it was just
created, so in the meantime use comp.infosystems.www.providers.  Real bug
reports should go to apache-bugs@mail.apache.org. 

It's a beta product so there's guaranteed to be some bugs, but we think we've
given it a pretty good workout.  And remember, you get all the support 
you pay for!

Enjoy.

Ya, we're planning to use Accept-Language in our localized versions
of SCO's forthcoming operating system with a Mosaic-based online
documentation and context-sensitive help system -- called scohelp.

I don't know all of the details, but basically we are laying multiple
language versions of the same doc onto a single server. The client
and server negotiate over Accept-Language and the server tries
to send something appropriate for that language.  I say "tries"
because we decided not to translate some documents.  If the 
specific language requested is not available, then we fall back
to the server's default -- usually, but not necesarily, English.

Cookies make for a very good "cardboard box".  Since they
are fully replaceable you can embed arbitrary information within
them including products for a shopping cart.  When you want to
add another product the server simply adds another cookie or
replaces your current one with another one that represents
an additional product.  The same can be done to remove a product.

Document level information storage fails quite badly at providing that
functionality.
Since the server needs to process the information to make it
usable and since documents don't get resent to servers trying
to embed information in a document doesn't work in practice.
People have tried to embed the information in hidden form
elements and URLs but the systems inevitably have their problems
since alternate navigation mechanisms available to the user
break these systems.

  JP> 
  JP>    1) identify sessions from server logs (esp. from firewalled domains)

I believe this concept is too restricted.  We (I, at least) want to be able
to identify sessions, but doing it from server logs is much too slow.  As
soon as the client connects, I need to know where they came from because
since all my objects are dynamically generated, I can use that information
to customize the current page.  I've thought about doing this via hacked up
URLs, and although I will probably do this on the short term, Session-IDs
are a much cleaner, long-term solution.

It could be argued that what I really want is your third goal:

  JP>    3) freely pass data as first class objects between client/servers 

but I think this is incorrect.  I don't really want to passing the state
information back and forth all the time.  This information could get rather
large, and if I have CPU cycles to burn, I'm willing to store the state
server-side since it will improve performance, and that's of added value to
my customers.

I also think that your claim that:

is flawed.  We're not talking about identifying sessions to some significant
probability; we'd really like to know almost positively.  I don't have time
to look at your paper right now; how well does it performance in caching and
firewall setups (as with the major commericial services (AOL, Prodigy, and
so forth))?

Sorry about the delay in responding - I having been making sure that I can speak 
for SPRY in this matter.  Here's the official scoop:

"There have been rumors on the Internet of CompuServe NetLauncher "destroying" 
other competitive browsers.  This is not true.

CompuServe NetLauncher will not destroy other Web browsers on your machine.  
Instead, it renames existing winsock.dll files in order to shorten the 
installation process for new Internet users. <<That is to say, it will not need 
to add anything to the user's PATH. -Chris>>  When installing NetLauncher, there 
is a dialog box alerting the user that their winsock.dll files will be renamed.  
Following is another dialog box that requires confirmation of their knowledge 
that their WinSock files will be changed.

NetLauncher proceeds to rename the other winsock.dlls to winsock.000, 
winsock.001, etc.  If the user wants to reactivate their other winsocks, all 
they need to do is rename the CompuServe winsock.dll to something else (e.g. 
winsock.cis) and name the desired winsock.00? to winsock.dll."

<end official message>

In addition, some winsock DLLs implement non-standard extensions to the WinSock 
specification, which the applications shipped by some vendors require.  For 
example, the winsock shipped in Windows 95 contains proprietary interface 
components, which means that the winsock shipped with NetLauncher will cause 
some applications (which depend on this proprietary API) to fail to work 
properly.  The winsock shipped with NetLauncher will run all WinSock-compliant 
applications.

   I think we agree.  If the 'From:' field is widely used, you'd have what 
you wanted(1).  My point is that the protocol does not need to be changed to
handle session(1) &/or user identification(2) - WWW browsers/interfaces need 
to pass the right information.  Either way, the passing of an ID still needs 
to accompany each connection & this is exactly the reason I split this thread 
into three issues.  State information(3) is not just session(1) or ID(2)
information and needs to be handled differently.  Again, I think we agree, but 
until the interfaces do things as the protocol specifies, we are left with hacks.

Modified from my previous post:

   1) identify sessions (esp. from firewalled domains)
   2) enable unique, but changeable user identifications
   3) freely pass data as first class objects between client/servers

Absolutely.  The cookie mechanism makes it trivially easy for
the server to generate the page that shows you everything that's
in your shopping basket (cardboard box) and gives you all these
functions at any time -- all the user has to do is click on the icon
"Shopping Basket" at the bottom of every page or in the "menubar",
the client sends the cookie in the request, the server generates
the appropriate page for that cookie, and boom, she gets to see all 
this.  If the session is encrypted, it can be totally safe as well,
without even requiring user identification.

So the neat thing is that we get to use HTML, HTTP, forms, etc.
as they're already defined rather than inventing some huge new
mechanism for storing and presenting "items in a cardboard box"
to be built into every client from here on out.  Cookies provide
the mechanism to leverage the capabilities that are already standard
and assumed in all clients.

>Instead, like any client-side state, the shopping basket makes most  
>sense as a document -- something the user can see and act upon.   

Yup -- that document can be easily generated by the server at
any time and presented to the client.  There's no reason for the
client to have the burden of generating that document or providing
the user with new interaction mechanisms.

Marc

What response code should the server issue to a HEAD request on a 
directory? NCSA gives "302 Found" which must be from an old version of 
the spec, because my 3/8/1995 copy says 302 is "Moved Temporarily".  
Even so, it's nonobvious to me what the response should be.  My best 
guess is 200 OK.

While that might be useful, it would be much more complicated.  In
particular it would complicate what a proxy has to do.  (Wouldn't
a proxy cache need to know which URLs are in which 'realm' and
return a suitable SessionID?  What SessionID would that be?)

The server is certainly free to change the SessionID if a user moves
into a different 'realm', to use your term.

Hi, all !
     
     I visited SYMANTEC's home page yesterday and found this note there:
     
     "We would also like to let you know of the problems some users have 
been experiencing when attempting to use FTP services from a WWW browser. 

Most problems connecting are because of the high traffic being 
experienced on the internet right now in certain domains. Many of them 
are starved for bandwidth, making problems connecting not uncommon. This 
is an internet problem and there is nothing Symantec can do about it. I 
assure you, the server is constantly monitored, and is working properly 
all the time (regular maintenance excluded, of course). 

If you experience these problems trying to connect, we recommend you try 
using different software, both FTP and Web, because some browsers seem 
to "fight" for a connection more aggressively than others (Netscape 
appears to be one of the worst). You can also try connecting from another
domain. The concept of "distance", as it relates to the Internet (this 
is not your physical distance from our building), plays a large part in 
your ability to connect, and another domain may actually have a much 
cleaner connection path".
     
     Well, I have never listened a word about Netscape being "weak" in 
the "fight" for connections.
     Does anybody have something to say about it ???
     
     And what about "try connecting from another domain" ???
     Could anybody tell me how can it be done ???

Note that you can do some clever things which combine both Tables and
<pre>'s, but that's not always sufficient.  We have a package we use that
acts as a "meta-server" and let's you #if your HTML code based on the
browser feature you wish to use (among other things). It acts as an
extension to your existing server. We're considering productizing it if
there is interest.

As I understand (correct me if I'm wrong), that facility let's you
negotiate on a broad scale - e.g. HTML2.0 vs. 3.0 or particular file
formats. That however, is not really the major issue.  We just finished a
site which has some pages which make heavy use of Tables and Forms
(http://www.salemfive.com/salemfive/calcs.html).  We tested it with
Netscape 1.1, Arena .96 and Mosaic 2.5b2. We ended up having conditionals
based on whether the browser supports Tables, whether it supports Tables
within Tables (that crashes/hangs the Cern and NCSA browsers), whether it
supports Forms within Tables and whether it supports Images within Tables.

Content negotiation is certainly necessary, but it isn't sufficient.

Which leads me to another question. Are there any browsers out there that
actually set the Accept fields based on the helper applications?  I know
Netscape doesn't. It makes it rather difficult to determine what formats
can be sent to a browser.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

This is a frustrating problem for content negotiation. It would be very
useful if clients send servers the registered helper MIME types.

We have a server for concept maps that will send the identical map either
as a data structure for our helper tool or as a GIF clickable map.

The functionality is the same in both cases, except that the helper supports
editing and the clickable map does not.

The system was designed to be such that the Accept field determined what
was sent, but currently the effective use of this field does not seem to
be supported by clients.

  Emacs-w3, AIR Mosaic, OmniWeb, and a few others (haven't checked out
  EMosaic for a while, sorry).

  The main problem is not that they set the accept headers wrong (I don't
  think netscape does - are you sure its broken?), but that they do not
  specify the maxsize, maxtime or quality attributes on the frigging
  things.  Which can completely hose things when you then send a */* at the
  end, which netscape and mosaic/X both do.

One has to continually check such things version by version!

I just sent the server a request from Netscape with several additional
MIME types and helpers registered. The request came through as:-

GET /RealEstate/JohnMary.html HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Mozilla/1.1b3 (Macintosh; I; PPC)
Accept: */*
Accept: image/gif
Accept: image/x-xbitmap
Accept: image/jpeg

That is, none of the helper MIME types are listed.

The logic being used seems to be to list only the types that Netscape
itself can display.

It would seem more appropriate to regard helpers as extensions to a
browser and list helper MIME types also.

This will certainly be necessary once we have Open Doc or OLE browsers
where the helper presentations are embedded and indistinguishable from
directly supported types.

It is particularly frustrating with Netwscape currently because its open
architecture enables the helper application to monitor and control
multiple windows and to integrate hypermedia links between them. It is
then a challenge to send clickable maps instead and emulate as much of
the more complex behavior as possible, rather as Lynx does an incredibly
good job of coping with forms.

It would be good to get all the mechanisms for content negotiation
cleanly specified and supported, and helper applications should be a
significant consideration in doing this.

Well, there's a two-sided edge to this question. Go back to some earlier 
browsers, and you'll find that they Accept:ed everything under the sun, 
because they had helpers that could handle it, or they could at least 
save it to disk. I've found that more recent browsers just throw out an 
"Accept: */*" for these cases, and only use a specific Accept browser for 
what they can handle in-line.

This makes sense, really. If you're going to provide an image for an IMG 
tag, you might like to know what image formats the browser can take for 
this position. If the browser gives an "Accept: image/jpeg" because it 
has a helper app that can view it, that can screw up what you're trying 
to do, because you might assume that this means it can handle it in-line 
as well.

Obviously there's a conflict here, but it seems that browser authors (at 
least, the current versions of Netscape and NCSA Mosaic both seem to) 
have decided for the in-line only option. This seems to make sense, not 
to mention the fact that it saves net bandwidth for the request headers - 
only four or five instead of seven zillion.

Note: I don't work for, nor am I affiliated with, any producer of any web 
browser or server whatsoever. I'm just a lonely soul who's spent far too 
much time examining the finer details of the software loaded onto his 
computer and trying to figure out why things work the way they do.

     Emacs-w3, AIR Mosaic, OmniWeb, and a few others (haven't checked out
     EMosaic for a while, sorry).

     The main problem is not that they set the accept headers wrong (I don't
     think netscape does - are you sure its broken?),

I honestly haven't checked 1.0, but the 1.1 betas send the same set
of Accept: headers on any request --- three image/* types and */*.
Not only doesn't this tell you what helper applications are available,
it also gives you no way of knowing whether the browser itself handles
tables or not (a nontrivial issue for those of us who'd like to avoid
a repeat of the forms chaos).

(Arena sends "Accept: text/html; level=3", among other things ---
Apache 0.6.2 uses that to identify tables capability in a client.  You
can see that by looking at http://www.ai.mit.edu; the <pre>-faked
table at the top turns into a real one if you look at it through
Arena). 

     but that they do not
     specify the maxsize, maxtime or quality attributes on the frigging
     things.  Which can completely hose things when you then send a */* at the
     end, which netscape and mosaic/X both do.

Actually, there is a way for a server to fudge this, at least in
simple cases.  The current HTTP draft says that when all available
variants have the same quality (actually q*qs, where qs is the
server's own quality rating for the variant in question), the server
can choose to send any available variant, choosing however it likes.

Apache 0.6.2 uses this freedom to prefer media types which the client
actually named to the ones which just matched a wildcard.  This only
does what you want if all the variants came out with the same
"combined quality" (q*qs), but if they all had the same qs going in,
and the client didn't set quality ratings of its own, that is what you
get.  (I'm to blame for this trick, I guess, having written the Apache
content negotiation code).

However, all is not well, even with this somewhat awkward hack --- if
the client specified no quality values on its Accept: headers (meaning
they all default to 1), and the server knows 'qs' values for the
variants, then the letter of the current HTTP draft requires the
server to always send the variant with the highest 'qs', even if its
media type only matches the */*, and not any of the others.  This
turns setting 'qs' values (which Apache allows, through the *.var
type-map machinery) into a real misfeature.

Things would work a whole lot more sensibly if the quality value on
wildcard Accept: headers defaulted to something low --- say, 0.1.
(This 0.1 would get multiplied into the 'qs' for variants with media
types the client didn't specifically name, which would direct the 
server to choose something else).

Unfortunately, I understand that lowball defaults for 'q' on wildcard
Accept: headers got shot down at the most recent IETF.  Sigh...

Netscape does *seem* to have more problems getting an FTP
link than other tools (ftptool, ncftp, ftp); but that is
only a feeling, not scientific at all.

Also, Netscape (and other browsers) open and close the ftp
connection for each transfer, whereas the standard ftp clients
maintain the control connection for the entire session. This
means that your browser must *fight* the traffic for each directory
listing, file transfer, etc.

Well, I suppose you could telnet somewhere and ftp from there...or
X Netscape back to your display...Hmmm. Ugly, anyway you look at it.

Hi Mike -- the problem is format negotiation. I have services that can
give better interaction if an appropriate helper is installed, but can
still give useful functionality if not. So I need to know at the server
whether the helper application is registered or not. That was the purpose
of the Accept field -- not to say "I accept *.* because I can dump it in
a file regardless of whether that file is usable or not."

It's like a lot of HTML/HTTP, what was intended has never been defined,
and I guess Roy Fielding's work on defining HTTP is where we should look for
clarification. The debate on www-talk at least demonstrates that there
are 2 schools of thought (if not more!).

I guess what hasn't been clear in what I've said is that it is MY helper
app that may, or may not, be at the client end. If it is there I can provide
more functionality. If not, I can still provide a viable service.

A good example is our concept mapping tool acting as a helper to Netscape.
It manages graphs of nodes and arcs and uses these to navigate hypermedia
structures. The tool can act as a helper but on Macs only currently. For
clients on other platforms it can act as a server sending the same material
in clickable maps.

Currently the URL determines what is done, but I'd prefer to do content
negotiation and just check the Accept field to see if the MIME type
supported by the helper is available.

WWW clients are becoming more and more open architecture so that the helpers
appear as seamless, functional part of the client to an end-user. It is
logical to pass info about helper MIME types in the Accept field.

For some background on what we are doing, see the report at:

  http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/articles/ConceptMaps/

sections 11 and 12 illustrate the issues above.

  If a browser does this, it is _WRONG_.  For an inlined image request, a
  client should only send the types it can handle inline.  Emacs-w3 does
  this for its images and mpegs, and AIR Mosaic does this for images as
  well.

  And you should really only ever send */* if you know you are dumping to
  disk.

  So netscape can't do inlined HTML then, eh?  If all it sends are:

Accept: image/gif
Accept: image/jpeg
Accept: image/xbm
Accept: */*

  Then a server should lump text/plain, application/postscript, text/rtf,
  application/x-ms-word, and text/html all with the same rating, and is
  free to send whichever it wants.  And application/x-ms-word would be the
  'best' one to most servers.

  I'd consider that a bad thing as a server guy. :)  And I'm sure the
  client user wouldn't like it either.

Hello there.

I just found out that there is a server called the "Apache."  I've got to 
wonder whether the people who are developing this server have contacted 
the Apache nation to find out whether it is ok to use their name.

It is, unfortunately, common practice to use names of American Indian 
nations as if they were mytical or historical -- like "The Trojans."  
However, there are real people involved here -- who have a culture and 
the right to be treated with dignity.  Indigenous peoples, in 
particular, have had so much stolen from them -- their land, their 
culture, even some of their spiritual traditions -- that it seems 
particularly important to be sensitive about using their name as well. 
It is possible that the Apache nation would be proud to have a server 
named after them, but it would seem proper to ask -- if this hasn't 
been done already.

Yours,

Steve Habib Rose

  I don't know about the code in netscape, but the stock libwww from CERN
  has _always_ cached the control connection.  Emacs-w3 uses ange-ftp or
  efs to do the ftp work, and they also cache the connection.

Does anyone know of a good graphical PPP/SLIP Web browser for MS-DOS?  
The Windows ones give me nothing but trouble.  I'm hoping to get LINUX 
within the next few weeks, but this would be to tide me off til then 
(I've been using Lynx via my host's UNIX shell).

I dunno - this is like NBC saying "well, there are some brands of TV's 
out there that can't do NTSC completely, so we're going to have to make 5 
different versions of the NBC Nightly News to compensate".  Broken 
browsers are broken browsers, whether they're in beta or not, and the 
only way to convince broken browser authors to fix them is to not cater 
to the bugs in their code.  Eventually we'll have a web where the most 
popular browsers are not the experimental ones.

Yes, content negotiation works in an environment where browsers don't lie 
about their capabilities, or if they do their users can live with the 
consequences.  Look at all the effort you spent in determining what 
browsers can do what - are you going to keep this list updated?  When you 
set a conditional that "All versions of NCSA Mosaic for Windows don't 
support tables in forms", how long does it take for your table can be 
updated when a new one does?  Believe me, I sympathise and admire the 
effort, we had to do it at HotWired, but eventually I just gave up (it 
was probably when I had trouble with HTML in the quoted value sections of 
hidden form fields with some browsers).

Actually, I think NetScape does it as close to correctly as any other 
browser - the HTTP spec says (at 
<URL:http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/HTTP1.0-ID_24.html#HEADING36>):

  5.4.1 Accept 

  The Accept header field can be used to indicate a list of media ranges
  which are acceptable as a response to the request. The asterisk "*"
  character is used to group media types into ranges, with "*/*" indicating
  all media types and "type/*" indicating all subtypes of that type. The set
  of ranges given by the client should represent what types are acceptable
  given the context of the request. The Accept field should only be used
  when the request is specifically limited to a set of desired types (as in
  the case of a request for an in-line image), to indicate qualitative
  preferences for specific media types, or to indicate acceptance of unusual
  media types. 

  (lots more interesting stuff)

It's not entirely clear whether Accept: should be used just for inline
objects or for all possible objects that can be sent to external
applications.  NetScape sends */*, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg,
which besides */* is all it can inline (at least my X version - the windows 
version might send image/x-bmp or the mac image/pict or something).  When
NetScape's browser can handle inline PDF I hope they send application/pdf
- and now that they're doing tables we wish they'd send text/html;
version=3.0 (or at least 2.1, maybe, if that's what was decided in
Darmstadt :( ).  Other browsers are much worse with their Accept: headers,
yes, even Arena (c'mon, guys, why the application/x-island-paint,
application/x-island-draw, and application/x-island-write??).

A couple of recommendations for WWW browser authors:

1) First and foremost, set accept headers for all data types that your
browser can inline, with high q values if needed (default is 1).  And if
your implementation of experimental data types (HTML 2.1 or 3.0) is such
quality that you are billing it as a feature to your clients, specify that
in your headers with the appropriate q levels. 

2) On most platforms the number of data types that can be sent to 
external applications is much smaller than the default .mailcap files 
might suggest.  The browser should determine, based on a simple test for 
the existance of those applications listed in the default and user 
mailcaps, which mime types can really be passed off, and include those in 
the headers with small q values.

3) Allow the user to configure the q values and create new mailcap mapping
within the browser's preferences settings. 

4) Enable use of the "mxb" setting, so that people can determine the
maximum amount of information they're willing to accept for a given type 
of object, and the provider can scale what they provide accordingly.  No 
more "click here for a lower resolution version of the home page"!  The 
user can say "I really would prefer 50K or less for each HTML access", 
then the server can pump out a page with smaller inline images.  Apache 
doesn't support this yet, but just wait.... (or maybe it does?  Rob T.?)
Better yet, someone could say "I really only want MPEG movies below 2 
megs" and the server can scale the data accordingly.  

Guys, this is *all*in*the*current*specs*.  All these proposals are
designed to give the users more power in expressing their preferences and
abilities.  Content providers are dying to be able to meet their needs. 

	Brian

Haha.  We ran into this as well with Apache - it seems some clients would 
rather get "mother.gif" than "mother.html".  :)

So, the server at least presumes "text/html; q=1" and "text/plain; q=1" if 
neither are explicitely mentioned.  Of course, that may result in a bad 
response to a VRML-only browser.....

That's fine. The behavior of a helper for the x-kss MIME type we've defined
for concept maps is well-defined. Maybe one day it will graduate into a
registered MIME type. We can expect plenty of helper apps with experimental
or semi-proprietary MIME types in future. The assumption is that the MIME
type defines what the data means to a helper.

   Haha.  We ran into this as well with Apache - it seems some clients would 
   rather get "mother.gif" than "mother.html".  :)

   So, the server at least presumes "text/html; q=1" and "text/plain; q=1" if 
   neither are explicitely mentioned.  Of course, that may result in a bad 
   response to a VRML-only browser.....

Actually, that got deleted at Roy's insistence (the default specified
in the HTTP draft is *strictly* */*, if no explicit Accept: headers
are present, and that's what I went with).  If someone actually does
specify a type map (either explicitly or through a MultiViews request
for 'mother' where mother.gif and mother.html both exist), well, they
get what they get.

(Fortunately, enabling content negotiation won't ever break existing
links by serving up the wrong variant in cases like this, since
existing links always point directly to one of the variants --- always
to 'mother.gif' or 'mother.html', whichever is required, and never
just to 'mother', which gets bounced with a file not found unless
MultiViews is enabled and the server is allowed to cruise the
directory for possible variants).

This does indeed have the awkward consequences Brian outlined above,
but that's not *nearly* as awkward as what you get by defaulting 'q'
on */* to 1.0 if not specified otherwise (see previous message for a
description of those... glitches).  It has, at times, been a little
tempting to vary a bit from the strict letter of the standard for
cases like these (under control of some sort of config directive), but
I wanted to get the standard case right first.

You and I understand that - but they VP at the bank that's paying for the
site is less likely to - and he's paying the bills. Also, practically I
believe that there always will be browsers with custom features - it's a
competitive advantage to do so. Expecting them to all standardize is rather
like expecting Unix vendors to unify - back in my Motif days I used to
think that would happen too -- no longer.

It's not an issue of lying, Netscape doesn't claim to support 3.0, for
instance, it just claims to support some varition of some features in 3.0.
Since HTTP doesn't give them a way of saying *which* features, the job ends
up in my court.

That's a problem I'm working on right now. We're in the process of setting
up a browser-feature tracking service for designers.  I hope to send out
mail about it in a week or so.  Yes, keeping the tables up-to-date is a
problem, but so long as a browser doesn't *remove* a feature, it isn't
super critical if there is some lag.

That's for sure. Just figuring out which audio format to send to a given
browser/platform has been a royal pain, never mind the quality issue.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

Hi, 

Does anyone know if the NCSA httpd documentation server,
hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu, has been permanently removed from service? If so
is there any site maintaining the NCSA httpd docs? 

Thanks,

We didn't contact them. We thought about possible problems of the name,
but decided we shouldn't worry.

The Apache server is free, nobody's exploiting the name for profit, at
the expense of the Apache people.

I'm sure if we called it the "English", "Welsh", "French"... server,
none of those nations would feel hurt in any way. Why should the 
Apache feel any different ?. Suggesting they might feel differently
is probably a bigger insult to them than using the name.

I use language encoding of files at www.luth.se in a way that would let a
language-aware client request a document in a specific language. It is
done by having suffixes express the content-language. I don't know the
CERN_httpd source code by heart by I recall it having quite extensive
routines to really handle content and encoding negotiation.

Today I use these suffixes primarily as a comfortable way to name different
versions of a document. The language specification in the HTTP-reply is
today only a nice side-effect as it seems to be ignored by all common clients.

I won't go into detail about how it's done unless someone really wants
me to. I recommend that anyone interested in this reads the documentation:

The only sites that I have encountered that Netscape fails
on are ones that have broken PASV implementations.  These
sites are in violation of the RFC so there isn't much
I can do about that.  If you know of any sites that fail
please email me with the address.

Other browsers do that, but not Netscape.  Netscape reuses
FTP control connections whereever possible.  It is sometimes
necessary to sever a control connection but in most cases
it is reused.

Note that there are good quality factors for the HTML formats. I had 
thought it sent out the stuff from /usr/local/lib/mailcap too, but 
obviously not; a pity. Notice also the q factor for */*

It is difficult to see how a single q factor could effectively resolve
a situation with GIF and JPEG both available; JPG is better for many 
pictures, but GIF is better for some. Ah well, notice I have x-png 
in there :)

There are some wierd and non-standard accept lines in there, because 
the .mailcap was generated by metamail, which tries to understand 
sun mailtool stuff as well as MIME. Really I need more granularity 
than a single file for all applications.

Content negociation could be sufficient, if folks banded together
and supported it consistently.

If you want to stay "bug for bug compatible" from now until eternity,
that's your perogative.

But I suggest that the long-term solution is to follow the specs
(and get them revised when they're not complete) and urge browser
implementors to fix their stuff. There are enough commercially
supported browsers now that nobody has to rely on unsupported
software for anything critical.

Have you reported the defect to CERN and NCSA (by the way... what's
the "CERN browser"? Do you mean the linemode browser or Arena?)

Amen. Some folks are working on an internet draft to clarify format
negociation in practice.  I think. (Anybody who's working on it want
to chime in? Anybody else want to volunteer?)

   From: Steve H Rose <habib@world.std.com>

   Hello there.

   I just found out that there is a server called the "Apache."  I've got to 
   wonder whether the people who are developing this server have contacted 
   the Apache nation to find out whether it is ok to use their name.

Well, it's not just us (a "whois apache" finds all sorts of people),
but this is an issue, and it's one we've discussed.  The bottom line
for us was whether, say, the Jewish members of the group would be
deeply offended by another piece of software named, say, Torah,
Israel, Talmud, Mitzvah, or whatever --- and, provided there was
nothing deeply offensive about the way it was presented, we wouldn't.
(What sort of Jewish name is "Thau", you ask?  Let's just say Ellis
Island was a pretty weird place).

Of course, it's entirely possible that the real Apaches are more
sensitive to this sort of thing than we are, and if so, we'll change
it --- but we would prefer to hear it from the Apaches themselves.  We
really don't mean to offend.

(BTW, there already is a fair amount of native American related
information on the Web --- see Yahoo for a good list of starting
points (yes, they have *everything*) --- but if some worthy Amerind
organization needs a little Web space, and this goes particularly for
the Apache Nation of course, we may be able to help).

Alright, I'll concede that - in fact that makes the inline vs. external

Because I'd rather dish valid HTML3 to browsers that at least make a stab 
at trying to understand it rather than lie and label a page with tables as 
HTML2 and have perfectly legal HTML2 browsers barf.  But I guess that's 
academic.

I have no way of displaying those data types!  Those weren't listed in my
.mailcap, nor in the system-wide mailcap, and I don't have those
applications on my system.

Hmm... to some level this seems a user-interface question as much as a 
technical one.  You're right in that I may want to be able to change that 
mxb factor quickly to compensate for slower links or objects I really 
want to see.  What if instead of mxb we used a global q factor of some 
sorts, which the browser implemented as a slider in the menu bar.  The 
definitions of how q values mapped to sizes would be up to the content 
provider... which is fine, as sites that insist on sending me 500K gifs 
when my slider is at .1 will just disappear from my hotlist.

HTTP-NG could enable users to change this q factor on the fly - combine 
that with MPEG compression boards and.....

The resolution of which type to send should only be based on per-type q 
factors, not mxb, it would seem to me.

Well, some of our servers support it but the firewalls block attempts at 
incoming connections to arbitrary ports.  I've never had a problem with 
the PORT command working, tho.  Why do you use PASV instead of PORT?

It is the recommended method of RFC 1579 "Firewall-Friendly FTP".
It allows most users behind a firewall to use FTP without
socks or a proxy.

            For UNIX, a path search of mailcap files is specified.   The
            default  path  search is specified as including at least the
            following:

            $HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap

            However,  this  path  may  itself  be  overridden  by a path
            specified by the MAILCAPS environment variable.

What puzzles me is -- why is the server involved in this at all?   
Why are we developing a complex stateful protocol to handle what  
amounts to the customer's private (until the final purchase decision  
is made) musings?

It's only the lack of serious client-side capabilities in today's  
Web that's keeping you from thinking about this as the client-side  
issue it naturally is.  Shouldn't we be devoting the effort  
currently going into server-side kludges (I've done my share of  
this) to improving the client capabilities?  From what I hear, Billy  
G. understands and fully intends to exploit this weakness of the  
Web...

Not quite.  You're relying on what *I* would consider a "huge new  
mechanism" -- adding complex statefulness to HTTP.  This is about as  
far from HTTP "as it's already defined" as you could get.  As the  
first two sentences of the spec say, "HTTP...is a generic,  
stateless, object-oriented protocol..."  And because the proposed  
mechanism, despite its complexity, is specialized to serve only a  
narrow range of stateful applications, I believe that its costs will  
outweigh its benefits in the long run.

Rising to the bait, though, can there be any question that client  
capabilities need to be expanded significantly?  (Judging from  
Netscape's well-considered moves announcing support for PDF and  
VRML, there wouldn't seem to be much debate.)  People see that the  
Web is cool -- but they also see that as an interface, it is still  
far from matching up to the ease of use of the prosaic software they  
use every day.  So we *do* have a huge task ahead of ourselves,  
whether we are prepared to acknowledge it or not.  And shopping  
baskets would be only a small part of the fallout of doing this  
well.

It's a 302 redirect because NCSA autoredirects directory URLs without
a trailing slash to a URL with a trailing slash to maintain the
integrity of links.

I see a use for it - where a company has web servers on a.company.com, 
b.company.com and c.company.com and wants to track sessions amongst all 
them.  However, the ".co.uk" example does blow that out of the water, and 
the simpler model (one where the client has a persistant session-ID) 
allows for this anyways.  What if "domain" were "other-hosts" where an 
access to a.company.com resulted in a response that specified 
b.company.com and c.company.com as other places the session-ID should be 
used at?  Or a regular expression, like "*.bt.co.uk"?

If you read the Apache FAQ, you'll see why the name was picked.

LANL projects are named after pseudo-random acronyms, at least
that's the way I see it.

	Hello all,

	I've been reading some papers and articles about how to
increase the performance of Web Servers.  Specifically,  looking
in the direction of caching and "long-lived" connections as pointed out in the
paper "Improving HTTP Latency" by V. N. Padmanabhan (UCB) and J. C. Mogul
(DEC).

	Is there any way in the current (or future direction of the standard)
to tell a server to keep the connection open, since I will be coming to you
again soon ??? 

	This paper mentions the use of Pragmas, but the only Pragma that I
now of is "no-cache".

	Thanks for any insight you can offer,
	greg

How Do I Love Thee, Let Me Email The Ways
 ------------------------------------------
   Here's a great bit for your show, courtesy of the Internet.  If you
point your World Wide Web browser to:

                  http://www.nando.net/toys/cyrano.html

you will encounter CYRANO.  Cyrano is a Valentine server which allows
you to instantly create Valentines to send by email.  You can select one
of several tones for your Valentine:  Steamy, Intellectual, Friendly,
etc. plus you can personalize it.  Now, if you just instruct the serve
to mail them BACK to YOU, you will wind up with as many
computer-generated Valentines as you want.  This is a great way to come
up with Valentines for famous people or characters on your show.  Here
are two examples.  The first one I created from Clinton TO Hillary using
the "steamy" mode.  The second one I created for someone on my show who
plays a hick character.  I used the "friendly" mode on that one.  The
computer asks for a couple of words and then does all the work:


Dearest Hillary,

My love, I can imagine myself kissing your Political body and slathering
you with various oils and burger & fries. Your ever-changing hairstyles
are my anchor in the stormy sea of life; I wonder how I ever made it
through a day without you.  Please meet me dressed in your American Flag
on Valentine's Day and we will celebrate our hot love together.

Yours presidentially,
Bill Clinton


Dear Betty Bodine,

My love, I think I like you but I am not sure about our friend
relationship.  I do like your armpits and the sight of you in your
overalls is better than TV, no, I mean even better than the Internet.
In fact, I will give up netsurfing for a Hick-like evening with you. I
will bring the frogs and you can bring the fries. Or maybe we will go
out. Or maybe you will decide.

Yours greasy,
Corey Deitz

>From the RadioPrep List:
 ------------------------
  (This comment originally appeared on the RADIOPREP list.  I thought it
was very interesting.)

     We are in the early stages of having the audience participating in
the show via e-mail.  Two things appear to be happening.  The first is
this "silent majority" who choose not to use the phone to participate in
the program. These are people we've obviously never heard from before.
Some of their e-mail is pretty hip.  I respond to each piece of e-mail
and invite them to call.  Some do.  I've also noticed some of the
regular callers have switched over to e-mail as their method to
communicate with the show. They've been  replaced by a whole new group
of people on the phones.  Maybe it's the moon and the stars.

We also encourage the audience to stop by the studio.  Now, consider the
fact that we are in a downtown office building..THEY COME.  Some call
ahead...others just stop by.  How many?  Perhaps one a week.  It doesn't
get old and it adds the element of the surprise to the program.  A
couple of times we've put the "live" studio people on the phones with
callers.  I just sit back.  We've had "moments."

The bottom line is that we have positioned the morning show as bigger
than life - without the arrogant attitude you hear on some shows.  WE
ARE YOU is what we communicate to the audience.  It's not the "we're in
show business and you're not" attitude that bubbles underneath some
morning programs.

So far, it's working BIG for the show and the radio station.

Pardon for bringing up an old subject:

A while back, I asked for information on Host Hiding in an URL 
(i.e. serving multiple domains from the same web server).
Someone was kind enough to post an URL for a sample site, complete
with instructions for modifying the 'ifconfig' on your server, and
the ncsa httpd server patches.  I *think* the URL had something
like "two-hosts" in it.  I've tried various combinations of URL's, but
cant find my way back.  (I KNOW I had a bookmark, but it's gone...).
I checked the www-talk hypermail archives, and found two references
to rel\plies, but the server (where the hypermail archives are) returned
an error 404 - Not Found, when I tried to access the articles!

I need this information FAST! Could someone PLEASE (see me, I'm on
my knees begging now!) re-post that URL for the 'two-servers' ?

TIA!

Could anyone describe the pros and cons of various systems (operating 
system, hardware/software, connections, etc.) for setting up a Web Server 
for home or office.

Is a mac better than windows NT or Sparcstation?  For the office we have 
direct access to the internet and we have one Sparcstation 20 and one Sparc 
5.  We may or may not be able to use those for internet apps.  Should be 
purchase another Sparc or buy a mac...windows NT?

For the home what would be best?


Thanks,

The best is to set up a Web server in the environment you have knowledge=
  =20
in.
We decided to run our server on Windows NT just because we know  this OS=
.

I don't think Windows NT is better or worse than Mac or Sparc as a WWW  =
=20
server. They are all the same - you write your HTML pages and they are  =
=20
loaded irrespective of the server environment.

For your home - that's the same as above. Do you have a leased line to  =
=20
your home?
At home most persons are running Windows, so I'll suggest Windows 95 and=
  =20
the WebSite server. More info about WebSite can be loaded from  =20
http://dc3.alisa.com/ (this is Robert Denny's, (the author of WebSite)  =

Please follow up this if you don't agree ...

Do the browser developers among you have a feeling for
the extent to which you will be supporting the LANG and
CLASS attributes in upcoming browsers?

How about supporting the ID attribute in other than anchor
tags?

it is passed the header by the client during a request, it should return 
that header as part of the response.  Clients, meanwhile, after receiving 
that header from a specific server, need to pass that header to that server 
on subsequent requests.  The actual HTTP server code remains stateless while 
clients gain only minimal statefulness (since the header value is a magic 
cookie).  CGI scripts that use that header (the "stores"), are, however, 
fully stateful.

Client-side capabilities should be expanded in my view (as you can see from 
my previous postings).  The "magic cookie" approach requires minimal server 
and client code changes, while enabling a new class of Web applications. 
 Full, safe client-side scripting like that of Safe-Tcl's for mail will open 
many new classes of Web applications.

I don't think HTTP, with or without cookies, will ever be suitable for
electronic shopping. In the physical world, products are scarce, and
when one customer puts it in his basket, nobody else can get it
anymore. You need not just a stateful protocol, but a permanent
connection: if the customer leaves the shop without paying, then you
can put the product back on the shelf. A magic cookie is like an
indefinite claim: if the customer is allowed to take it home with him,
you'll never know if he's planning to buy it eventually or not.

I'm writing an article about the Web for a magazine called
"Computers in Physics".

Sure I can talk about the different browsers and sites, but
I'd like to get some perspective on the historical attitude of
the Web's designers towards supporting physics on the Web:

As I understand it (and I'm hoping you all will tell
me if I'm wrong -- that's why I'm posting here) the Web was
originally designed to help the high-energy physicists at CERN to
collaborate with others across the net. The original browser 
allowed annotation of documents, so that the Web was suited to
joint authorship of documents rather than publishing (two-way 
communication rather than one-way).
   But the first NCSA Mosaic didn't offer annotation. It
did offer a sufficiently spiffy GUI that use of the Web 
for entertainment and tech support (and marketing) has exploded.
Which is fine, but the current version of HTML and currently
available tools leave some things to be desired for 
disseminating physics information over the Web: like 
support for tables, Greek letters, and math symbols.
   Future versions of HTML may help, but meanwhile the 
dominant Web culture seems to have other priorities (not
least of which appears to be turning HTML into a page 
description language, and making secure connections). Also
HTML appears to be becoming Balkanized (I'm thinking about
the features supported only by Netscape and about Mathbrowser),
so who knows what'll happen to future development of HTML?

So what is a physicist to do? At the moment, I can 
collaborate via e-mail and run latex2html to get in-line GIFs,
but that's really not optimal. I haven't tried Mathbrowser
-- I'd like to talk by email with anyone who has. 

Also, I'd like to know what's cooking now that might 
benefit physicists in general?

Not necessarily.  There was a mountain of oranges at the supermarket last 
night.  Now, in the case of something like that ultra-rare Jesus Jones 
remix album from Japan I picked up the other night from Tower, yeah, 
that's a situation where being able to put the product in my hand 
reassured me that no one else would get it before I did - but the greater 
reassurance was that I wouldn't leave the store without forgetting to buy 
it.  Scarcity is a difficult thing to handle in any remote shopping 
situation - how many times have you watched the Home 
Shopping Club and seen "order now!  We've only got three of 'em!"  
The market will find a solution for this.  As long as the shopping cart 
application allows the user to buy things as soon as they want, it's not 
a problem.

Sounds like we're trying to get a little too literal here.  "put the 
product back on the shelf"?  If all the user is saving is a URL to the 
object... anyways, internet shopping is going to be fundamentally 
different from in-store shopping or phone ordering or infomercials or 
anything, and the "shopping cart" metaphor was not meant to imply we 
should build a system that exactly duplicates the in-store shopping 
experience.  

Though, the problem of putting objects "on hold" could be pretty easily 
handled with some simple CGI scripts.

One reason for involving the server, and not the client, is that only
the server knows the nature and content of the information it's sending
out.  Otherwise, each time a vendor discovers another interesting use
of WWW, it will either have to bend the application to fit existing
clients (still possibly true, I guess), or start shipping a custom,
special-purpose client.

Suppose I'm interested in the use of a Session-ID as a way to simplify
a magazine subscription service.  The Session-ID constitutes (no
surprise) a way to track a "session", something you can't do easily
with a stateless protocol.  In my case, it can track where you are in
the service hierarchy and that you've authenticated yourself.  It can
also carry expiration information.  I wouldn't want to have to wait
until all the client vendors had picked up the set of magazine
subscription extensions (along with the shopping basket extensions)
before I could offer such a service.

It seems to me we have the choice of creating either client-side or
server-side kludges.  Putting the kludges in the server makes the
software distribution problem simpler and makes it easier to start up
new services.  All it takes is a little cooperation from a client.
Hence my earlier proposal for a very simple Session-ID mechanism, and
my general support for simple, general mechanisms in the protocol.

Now, if only browsers would actually do that... instead, we have hacks on
top of hacks on top of hacks, and nobody dares implement the real spec
because so many broken clients will cause it to behave in unreasonable
ways.  Most urgent is to put a quality value that is less than 1 on
the type */*, unless the client really does mean to say that it can display
every content-type in the entire world completely losslessly.

>> 3) The quality factor for each listed type should be user-editable via

I've long wanted there to be a quality parameter in mailcap files to allow
specification of exactly that.  The syntax is pretty simple (just
"quality=value") and I think somebody would probably be fairly safe in
implementing it that way.

The quality value is likely an aspect of the viewer used and the hardware
configuration; I don't think it's something users should have cluttering
up their preferences screen.

Here's how I suggested phrasing the spec.  Don't remember what ever happened
to it.
--
The "quality" field specifies the degradation factor associated
with the view-command for this rule.  The value must be a number in
ANSI-C floating point text representation ranging from 1.0 (no
degradation) to 0.0 (total degradation.)  This value should be assumed
to apply to the print command, too, if it exists.  If the quality
field is absent, a default value of 1.0 may be assumed.  Note that
this field SHOULD NOT be considered to override the use of the first
matching mailcap entry.
 
This field has the same semantics and syntax as the "q" parameter for
Accept: headers in HTTP requests {cite the draft for HTTP from the Tim
BL and the IIIR WG} and is primarily intended for use by WWW clients.
However, mail readers may use its value for other quality decisions;
for example, a reader might warn the user not to expect much before
invoking rules with a very low quality, or check whether the
sender-arranged ordering of body parts in a multipart/alternative
entity contradicts quality comparisons.

I like to think we've gotten close with Apache.... certain presumptions 
were made (an implicit text/html; q=0.5) to account for broken 
(excuse me, all :) browsers.

Why shouldn't the mime-type fields in the mailcap entries look exactly 
like the Accept: headers (i.e., why "quality" instead of "q"?).

Er, I dunno, my TV at home does a pretty cool job of giving me control over
certain things (contrast, tint, etc) without looking cluttered.  q factors
are something that the user might want to change - I'm really interested in
reading the New York Times (and other publications that offer PDF files as
alternatives to HTML) exactly as it looks on paper, so I'll set my
application/pdf setting to 1.0.  The browser might even be smart 
and group settings by major type and let me set them relatively - i.e.
presents me with a list of all video formats I can see, and I can say 
"well I'd really prefer mpeg over quicktime" so it'd set mpeg to 1.0 and 
quicktime to 0.9, avi to 0.8, etc...  this really could be quite a 
powerful mechanism.

Good, but I still think "q" should be used.  Isn't this really a MIME 
issue?

Well, because "quality" seems to fit better with the other parameters already
in mailcap files (things like "compose", "test", "description" and "print")
while "q" does not mean anything out of context.  What's the advantage
to "q"?

Things brings up the interesting split: the q parameter is intended to
express lossiness of presentation, not user preferences.  Overloading it
has some interesting implications (e.g. most people might prefer to use
JPEG over GIF, but really it depends on how the image originated, since
converting a GIF to a JPEG for transmission will make it worse, not better.)

Yes, it is; the change would be to the mailcap spec.  Mind you, since
most existing browsers that attempt to use mailcaps get it wrong, I'm not
sure how pronounced the effect would be. :-)

Ah, okay, I didn't realize that the mailcap spec and the mime-type spec 
where so discontiguous (that was brilliant).

According to 
<URL:http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/HTTP1.0-ID_38.html#HEADING112>:

q
     The quality factor chosen by the user agent (and configurable by the 
     user) that represents the desirability of that media type. In this 
     case, desirability is usually a measure of the clients ability to 
     faithfully represent the contents of that media type to the user. 
     The value is in the range [0,1], where the default value is 1. 

How does the browser determine "the clients ability to faithfully represent
the contents of that media type to the user"?  The best the client could do
would be 0 or 1.  I might have a much better WAV player than MPEG player, but
I'd much prefer to get MPEG streams given that I know they pack higher
quality per byte.  At some level, the user should have control over this. 

In a general sense, overall "quality" shouldn't be mapped directly to 
media types, I agree.  The only thing that really maps to quality is 
bandwidth in most cases - so an overall "Accept-Quality" header might be 
needed (implemented as a slider replacing the throbbing N at the top of 
my browser :) that the server uses to determine what to send.

   Now, if only browsers would actually do that... instead, we have hacks on
   top of hacks on top of hacks, and nobody dares implement the real spec
   because so many broken clients will cause it to behave in unreasonable
   ways.  Most urgent is to put a quality value that is less than 1 on
   the type */*, unless the client really does mean to say that it can display
   every content-type in the entire world completely losslessly.

Note how having the server default quality to less than one on */*
conveniently solves this problem...

  But what about a browser that is ultra-configured, and really _CAN_
display every type and its grandmother with no lossage whatsoever?  Servers
should make assumptions like this, no matter if they are justified at the
moment.  Browser authors should get off their !#%!#@ and do it right.

Depends on your perspective. Servers written for Windows or the MAC tend to be 
much simpler to configure and get on line. If you have a server that is 
expecting heavy traffic however (50,000+ hits per day) there's no substitution 
for a UNIX platform.

First, sorry if this is some kind of a FAQ or has been debated here before...

I was looking at Web page yesterday, when Netscape (1.1 mac) suddenly
started to download a new page by itself. I thougth that I had clicked on a
link by mistake, but this repeated several times without my intervention.
Very annoying, because I hadn't time to read the first page before the
second came.

Today again, when I looked at interesting web page, Netscape started to
download an audio file and started talking to me. Cute, but very annoying,
as it did it over and over again, every time I had resized the Netscape
window (over the slow Atlantic link USA->Sweden). If I wanted to get to a
new page I first had to check the dialog "stop dowload" to get there.

I had to take a look at the HTML source to find out what this was, and I
found a new HTML directive looking something like this:

<META HTTP-EQUIV=REFRESH CONTENT="20; URL=http://[file name].au">

I presume this tells Netscape to download the audio file 20 seconds after
the page has been loaded.

This is AWFULL - this means that the time when *you* choose what you want
so see on the web is gone! TV-style advertising is entering the Web!

Is this nuicance going to be a part of the proposed HTML v 3.0 or is it a
Netscape specific extension?
Is there a way to turn it off in Netscape, or is the only way to get rid of
it to start using a non-advertising browser?

And a more general comment:
How's the net going to cope with the load and where is the web going to end
up if clients start to drag down stuff you haven't asked for?
Is network TV with built-it shopping facilities what we want?

Ulf

Looks like that.

The <META...> element is legal HTML 3.0, and the HTTP-EQUIV attribute
also.  Its purpose is to add HTTP headers, for example

<META HTTP-EQUIV=Expires CONTENT="Sat, 6 May 1995 12:00:00 GMT">

creates the following HTTP header:

Expires: Sat, 6 May 1995 12:00:00 GMT

However, AFAIK, there is no such thing as a `Refresh' header.

I am pretty sure that this is Netsc[r]ape-spectific.  I haven't found it
in the IETF HTTP drafts, and I have to agree with Ulf Kronman that such a
behaviour is evil, rude and nasty.

This means that Netscrape does not only add shitty extensions to their
browser, but also to their *server* which is much, much worse!

I fear this is the only solution.

It will collapse.  It will die horribly.  Netscrape is kiling off the
Net.  It is a plague that ought to be avoided.

The Web will live without Netscrape, or it won't live at all!

I connected to Netscape's server to see if this was true (or documented).
It is both (http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/dynamic_docs.html).
In the words of the documentation: "the content creator has total control".

Presumably that means control of what gets downloaded to the user. I wish
it meant that they also had control over themselves. Perhaps a little
control should be put back in the users hands, e.g., a preference which
would alert them to, or disable "dynamic documents."

The postive uses of this (e.g. real dynamic data) will be great. The
negative...this will change surfing the net, that's for sure.

What Netscape needs to add is an option whereby dynamic documents are 
normally turned off, but the browser can (again optionally) ask the user, 
"This is a dynamic document.  Dynamic document support is disabled. 
 Re-enable for this document? (y/n)".  There are whole classes of 
applications that could be implemented with this; unfortunately, 
"TV/radio-like advertising" is one of them.  This option is needed *NOW* to 
reduce the chance that the Web will turn into another radio or TV.  (Yeah, I 
know I work in the TV biz; TV is fine for what it is, but the Web has 
potential that TV, due to limitations in technology and the political 
structure, will never have.)  This message has been forwarded to Netscape

>Is this nuicance going to be a part of the proposed HTML v 3.0 or is it a

The HTML DTD, whether 3.0 or some other version, should not define the
allowed values of the HTTP-EQUIV attribute on META, because this is
something the HTTP RFC should do.  So the problem you experienced
should be solved elsewhere---obviously, in Netscape.

This makes the assumption that browsers could possibly do it all.
An important capability is the open architecture support of helpers
for types of whose characteristics the browser author cannot be aware.

Client = browser+helpers. Helpers can define their own MIME types
and offer new functionality based on them.

Much of the discussion this topic seems to assume that MIME types form
a finite well-defined set. The extensibility is a very important feature.

Is there a more definitive copy of the CGI 1.1 spec than the one at 
hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu? It has more the sense of a tutorial than a rigorous 
specification.  In particular, I quote from
<URL:http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html>:

   In addition to these, the header lines recieved from the client, if
   any, are placed into the environment with the prefix HTTP_ followed by
   the header name. Any - characters in the header name are changed to _
   characters. The server may exclude any headers which it has already
   processed, such as Authorization, Content-type, and Content-length. If
   necessary, the server may choose to exclude any or all of these
   headers if including them would exceed any system environment limits.

   An example of this is the HTTP_ACCEPT variable which was defined in
   CGI/1.0. Another example is the header User-Agent.

There is no indication here that the header name should be turned into 
all capital letters, as seems to have been done in all the examples.  
True, it is a convention that environment variables be represented in all 
caps, but "foo" and "FOO" are distinct and a literal interpretation of 
the spec would indicate that the env variable should be called HTTP_Accept.

In summary, I know what was *meant*, but I'd much prefer something 
unambiguous.  Does such a beast exist?

     But what about a browser that is ultra-configured, and really _CAN_
   display every type and its grandmother with no lossage whatsoever?

Such a browser would have to figure out how to deal with media types
which were just invented by the guy who runs the server, for which
viewers are not generally available --- to say nothing of the fun to
be had in writing the viewer for application/binary.  Whoever figures
out who to do all *that* can surely figure out how to get his browser
to put an explicit "q=1.0" on the "Accept: */*" header, to suppress
the inappropriate default ;-).

More to the point --- maybe I'm thick, but but I really don't see how
a browser which deals "properly" with *any* media type could possibly
exist, since people can invent new ones at will, so I don't feel
obliged to cater to it (especially when every other browser out there
would be served better by something else).

   Servers
   should make assumptions like this, no matter if they are justified at the
   moment.  Browser authors should get off their !#%!#@ and do it right.

Agreed --- if we can agree that "doing it right" means specifiying
explicit quality values on Accept: headers.

However, so long as the browsers *don't* provide quality values, the
servers have to make assumptions, whether justified or not, and the
only choice we have in the matter is trying to find the set of
assumptions which will cause the least trouble.  My personal view is
that defaulting quality on everything, including */*, to the same
value, isn't the right choice.

I'd prefer to use the term "hack" myself, though Netscape likes to call 
them "cool tricks".

No.  You don't have to use a Netscape server for this - using the META 
tag is all that's needed.  For non-HTML items, many servers allow you to 
add arbitrary HTTP headers to particular objects (WN, Apache, CERN?) and 
you could always use a CGI script to dish them out with custom headers 
too.

The META tag is HTML 2. Standard stuff. Used for several indexing
applications, as far as I know.

Sounds like they've chosen to interpret "http-equiv=refresh" to mean
that the client should go retrieve some stuff after a little
while. Hmmm... I thought http-equiv was intended for the server to
spit out HTTP headers when this document is served. This might be
different from the spirit of the spec, but it's not inconsistent,
technically.

In any case: the HTML spec is hardly relavent. This is an HTTP-related
innovation.

So don't visit providers that use this feature.

Netscape has enabled a certain class of applications, but ultimately,
you still choose whether to participate in them or not.

As an information provider, you choose whether you want to rely on such
experimental features or not too.

Upon whom does the responsibility lie for avoiding ".." in request 
pathnames? Would a server that rejects any URL request with ".." in it be 
non-compliant? It's my (limited) understanding that the client is 
supposed to take care of this, i.e. if I have a page like so:

/foo/bar.html:

<A HREF="../baz.html">Baz</A>

The client should issue that request as /baz.html rarther than 
/foo/../baz.html.  Is this codified anywhere? I don't like the server 
overhead of doing .. translations, I'd rather reject it out of hand, if I 
can.

I'm happy see the list's reaction to the described fuctionality which
leaves too much control to the content creator. 

In the style sheet discussions at the WWW conference in Darmstadt we
were faced with a similar issue. Several people argued that the
content provider should have the last word when deciding how to
present a document. lee@sq.com writes:

Just as "legal liability reasons" are being used to take the control
away from the reader in issues of style, they can also be used to defend
the unwanted client pull mechanism. I'm not too scared about reading
or hearing legal statements, but the fuctionality will be too tempting
for advertisers.

Let's put the legal disclaimers in the HTML3 banner area
(http://www.hpl.hp.co.uk/people/dsr/html/banners.html) and make sure
the reader has control of the rest.

I didn't hear anything about a more rigorous CGI specification than the 
one at hoohoo, so I assume there is none.  NCSA httpd 1.4b4-2 has added 
support for more environment variables: DOCUMENT_ROOT, ERROR_STATUS, 
ERROR_URL, ERROR_REQUEST.  Perhaps even more since then.  Unfortunately, 
none of these appear in the spec.  This sort of thing introduces gratuitous 
incompatabilities -- CGI scripts really shouldn't have to depend on the 
server they are running on, just the CGI version that's implemented.

If the docs at hoohoo are indeed the definitive CGI spec, would the NCSA 
people please start a CGI 1.2 or something before adding more variables? 
HTML and HTTP are splintering enough without CGI joining them.

:)  Too late.  NCSA can add all the variables they like, as far as I'm
concerned, as long as they're passed to the script with the HTTP_ prefix.

Is there any interest for a new look at the CGI spec?  I don't just mean at
NCSA....

A few issues to kick around:

* I like NCSA's DOCUMENT_ROOT idea (which Paul mentions).  A number of
people have bitched about not being able to reliably determine the document
root or server root across a variety of servers without asking for help
from the humans.

* Is there any consensus about what should happen to POSTed data if the
client receives a redirect?  I remember reading somewhere that POSTs get
turned into GETs if redirected; and a couple of browsers mangle POSTs into
PATH_INFO (!?!) if passed through a proxy, as I recall.  Why, I ask you,
why?  Shouldn't POSTs stay POSTs?

* A couple of people have suggested to me hashing out the horrible ACCEPT
issue in a new CGI spec.  I'm not fond of that idea; I think that's an
HTTP-wg problem.  However, maybe something could be done to improve the
amount of information scripts receive from the client, apart from MIME-type
content negotiation.  If a server and a client are negotiating directly,
the HTTP spec would govern; if a gateway stands between the two, content
negotiation can also include the following.... etc.

I'm just kicking around some poorly-thought-out ideas in hopes an argument
will start, which might then produce action.

Apropos of nothing in particular...

It would be nice if WWW browsers gave you the option of including the 
URLs of hyperlinks in the saved versions of HTML documents (perhaps 
some do already?).  For instance, an easy way of doing this would be 
for

  <A HREF="http://www.acme.com/">Acme Widgets, Inc</A>

to become

  Acme Widgets, Inc <URL:http://www.acme.com/>

in a saved (say) text or PostScript version of the document.  There 
are probably quite a few more, and fancier, ways of doing this - like 
footnotes, or an automagically generated list of references at the 
end of the document ?

Just a thought :-)

Cheerio,

Martin

Just to stretch the envelope a little further before the balloon bursts ...

Here's a simple workflow shopping basket scenario that might use a combination 
of cookies and hidden fields to accomplish a single complex ordering transaction.

Company A and B sign up for a collaborative project. Each compnay
will need to purchase some software and hardware from 2 or 3 vendors 
to get the project started. Let's assume that they share a secure 
means of transferring email and that they both have web enabled
mail applications on their desktops.

The project manager A.mgr1 constructs a document to cover the first
proposed purchases. The first additions to the document are for
the company B manager (B.mgr1) and company A's engineer (A.eng1).
As the document is wrapped up A.mgr1 clicks on the link which forwards
the contents of the document to A.engr1 like a routine slip.

Several links are added to the page for various vendors products
(C.prod1  D.prod2). Some products were linked in with special 
deals (C.prod2.reserved.1.2345 at C.prod2.promotion.price
valid til C.prod2.promotion.end_date).

When the engineer finished with the proposal, it was dutifully 
forwarded to B.mgr1 who repeats the process with B.engr1. Some
of the items were simply copied so that both companies would
be using the exact same products (except the prices were slightly 
different due to the timing of the orders and the local 
supplier ordering policies (e.g. $, , ).

After the final approval process, A.mgr1 and B.mgr1 make the final edits 
to the documents and each issue the purchase order for their 
relevant products.

This scenario would require some amount of state to be transported 
along with the document. Information identifying the various companies,
departments and employees would need to be maintained in a secure 
way. Some of the state would be stored at the vendor servers to keep track 
of reserved products or special pricing. Some state would be kept on
a clients workstation to keep track of document routing and intermediate
results of the larger transaction in progress.

. is interpreted by the CLIENT in relative URLs and by the SERVER in
absolute URLs. That is, if you say

	<A HREF="../baz.html">Baz</A> 

in a document whose base is "http://myserver/foo/bar.html", this is a

	<A HREF="http://myserver/../baz.html">Baz</A>

Hi Rick,

HotJava will definitely support the LANG attribute. This attribute
is really useful for our users in Europe that want to provide
the same document in multiple languages.

I'm not sure how to interpret the CLASS attribute. Maybe if someone
could provide us with a set of well understood values.

That is actually very easy.

Every technology has advantages and disadvantages. If you don't like the
way a provider is using it, vote with your mouse.

=46or an alternative use, consider the following.

o User submits form
o Window displays confirmation
o 10 seconds later, the screen refreshes and the user is back where they
started before they went to the form.

More specifically though, I suspect that the feature was implemented to
address the needs of things like stock tickers and the like, which need to
continually refresh to show you what has changed.

I think it is important to step back and determine what exactly the needs
of the content provider are.  The original session-id proposal was put
forth primarily as a means of tracking a single user over a single session.
The Netscape proposal, on the other hand, clearly has more ambitious
goals. Shopping baskets (a metaphor I really despise) may be one of them,
but there are many other things that the proposal does.

We've used the embed-an-id-in-the-url hack on several sites before. We did
it on http://www.firstnight.org/firstnight/ so that we could keep track of
a user intinerary and let people come back to the site later on with all of
their preferences still set. That's roughtly akin to the shopping basket
model. On the other hand, we're doing it on http://www.wcrb.com/wcrb/ and
http://www.mighty.com/mighty/ so that we can provide a user-registration
mechanism that doesn't require remembering a user-name/password
combination. It's a hack and I don't like it, and I play a number of games
to try and make sure that the same ID isn't getting used from multiple
users (it's not a big concern from a security standpoint - if it was we'd
require passwords, but it's a concern nonetheless). I also have to handle
lost IDs of course - it makes life interesting.

I do believe the session-id needs to be server generated - that way we can
use an ID that makes sense to our user-tracking system. The Netscape
proposal for an optional expiration date is also very nice, since it allows
trial periods and the like, something that is very common on the Web.  Path
specific ids are also a requirement, many providers host multiple web sites
that will have different id name spaces. It also needs to be possible to
defeat cacheing - and in that respect I see the cookie proposal as very
much akin to the standard name/password mechanism.

What I really want to avoid is the HotWired/NewsPage problem of "what was
my username and password on *this* site". That's just not acceptable,
particularly for sites which you may not use regularly. You could partially
solve this by having the browser cache name/password pairs over multiple
runs, but I think what I really want is to put the control over identifying
the user totally in the hands of the content provider. And that means the
ability to start a user session without requiring explicit user
interaction.

It does seem to me that the magic-cookie design is very closely tied to
existing password systems, and in that respect I think it's worth
considering whether the two mechanisms might be tied together more tightly
(a user password system with expirations makes perfect sense, for
instance). I haven't delved into that side of the protocol enough to say
any more.

Shopping carts embedded in ids is a cute hack, but it's a red herring. The
real goal in my mind is to find a way to identify a user without requiring
them to carry a separate ID for every store they walk into.

  The 'class' attribute is only useful in stylesheets or when converting to
another DTD, from my understanding.  Arena and emacs-w3 use the class
attribute to be able to specify style information across tags, like:

doc.important: font.family=courier
doc.important: font.size += 5
doc.important: color.text=blue

  Then you can use: <h1 class=important>, <a class=important>, etc.

  People have been doing this for a long time.

They aren't.  The HTTP_ prefix is for client supplied header lines such 
as Referer and User-Agent.  The new, undocumented variables are server 
internals like DOCUMENT_ROOT.

Yes.  For example, what purpose does PATH_TRANSLATED serve? It appears 
to be a catentation of the document root and the PATH_INFO, which is 
superfluous if both those are available.  If this is correct, it should 
be deprecated in a coming CGI version.

I'm all for it too, as long as it's consistently documented somewhere.

Would someone from NCSA please update us as to the state of the CGI spec? 
Who is in charge of revisions? Has anything changed since Rob McCool left 
NCSA? At the very least I would like to see the current ambiguities 
resolved and the new variables documented.

Right, but remember the adage "when you're a hammer, everything looks 
like a nail".  Certainly many applications could be enabled by a 
session-ID that the server could control and manipulate reliably - but 
that doesn't mean that it's the right way to do it.

I've spent many hours look at this from all angles and all possible 
protocol abuses, and can't find a system that satisfies the requirement 
of unique, cross-session identification with any modicum of security that 
doesn't require one to remember a name and password.  Putting the name 
and password in the URL or having people save to their hotlist a URL with 
a session-ID are still hacks.

Hmm - this thesis needs to be explored more deeply.  You suggest a 
user-tracking system that is external to the actual web traffic - could 
you provide some examples?

A server that wanted to have a "trial test period" could also implement a 
fast lookup on hostname+client-generated-session-ID, and see if the time 
stamp associated with that lookup exists and if it is still within the 
time frame allowed.  This goes against the argument against maintaining 
large server-side state as I'll note below, but it means the server 
doesn't have to generate expire times on session ID's (besides, this is a 
lot more secure - someone could very easily write a web browser which 
ignored the "expire" argument and then have indefinite access to a 
section with restricted access)

True that machines may host multiple sites, but why (if the server isn't 
generating session ID's) would those sites not want the same session-ID?  
au contrare, they might like to compare session ID's to see how much they 
help each other's traffic :)

Er, I hope that's a typo.  Any proposal made from here on out needs to be 
able to support caching to some extent - publishing on the web is going 
to become very difficult for anyone but large providers without it.  
In fact, I'd support language in the spec that said "it is strongly 
recommended that servers not generate content that depends on a 
particular session-ID value" - what would be ideal is if proxy caches 
did forward GET If-modified-since requests, *with* the session-ID's, so 
servers who want it can still get good data without having to dish out 
the whole file for every request.  HTTP-NG sounds like it'll have a way 
to forward on Session-ID's, too, even if the proxy never talked to the 
original server when the request was made for a cached object.

As the person who *built* that for hotwired, I couldn't agree more!  What 
I really wanted was a mechaism by which browsers told me what they've 
already seen, and I could generate a page based on comparing that info 
with a list of "whats-new objects" I had, short blurbs of info with 
timestamps and URL's attached.  In fact I posted a proposal a few months 
ago for a State: header which accomplished pretty much what people now 
want to use Session-ID for (although State is a much better term for 
it when used by applications like what's new and shopping carts).  
However, after talking with a few people and watching the conversation 
about shopping carts, I realized what I really wanted was a general way 
to distribute those "what's-new objects" in a way that the client could 
assemble them locally.  The result was the realization that the what's 
new" functionality was something highly generalizable for all URL's out 
there, so an extension of the browser hotlist function to every now and 
then (as set by the user) check up on the last-modified times of various 
URL's and present the list of changed objects as a mail-reader-like 
application would be the most scalable way to go.  It meant HotWired 
would lose the control over formatting they had, admittedly; but once 
Java's around HW could distribute its own version of that "What's New" 
application with their logo in the background of the main window or 
something :)

The point is - there is a much better solution to "what's new" than what 
HotWired is doing coming down the pipe, and instead of incremental 
solutions like basing it on a second-class data object like "Session-ID", 
a bigger leap would really provide bigger results.

Ugh - *so* many problems there.  Security (other people using your 
browser), logistics (what happens if you use someone else's browser?) and 
it does nothing to elimanate the account creation and server-side-state
problem.  I think when my bosses talked about wanting to make the process 
"invisible" they didn't quite realize this....

Agreed... which is why I don't think they should carry a session-ID for 
every store they visit either.  :)

Um, not really.  User directories don't map onto document root.  And 
CERN allows mapping of wildly differing file system paths onto virtual URL 
paths (there's no concept of a single DocumentRoot in CERN's httpd as 
there is in NCSA).  Without PATH_TRANSLATED, it becomes impossible to figure 
out where the actual file system location of the file in PATH_INFO is
(which sounds an awful lot like the problem that DOCUMENT_ROOT is supposed 
to be solving?)

Just as a side note I wish there was a better way of passing file 
names back to the server than in the path info.  It looks really wierd 
in the URL and it only allows you to pass back a single name.  I'd rather
there was a generic method of translating virtual paths to actual 
path names that I could use in my scripts.  If this existed, there woulnd't
be a need for a DOCUMENT_ROOT environment variable at all -- just translate
"/" and you're done.

But I do agree that if NCSA is making unilateral changes to CGI that someone
needs to revisit the spec and update the docs.  Remember, the "C" stands for 
"Common."

The problem I have with these two (I discussed it with
PATH_TRANSLATED, which I wound up punting on) is that they assume that
"document root" can be interpreted in some way that makes sense. Given
that most servers allow arbitrary URLs to be aliased to arbitrary
directory trees, the concept of "document root" doesn't seem to make
sense.

Which is why AWS did away with it. AWS doesn't have a "document root"
per se; it just has URL->directory mappings, one or more of which can
handle URL's starting with "/". A given URL can map to different paths
depending on the existence or non-existence of other files, the IP
address the request came from, and other things I haven't thought of
yet.

If someone is going to take another look at the CGI, I think that
tagging features as "optional dependent on server architechture" might
be worth doing. This lets CGI authors know which things they can
depend on being there, and allows us to create names for data items
that might not be present in all - or even many - servers, but that
some servers want to make available.

  Nope, no assumption about a defined set on my part.  But if someone has
their joe studly machine and browser configured with every helper app known
to man, plus a generic viewer for all */x-yyyyy stuff that asks what to do,
then they can view everything.

  Trying to be psychic and say: 'Ahhh, they said A, but they really must

  Yup, that is my definition of 'right'.  I just need to find a good gui

  I don't think the default should be 0.5... the CERN daemon gives theirs
something like 0.000005 or thereabouts.

Ignoring a double form submission caused by a timeout error is only a
small part of the problem. 

A more important issue is resolving double form submissions that are a
direct result of browsing commands by the user.  If a server receives
a `pizza order' form for a second time, this could mean

0) that some network timeout error occurred

1) that the user wants to order two pizza's

2) that the user wants to change his original order

3) that a browsing command caused the old form to be resubmitted
   without the user being aware of this

Currently, a service author has almost no means to resolve this
ambiguity.


If 2) above sounds implausible, consider the following scenario:

- User fills in a pizza order form and presses `submit' 

- Two seconds later, the user decides he'd rather not have onions on
  the pizza, so he quickly presses `stop' on the browser, deselects
  the onions in the form, and presses `submit' again.

- After 3 seconds, the browser screen shows `you now have ordered
  a pizza ....no onions....'

- After a while, two pizza's are delivered to an astonished user.


There are several ways in which 3), an unintentional resubmission, can
happen.  For example,

a) After ordering a pizza, the user wants to save the confirmation
message to disk for later reference.  The user enables `save to local
disk' on the client, and presses the reload button.  On most clients,
this will cause the form to be submitted for a second time, which will
cause a second pizza to be ordered.

b) Ten minutes after ordering a pizza, the user calls up the client
history list and selects the pizza confirmation message.  In the mean
time, the client cache has dropped the confirmation message contents.
Some clients (Lynx, Netscape, ...), it will now resubmit the form in
order to get the confirmation message contents from the server.  This
makes perfect sense in a stateless protocol, but also causes a second
pizza to be ordered.

It is relatively easy to implement a `reload guard' in the server to
handle these two cases.  However, this `reload' guard will make the
`order pizza' button on the form into a `reload old confirmation
message, do not order a second pizza' button once pressed.

With very careful server programming, and very careful phrasing of
forms and form response messages, some ambiguous situations can be
avoided, but not all of them.  Also, I've found that new clients
often add new ways in which things can go wrong.

                             - _ -

In my opinion, forms intended to change the state in the
user/service dialog should have the following functionality:

1) pressing the `submit' button on such a form will
   a) cause the state to be changed, or
   b) generate an error message about the form being filled in
      incorrectly, or
   c) generate an additional form asking for more information (you have
      already ordered a pizza. Do you want to....), or
   d) generate a `service could not be reached' client error message, or
   e) generate a `your form was sent, but something went wrong, it
      may or may not have been processed' client error message

2) any other browsing operation should never change the state.  In
   particular, reloading the form result may not change the state.

Ideally, a service should always allow the user to query the current
state (did I just order a pizza or not?) by following some link.  This
is especially important if a 1e) error occurs.  If money is involved,
a form submission protocol making 1e) very unlikely would be nice.

To allow service authors to implement the above functionality, some
extensions to the WWW protocols need to be made.

                             - _ -

Current Web technology cannot be used to build a 100% reliable and
intuitive statefull application.

I have not covered all statefullness problems above.  A large
additional class of problems involves WWW pages whose contents change
as a result of user interaction.  With current clients, it is hard to
bypass the old copies of the pages still present in the client cache.
Newer drafts of the HTTP specification say that client caches can be
disabled by using an Expires: <some date in the past> field, but
clients do not implement this functionality yet.

My Futplex system is a WWW service that contains a large number of
workarounds for current statefullness problems, see

  http://gewis.win.tue.nl/applications/futplex

for pointers to the CGI sources.

                             - _ -

In my opinion, several extensions to the current WWW protocols and
software are needed before reliable and intuitive statefull Web
services can be made.

1) A `submit-pressed' flag is needed

 If a client submits a form to a server, the request should contain a
 flag indicating whether or not the submission was caused by the user
 pressing the `submit' button of the form.


2) Some `style rules' for statefull services are needed

 If statefull services are to become reliable and intuitive, some
 basic rules for client and service design are needed.  For example

  a) services should change state only if a `submit' button was pressed
     by the user

  b) caching mechanisms may never interfere with the submission of a
     state-affecting form

  c) clients are required to show an error message if a
     state-affecting form submission operation is interrupted halfway.

 Note that some of these style rules need to be backed up by HTTP
 protocol extensions. Rule a) needs the `submit-pressed' flag.  A
 mechanism for telling whether a form is state-affecting would be nice
 for rules b) and c).

 These style rules ensure that an interactive service will not
 behave in a grossly counter-intuitive way, where `intuitive' is what
 users have come to expect using other services.

 The style rules should not be too restrictive, they should be
 concerned with `low level' user interface issues only.  For example,
 I feel that

  x) statefull services are required to provide a way of querying
     the state

 would be too restrictive.


3) Some form of session-ID or cookie mechanism is needed. 

 A statefull service running on a server (or group of servers) needs a
 mechanism to distinguish between different clients running on a
 remote host.  This would allow session state to be kept at the server
 end.

 For many applications, the ID or cookie must have reasonable
 security; it must be hard or impossible to pose as a particular
 client.


4) Clients caches need to look at the HTTP Expires: field.

 This way, service authors can force clients to fetch a fresh copy of
 a (state-reporting) page, in stead of using the copy in the client
 cache.


All of the above things require only small extensions to existing
protocols and client software.  If anyone is working on formal drafts
for protocol extensions in this direction, please let me know.

This is a very good point, that some of the "identifiers" (session, cookie,
whatever) should have a similar life cycle as security credentials (where
passwds are a valid instance of server side authentication).

It seems to me that a "user centric" view of the web would call for
client side generation of the credentials, that could be reused
at many different storefront businesses.i.e. shopping at a mall
rather than a department store for one stop shopping.

The answer is, again, style sheets: using the notation of my own

this as, for example:

  *A.insertafter: &lt;!HREF&gt;

maining that the formatter inserts text at the end of every A element,
consisting of "<", followed by the value of the element's HREF
attribute, followed by ">".

The current list of proposed style properties is not
complete. Properties applicable to output to anything other than the
screen are missing. One such property is probably one to put text into
a footnote at the bottom of a printed page.

Good thought.

I have attempted to write such a specification. So for, I have defined the
base spec, without any operating-system specifics. For example,
PATH_TRANSLATEED is an optional feature.

The URL is <URL:http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/%7Edrtr/cgi.html>

Hi folks,

If I write according to specifications, and use <P ALIGN=CENTER>
instead of <CENTER>, I get things centered, but also get a
blank line, like here:

<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=5 WIDTH=80%>
<I><P ALIGN=CENTER>2 de maio</I>

How can I avoid this line? I would prefer to have the HR line and
the text closer. Also, how could I define a blank line for browsers
other than Netscape, which seems one of the few to accept <P> as
blank lines, like here:

<P>
<P>

Are there any browsers which handle "tabs" yet ?
I'd like to experiment. I just tried it with Arena - no luck.

I haven't found one yet.  I've tried Arena, Netscape (Win and X), 
Mosaic (Win and X),and WinWeb. No go on these either.

I'm using getstats for my monthly statistics in Data Library. For using 
this program I have to specify the log file which for WWW is httpd-log. 
This file used to include all the accesses starting with the earliest 
date and ending at the most recent one - all the information in one file. 
Some time ago it started to break the information and automatically 
create a separate httpd-log file for each week or even worse for one day.
Is there something I can do to prevent that and what is the reason of 
suddenly creating these files. Thank you for your help!

Does there exist a way to support multiple submit buttons within a single form

different logic path based on which button is selected... eg. help button. 
Thanks in advance for your help...

In one note  about CGI from Vidar Madsen a mension that a CGI may 
overwrite files that the "webmaster" account owns. This may include 
configuration files. 

There is a simple solution. Have the httpd run under a second 
userid/groupid. 

Permission could be given to read the configuration 
file, but since the daemon executes under another account
it would not have permission by default to destroy the files.

In this situation one must be careful to give appropriate 
permission to directories and files for public read and execute
permission only as needed. One must exercize caution in giving write 
privilages.

Yes, definitely.  Though the limits of the CGI interface may dictate that 
there's only so far we can go with this, at which point a real runtime 
API might be a good thing to look at (like NetScape's).  Perhaps someone 
should start www-servers?

I added this many moons ago to my hacked version of httpd, and it found 
its way to the Apache team which is where I presume NCSA picked it up 
from.  Basically I use it because a lot of my site creation has to be 
self-contained, where CGI scripts and libraries and data has to sit 
within one subdirectory.  It's also just good programming to abstract 
away as much as you can, so cases where I had scripts that had to 
assemble a composite page from a bunch of sub objects which were 
themselves accessible individually through the web server had to know 
where to open() files.  

Anyways, if it makes its way into a spec I would be happy to condition it 
on "this is only appropriate for those web servers that employ the 
concept of a document root".  For those web sites that change the file 
system they point to based on IP number or path mapping, the concept of 
the "document root" still holds.

Hmm... I think the problem is that the HTTP method is not expressible in 
a URI, so I don't think the browser has any choice but to do a GET on a 
redirect.  I don't think this is a CGI issue.

Negotiation, horrible?  :) Nah, what's needed is a common function that 
the CGI script can call that takes as input the Accept: string and a list 
of possible data types the script can return, and returns the most 
appropriate data type (text/html vs. text/html3 for example).  The server 
can't do this ahead of time because only the CGI script knows what data 
formats it can return.  Hmm - it would seem to me that the server should 
tell the CGI script what its "qs" values are, though, unless it wants to 
handle the q*qs operations on the Accept: string before it gets passed 
to the CGI script.  Comments?

Also for the CGI 1.2 stew: NCSA and Apache diverged unfortunately in the 
issue of CGI variables with internal redirects.  In both, you can point 
to another URI to be accessed when an error occurs - like having an 
access which results in a 404 get pointed to /404.html or even /404.cgi, 
which could potentially return some cool info.  404.cgi needs to know 
some information about the original access to make some intelligent 
decisions, but it would be incorrect to just make its CGI environment 
exactly that of the error-causing access.  Thus, Apache introduces a few 
more variables using REDIRECT_ as the base, and NCSA used ERROR_ as the 
base.  We chose the former as they aren't necessarily the result of an 
error (like 401 responses for example), and when HTTP/1.1 allows us to 
send a Base: header then scripts like imagemap can be made one access 
instead of two using internal redirection.

Agreed - I was saying that any proposal for web mechanisms these days 
must not make caching impossible, so we're not conflicting here.  The 
problem with the cookie proposal was that it made proxy-defeating the 
*norm*. 

> It's necessary when

Yes - if someone is connecting to a financial company and wants to see how
their portfolio is doing, sure, that can't be cached (it'll most likely be
encrypted anyways).  But the question is if you should base that a
Session-ID or a real user-password system.  I would vote for the latter.
The real solution is one where the financial company sends the investor a
portfolio-app (Java or otherwise) which queries dowjones.com via HTTP (or
better yet, dowjones.com broadcasts stats via multicasting, which the
portfolio app listens to giving you info real time on your portfolio).  

But the debate here is whether using Session-ID is appropriate for 
tailoring information.... and I still say no, because I think for every 
application where someone can show it's useful, there's a much better 
long term solution.

Yes.  Distributed.  Absolutely.  Custom-creating content for every access
is the opposite.  Distribution works *best* when the objects being flung
around the net are as generic as possible (thus highly cacheable), and the
customization happens as close to the client as possible.  Make the 
clients just as smart, if not smarter than, the servers.  

I will admit this doesn't solve content-provider's problems and needs 
right now.  Those of us who want to provide custom content really do 
have to rely on password-based mechanisms or URL hacks for now - but I 
don't think the tool-builders need to waste their time with short term 
solutions which will just make the content-providers suffer longer (if a 
little less).

So *don't* use Session-ID's for sensitive information!  There are lots of
other security work going on, the last thing we need is a parallel
mechanism. 

Besides, Session-Id *can't* provide authentication information by itself, 
since it's the server issuing them.  The server could issue them when a 
page is accessed via usual HTTP user authentication of course, but the 
thought was to eliminate that.

Again, *authentication* is entirely separate and should be out of the 
scope of Session-ID.  Eventually, yes, public-key crypto will allow 
people to authenticate themselves without requiring huge user databases 
on the server end, but that's not quite the same issue here.  Server X 
should be able to discern my path through their service without getting 
any personal info about me.

  I believe you can do this with 

<tab align=right> in the current draft of HTML 3.0.

Greeting,

   I was trying to get one of my local applications launched and was
working on "Helper application" with windows. 

   One question is can I launch application without extension, i.e.
not specifying the file extention?  It was not successful. 
If someone have such experience, I would appreciate it if you can send
some tips to me.

Are there any browsers which handle "tabs" yet ?

Greetings Fellow Earthlings,

        I am trying to setup a Web site that accesses an Informix
database. I am using the NCSA server and their CGI interface. I have 
written my applications in ESQL/C. Now the tricky part. I can
execute my program at the command line and enter data as HTTPD will
The database is accessed and I can actually see data records 
fly by (amazing my program works). BUT when the HTTPD demon
tries to do this it fails with:

       
        There is problem with your query!
        The following SQL error has occured at open_database_esql!! 
        The Error Code is -457 in database: Database server
        terminated unexpectedly. 
        
        
Ok, so I talked with tech support and we all think it must have 
something to do with the environment that the demon is executing
under. I modified the C code to set the following:

        TBCONFIG
        DBPATH
        INFORMIXDIR
        SQLEXEC

After I set these values I printed them. They look ok, but the
program STILL fails.

Therefore, I am interested in talking to, emailing, faxing, or
whatever to people who have setup web sites that integrate the
HTTPD demon with Informix Online.


Any help that you give would be greatly appreciated.

Larry

You have nearly written to specification, but not quite. You have an hr, so 
following text starts on a new line. A new paragraph is implied by your text. 
You go into italics. Then you start another new paragraph!

Instead, try
<HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=5 WIDTH=80%>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>2 de maio</I></P>

The exact spacing depends on how your browser chooses to render this.

I think that browsers are at liberty to coalesce multiple empty paragraphs.
You probably want to use <BR>

I am new to this mailing list and am not sure if this
has been discussed. But here it goes.
    Is it possible to have 2 different names resolve to 
    the same server but point to two different home pages.
     For example : x.y.z should point to page 1 in my sun and
                   address http://a.b.c should point to page 2
                   in my sun.
If yes, how do I do that. We use DNS and I can setup CNAME aliases
for my sun so that x.y.z and a.b.c both point to my sun platform. 
How do I make httpd to resolve these different names and serve
the proper home page.
If this is not possible if there a workaround.
Thanks a lot in advance.

	That's not how it works. You have to run two different httpd's (with 
different root areas, of course). They would run on diff ports, say one 
on 80 (default) and the other on 2000. URL for the first is

http://xyz.com/

and that for the second

http://xyz.com:2000/
or http://abcd.com:2000/

assuming that abcd.com is the DNS equivalent of xyz.com, and is a more 
logical name for the second server.

The port number has to be there. Am I missing a point?

The URL very well might have been http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html,
which is a listing of most (but not all) CGI environment variables.
The variable HTTP_USER_AGENT is the one you're after.

To answer Elisabeth's question about identifying the browser --

A CGI program has access to a great number of environment variables which
give you all sorts of information about what's happening at run time.  This
is not available to plain HTML; you need to have a CGI program.

But if you do, here are some of the benefits:

' [CGI]                <== The standard CGI variables
' CGI Version=         The version of CGI spoken by the server
' Request Protocol=    The server's info protocol (e.g. HTTP/1.0)
' Request Method=      The method specified in the request (e.g., "GET")
' Executable Path=     Physical pathname of the back-end (this program)
' Logical Path=        Extra path info in logical space
' Physical Path=       Extra path info in local physical space
' Query String=        String following the "?" in the request URL
' Content Type=        MIME content type of info supplied with request
' Content Length=      Length, bytes, of info supplied with request
' Server Software=     Version/revision of the info (HTTP) server
' Server Name=         Server's network hostname (or alias from config)
' Server Port=         Server's network port number
' Server Admin=        E-Mail address of server's admin. (config)
' Referer=             URL of referring document (HTTP/1.0 draft 12/94)
' From=                E-Mail of client user  (HTTP/1.0 draft 12/94)
' Remote Host=         Remote client's network hostname
' Remote Address=      Remote client's network address
' Authenticated Username=Username if present in request
' Authenticated Password=Password if present in request
' Authentication Method=Method used for authentication (e.g., "Basic")
' Authentication Realm=Name of realm for users/groups

If you're developing on a Windows NT platform, you might check out
http://website.ora.com for more information.  O'Reilly's server makes it
very easy to get at these facts.

Hope this helps,

You can't do it with DNS.  Here's one approach:

   From: Rupesh Kapoor <rupesh@altair.shaktiweb.com>

   That's not how it works. You have to run two different httpd's (with 
   different root areas, of course). They would run on diff ports, say one 
   on 80 (default) and the other on 2000. URL for the first is

   http://xyz.com/

   and that for the second

   http://xyz.com:2000/
   or http://abcd.com:2000/

Alternatively, if your computer has multiple network interfaces (or
can be configured to pretend that it does), you can assign one IP
address to abcd.com, assign another to xyz.com, and run a server which
behaves differently depending on which IP address is used to contact
it.  The important thing is that the IP addresses must be distinct,
since an HTTP client doesn't try to tell the server what it thinks the
server's name is.

The server you use has to be aware of this arrangement as well, of
course.  Patches are available for the NCSA server (and probably for
CERN as well); Apache, an NCSA derivative, comes with this code
integrated in to the main body (and we've even gotten around to
documenting it).  See

  http://www.hyperreal.com/apache/docs/virtual-host.html

for details on how this works...

There's been a lot of grumbling about the ease of mail/news forgery 
via WWW browsers, but it would be trivial to add a simple user 
authentication mechanism based on say the POP (RFC 1725) or IMAP (RFC 
1730) protocols

Using the simple (cleartext) POP3 authentication, the entire authentication dialogue need only consist of the following ...

  +OK POP server starting
  user martin
  +OK Password required for martin.
  pass secret
  +OK martin has 3 message(s) (34153 octets).
  quit
  +OK Pop server says bye!

Of course there are fancier scenarios using Kerberos, S/Key ... :-)

Just a thought!

After trying to get the Two Servers solution to work 
(ie http://www.thesphere/.com/~edlp/twoservers/) I am wondering if there are
alternatives to this solution.

I am also wondering if any one has set up a multiple domain web server on
Unixware 2.0.  

The Two Servers solution was going fine until I tried to get a seperate IP 
Interface running.  The nic was not liking the an additional IP address and
PPP did not like to have a default route. 

So, If someone may be able to help me, blessed be...

TIA

Having the client setting the quality factors to either '0' or '1' depending on
what it can find, and then have the users adjusting according to their personal
preferences is in my opinion a perfectly good way of doing it. In the gray zone
between '0' and '1' the quality factor acts pretty much like the accept language
header: The user has to take part in assigning values.

The HTTP specification is not very clear when it comes to content-negotiation.
There are several reasons for this: First of all because most URLs maps directly
to a specific file type which leaves little room for content-negotiation (because
the document only exists in one format); Second because nobody has been able to
come up with a good set of parameters for network performance that can be used
to select the desired media type (BTW: this is not only a problem for HTTP). 
Obviously, size is a reasonable parameter, but I don't think the only one required
in a flexible algorithm.

So maybe we simply have no choice but to let the quality factor be a mapping of user
preferences!

I know that there is a way to check what browser is accessing your server.
I remember seeing this on a URL somewhere.  Does anyone know how this works
or where I could get more information?  I would like to be able to send a
page that is optimized for the accessing browser. Anyone have a good idea
where I should start?

Hey, this gets on my nerves. When will someone do something about it? It's so
easy to add a f...ing "Host: " or "Full-URI: " header that would enable us
to do that without such a hack. Multiple IPs per host _is_ a hack. It can
only be done on a small number of OSes, and it is a real waste of IP
addresses. I _thought_ we were running out of IP address space. Looks like
you guys just want to use it still more quickly!

I have to agree that the guy that came up with this was clever, as this
works with the installed base, but such a small modification of the
protocol would be _sooooo_ easy to implement in both clients and servers
that I think that every single client and server existing would be upgraded
in a matter of weeks, and that the installed base would in a few months be
80 to 90% converted.

One would still need a "choose which home page you want" page for the case
when the server does not know who was in fact selected, and that would work
for everybody till he switches to a newer client.

So, why, _why_, *why*, WHY? A single line! It's so easy!

The worst is, it's been discussed a number of times, everytime everyone
agrees and says, OK, that's a good idea, let's do it, and then nobody
moves. What should I do? Send every web browser and server author a
personal mail to ask him to do it?

Hope this one is the good one :-)

Yes, and even worse, you commited the sin of misinformation.


<TITLE>multi-domain hosts (the shocking truth -- long)</TITLE>

<P>I assume what you really want are multiple,
parallel services that appear to be different machines
but are really one machine -- and since I believe
this is of general interest, here is that story.

<P>The most common request for this is from people
that want to setup parallel web servers (e.g.,
http://www.number1.com/ and http://www.number2.com/
on the same machine serving totally independant
information).  This information is aimed mainly at
people using a un*x platform.

<P>First, you <B>must</B> be able to configure multiple
network interfaces on the machine with different IP
addresses.  Some (un*x) machines can do this with
the <I><A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi-man/?ifconfig(8)">ifconfig</A></I>
command using the alias option, for example:<PRE>
        ifconfig XX# alias ##.##.##.##</PRE>

<P>On other machines you can use spare SLIP or PPP
interfaces as placeholders for the new IP address,
but one way or another you <B>must</B> have multiple IP
addresses on that machine or else you simply
<B>cannot</B> do it (you cannot do it simply by messing
with DNS).  There is nothing special
you need to do with DNS either, you just assign the new IP
address to the name you want to use.  The seperation
totally depends on the IP addresses, the names really
have nothing to do with (they are what the user sees
and nothing more -- the machines really don't care much about
them).

<P>Ok, now for some technical bits, (<I>please note
that some details will vary depending on the
implementation of TCP/IP</I>).  When an application
<A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi-man/?bind(2)">binds</A></I>
to a <B>TCP</B> port it must specify (amongst
other things) the <B>port</B> to which it will
bind (e.g., gopher, ftp, http, except it uses the
port number) and the address (which is often specified
as <B>INADDR_ANY</B> which means that it will
accept packets for all local destinations, that is,
IP addresses on this machine).

<P>This specification is done in a <B>struct sockaddr_in</B>
which looks like: <PRE>
        struct sockaddr_in {
                u_char  sin_len;
                u_char  sin_family;
                u_short sin_port;
                struct  in_addr sin_addr;
                char    sin_zero[8];
        }; </PRE>

<P>And the C code to setup the socket goes something like this
(this is just pseudo-code, error checking should be done, etc):<PRE>
        int socket_fd;
        int on = 1;
        struct sockaddr_in sa_in;

        socket_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
        (void) setsockopt(socket_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR,
                (char *)&on, sizeof on);

	/* ... */

        /* fill in data for bind */
	bzero((char *) &sa_in, sizeof sa_in);
        sa_in.sin_family = AF_INET;
        sa_in.sin_port = 80;                    /* shouldn't be hardcoded */
	/* At this point, most applications have something like the following:
         *     sa_in.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
	 * and you need to change it to something like: */
	{
	    /* should use gethostbyname() in real code and get
	     * the argument from the command line  */
	    long int hostaddr1 = inet_addr("1.2.3.4");
	    sa_in.sin_addr.s_addr = hostaddr1;      /* change binding here */
	}
        bind(socket_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&sa_in, sizeof sa_in);
</PRE>
<P>The reason I've given you the technical details
above is that most existing internet applications
do not provide any way to specify the host to use
in the <B>s_addr</B> field, they just hardcode the
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>
and that does what most people want.  So in most
case you will have to go in and modify the code
(in the best possible case you would add an option
that allows you to specify the binding on the command
line or in a configuration file, if not, I think
many people could hardcode in a new binding given the
information above).  If that fails, call your local
system admin (but please don't call me).

<P>One really neat thing you can do with this is,
once you get it all working you can run a "default"
server bound to <B>INADDR_ANY</B> (remember, that is the
default address and will accept packets for any
address not bound to some other server) and have it
return a "sorry, temporarily out of service" message
to the client <B>and</B> email the local webmaster
that something has gone wrong! (<I>help me</I>)

<P>Since I am, among other things, the author of
the <A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/plexus.html">Plexus</A>
HTTP server (it's public domain code so don't worry,
this isn't a plug for money) I now must give a
shameless little plug for my server, which supports
this feature of binding to specific addresses in
the standard distribution.  And all you have to do
(after you get it installed of course) is to use
the <TT>-h</TT> flag to specify which address to
bind to:<PRE>
        plexus -h austin.bsdi.com</PRE>

<P>That's it!  Now you have a server bound to the
IP address for austin.bsdi.com on port 80.
You could then run another "default"
server (as mentioned above) just by running <I>plexus</I>
without the <TT>-h</TT> flag, and it will bind to
<B>INADDR_ANY</B> (tada).


In addition to the above quick hack, you could make the server a little
bit smarter and a single server could service multiple IP addrs
-- I leave this as an exercise for the reader.

If you have further questions please contact your local guru and not me.

What for is to add a bad implementation of another (not strongly 
required) protocol into complex browser.

Now we have a bad mailto implementation (required) and bad newsreader
implementation (not strongly required). Doubtfully some more bad 
implementations are needed.

For the one hand the browsers we see now are getting to grow into
monsters. They take loads of resources (MS-Windows based for example).
IMHO, much better is to have the browser made of modules or with posibility
fork a module, mosts of them can be replaced with (or added) specialised 
and more convenient to the user's choice.

I assume you want the searchable database to be on the server?  Most Web
Site providers we have talked to are happy to let you have forms which mail
you the results. However they are very hesitant about letting people write
arbitrary scripts that run on their machines. Just to complicate things,
even if they do let you write such scripts, they probably run their server
with a user of 'none', which means that any files you have your scripts
create will have to be writable by everyone on the machine - a not so
pleasant situation.

That said, it's not impossible. We have relationships with several
providers that allow us to write scripts - but they don't let all of their
customers do so. And the degree of security ranges from none to having to
pass our scripts through their vetting process.

I don't think you'll see the situation improve much until the server
companies start providing servers that run chroot'd as a specified a user.
Then you can have your own partition on the machine and the provider won't
have as many concerns.

(This topic may be better suited for www-talk, I've cc'd it there.)

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

i agree that this is a nervy thing, and i don't like the way it's currently
done, but unless i am missing something, i don't see how adding ANY information
to a documentt will fix this.

yes, it's a hack, a a benefit of running a real os (where this ability is there
exactly for this reason - hopefully a temporary solution until...)

.. the above can be implemented. doing this by dns is the correct way (analogous
to the correct use of MX records to do similar functional vis-a-vis email).

if this change to dns is being considered, that's good enought for me - year
ago you couldn't get any to even listen to such an idea.

as for the current hack being clever - it ain't; ip alias games has been a useful
unix admin tool for years - saying it's clever is like saying "ain't it clever
to put a bandage on that cut" - it's obvious.

as for the apache hint - unless something has changed, how to do this is not
documented, and the actual routing manipulations will probably be somewhat
unix vendor/setup specific; there's at least two ways this can be done.

Hello WWWorld,

 I have a HTTP protocol question.

I have a simple HTTP client that requests an object from a HTTP server using
the GET method. Now, the client is written such that it mandatorily needs the
server to return the 'Content-length:' header in its response.

The problem I am facing is, this header is returned for most kind of objects
(image/gif, audio/au etc) but not for text/html. Is there any special form
of the GET request that will force the server to return the size of the object
(the 'Content-length:' header) irrespective of its MIME type ?

Thanks for your help!
Srivatsa Srinivasan

If this is the case then it is a server bug! The Content-Length header
should be sent whenever possible in a full response, and it should certainly
not have anything to do with the media type in which the object is rendered.

I can imagine that the problems can be due to server side includes in the
documents or dynamic documents generated by scripts.

The most recent HTTP 1.0 draft I could find states:

   Although it is not required, applications are strongly encouraged to
   use this field to indicate the size of the Entity-Body to be
   transferred, regardless of the media type of the entity.

The first five words here are the important ones... the server doesn't 
have to include Content-Length, and sometimes it doesn't. It's certainly 
nice, but you can't assume that this header will exist when writing an 
HTTP client. Because it won't always. But it is odd that your server 
returns the header for images, but not text... sounds like a bug.

The refresh header is planned for HTTP/1.1 - actually, as far as I remember,
it was in one of the drafts but was taken out again?

Gee, sounds like Sun marketing is on the right track.  Modular browsers,
what a concept! So we all wait for WebBrowser to be ported to Windows?
Hot Java here we come...

Personally, I find the feature creep is bring us ever so close to SGML
that we should have jumped on the DoD bandwagon years ago. Better
authentication will only work if the encryption methods are available
internationally and legislation like the new California key-server laws
don't drive the price of registration to a magnetude greater than the
application cost ($30).  That they require more overhead is only a side
effect.

Yeah, how bout an OpenDoc browser Netscape?
Is that a no-brainer or a novel concept?

It is the first try for me to ask a question.
I am studying HTTP now.
after I logined by "telnet 'hostname' 80 ",
I try to PUT, GET, POST methods test.
for example, I did like
"GET http://shiva.hsr.re.kr/~~/file.html HTTP/1.0".
but at that time, I received 404 error message.
I became to know that the server is the NCSA/1.3.
I want to the response from the server that I write.
How can I do at this time?
if you know, reply to me. 
the faster, the better. 

regards, 
  Sunny.

ps::sorry for my clumsy english. ;)

Not a great waste, no.  The _great_ waste of IP addresses is the number of
blocks being allocated, one block per organization.  I work for a small
company which has been allocated almost a hundred times as many addresses
as we use; a fairly common situation and very wasteful.

Compared to that waste, everything else is just surface noise.  We're
about to set up www.troll.no, when we have we'll occupy 257 IP addresses,
one up from 256.  And that's the worst case.  If troll.no had 1024 IP
addresses we'd would use 1025; 0.1% extra.  When even the worst case is
less than 0.25% waste, who cares?

The internet draft draft-gulbrandsen-dns-rr-srvcs-00.txt may, with one
change (an additional "actual port" data field in the RR), be used to
solve this "problem".  But it would require all the clients to change,
every single one.

I'd appreciate comments on the draft; should I put back in "actual port"? 
It was there in the very first version, but went away for lack of
perceived use.

Sure - but if you are going to implement (say) mailto support in your browser, ought you not to at least make a token(!) effort to find out whether the user is who they're claiming to be ?

Plus, the scenario I outlined hardly adds virtually no new code to the browser. Is this more or less worthwhile than <blink> ... </blink> ? :-)

How can I find the file name of a document with the URL:

http://foo.co.uk/

Is there a methode to get the filename, or do I just have to assume 
index.html?

Our server WWW server for Windows NT (Purveyor) routinely took 250,000 hits
in a 24 hour period (measured during finalt testing right before release)
so Unix certainly isn't the only choice.

   From: Srivatsa Srinivasan <srinivas@cs.iastate.edu>

   Hello WWWorld,

    I have a HTTP protocol question.

   I have a simple HTTP client that requests an object from a HTTP
   server using the GET method. Now, the client is written such that
   it mandatorily needs the server to return the 'Content-length:'
   header in its response.

   The problem I am facing is, this header is returned for most kind
   of objects (image/gif, audio/au etc) but not for text/html. Is
   there any special form of the GET request that will force the
   server to return the size of the object (the 'Content-length:'
   header) irrespective of its MIME type ?

As some people have mentioned, the answer is no --- the server doesn't
know the content-length of dynamically generated objects (i.e., those
resulting from processing of server-side includes or invocation of a
CGI script), so it *can't* report content-length for those items.  If
the server is NCSA-type, and the webmaster has declared all *.html
files to be server-side-included, the effect will be as you report ---
no HTML files will have content-length reported.

(In principle, the server could do a prepass over the file to see if
any inclusion directives are present, and report content-length if
there aren't any; in practice, it doesn't).

You can't. Not shouldn't you. And perhaps it is not even a file.

Yes, it has been discussed, and it is a good idea.  The problem is
deployment.  Suppose you're running a server for companies X and Y.
The server gets a request via an old client program, and there's no
Host: or Full-URI:  header.  What should the server do?

Here are some possibilities, all bad:
1) Always return the page for company X [Y].  Obviously this surprises
the customers of company Y [X].
2) Return a page that says "Follow this link to company X and this link
to company Y."  But company X may not like to be mentioned in the same
sentence as company Y.
3) Return an error.

I suppose one approach is to require conformance by browsers by date X.
Servers are not an issue -- a server only cares if it wants to offer a
service that depends on the new headers, and it might plan to do so,
say, at X plus six months.  There's still the issue of how to deal with
old browsers.  (Not everyone can or will get a fresh, shiny new browser
every couple of months.)  A server could deny them access, but that's
not very friendly.

        Dave illustrates the problem(s) pretty well.

        I don't understand why we're so hung up on

                http://X.mythical.host.com/
                http://Y.mythical.host.com/

        Why can't we go directly to  "non home"  or  sub-pages?
Why can't we do things like this:

                http://service.provider.net/home_page_X
                http://service.provider.net/home_page_Y

        Perhaps I've forgotten why,  if the original poster indicated.

        Ramani?   What was the problem with this approach?

This is prefectly OK, as HTTP/1.0 defines its own `canonicalization' of
type `text' and `application' where CR, LF, or any octet sequence defined
by a character set all represent the equivalent of CRLF, though only in the
entity-body!

If you are not going to make heavy use of the web server it may be a good
idea to use Linux on a 386 clone PC. The price for linux is right, about
$20-$50 for a CD. The performance is acceptable, Linux will run quite happly
on an 8M system. 

If you have a reason to want to minimize your support issues then it may be
worth your while to go with a sparc solution since you allready have 2.

Windows NT will work but the cost/performace of NT is about 1/2 of that
of linux. Also the off the shelf software for NT is nowhere as complete as
that available for Linux/Solaris.

I have installed Internet services on the 3 above OS's and am baseing my 
comments on experiance.

Mac I have no idea about

I'll chime in on this one. :-) I've setup and maintained NCSA, Cern, WN,
and Netscape httpd systems running under SunOS, Solaris, Linux (Slackware),
and MacHTTP under the MacOS. By far, the easiest server to get up and
running was the MacOS with MacHTTP (now called WebStar). MacHTTP can do
just about everything the other httpds can do, but it is a piece of cake to
manage (uses forms just like the commercial Netscape daemon) and its a heck
of a lot cheaper than a UNIX box.

The UNIX-variants were/are more involved and really require someone with
good UNIX knowledge to be able to run the systems. It's harder to find (and
costs more to keep) someone with UNIX skills than Mac skills. And frankly,
until you're dishing out well over a million hits a week, it really doesn't
pay for most folks to futz with the UNIX-based systems -- especially if
they don't already have in-house UNIX experience. If there's a feature with
a particular UNIX daemon that the Mac version doesn't have, and you're
willing to pay the premium, go ahead and go UNIX. But if you just want to
get some pages up cheaply, the Mac is hard to beat (and I'm not even going
to bring in arguments about RAICs (redundant arrays of inexpensive
computers) :-).

Caching is a bad idea for something that changes length every time
it's called. (Oh, quote-of-the-day, for example, or just the output
from a request form.) Waiting to cache something that will never be
needed again doesn't optimize anything, and adds unnecessary latency
to the transaction while the server generates all of the data.

I've noticed web sites that give the appearance of rapid response from
search requests by returning immediately the header (complete with
large inline usually-cached-by-the-client images) before actually
completing the search results.

Well, it is unfortunate that more serious thought wan't given to
to the problems involved with this, perhaps.  Canonicalization of textual
line breaks, however, is no longer required under HTTP in general; instead,
all HTTP software is required to be able to recognize various different
common line endings when receiving bodies.  The result is not fantastic
or elegant but it's workable.

(Not that it matters too much with HTML, since aside from in <PRE> all
whitespace is created equal.  But, since HTML and HTTP are orthogonal,
it's still an issue.)

Of course; there are limits on how much buffering one wants to do.
I'll use this moment to revisit my personal pet idea, which is that the
headers and status line and other metadata really should go after the
body of the response, not before it. :-)

I have done a good deal of HTML page development for various different
reasons, and have found this idea to be useful in many cases.  I propose an
addition to HTML 3.0 that would allow small windows to pop up when the mouse
is overtop of some keywords, containing some information.  Example:

<body>
This is a new feature of
<window show="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</window>.
</body>

OR

<body>
This is a new feature of
<a html="HyperText Markup Language" window>HTML</a>.
</body>

Rendered

This is a new feature of HTML

                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are many times when this would be useful to present information.  From
my experience in programming, it does not seem a difficult task to add such
a feature in a browser.  The tag is simple and aids the general puprpose of
HTML.  I would appresiate any feedback and discussion on it's possibilities
or functionality.

That's what the Expires header is good for, isn't it? See
<http://www.nads.de/NADS/Ueberblick/heute> for an example. This URL
gives you an overview of events in Dsseldorf and about for the
very day. It expires at the end of the day (local time in Germany).

(In fact, it is just a 302 Redirect message pointing to the real
document. To make the CERN httpd cache redirections, see my patch
under
<http://www.nads.de/NADS/Public/WWWTechnik/WWWDaemon-patch.01.gz>.)

I think Jeremy Miller's idea of having popup menus is an excellent
one, and wanted to ask this group if an idea I had is worth considering.

One of the things I ran into in creating a teching tool recently was
that I couldn't denote a particular thread.  I wanted to target the
paper for multiple audiences and provide support for less technically-
inclined audiences without compromising the flow of the paper.  It
seemed logical to me to define a named type of link that has a particular
color associated with it.  All the references to definitions could be
in blue, the links to other elements of the discussion in red, and 
purple would jump off my server to an off-site page.  All visited
links could be tan if I felt like it.  There's currently a method in
Netscape 1.1 to define different colors for visited and new links,
as well as redefining the standard text color, but there's no way
to have your own labelled links.  

Am I way behind the times, or is this a legitimate item?

Granted, but I'm not entirely sure of the connection you're trying to make.
For the most part, my dynamically generated objects don't change length or
content and it's ok to cache them.  For the ones that do change every time,
I add an Expires header to the response to let know caching mechanisms now
not to cache it.  Unfortunately, my tests indicate that Netscape doesn't
handle the Expires header properly :(

Not to defend Netscape against anything, but is there a client at
all that handles Expires properly? Not even the CERN proxy does.

You're too late, it has already been proposed:-) It now seems likely
that there will be a footnote tag (<FN>) in HTML 3.0, with a suggested
rendering like what you describe. See
<http://www.hpl.hp.co.uk/people/dsr/html3/CoverPage.html> for the
currently proposed syntax. The exact syntax may still change, but the
basic idea is there.

This is server specific.  Some servers, at least, are set up to 
automatically load other file names when they are not specified in your 
URL (e.g. welcome.html).  What browser are you using? (please reply to me 
directly, and I'll see if I can help)

I believe Netscape intends to use this (or something similar to it) for
simple animations techniques as well.

This feels like a style sheet issue - you have something like

a.class1 = #F00
a.class2 = #0F0

and then

<a href="file1.html" class="class1">This class of link</a>
<a href="file2.html" class="class2">That other class of link</a>

Is this what you want?  Style sheet designers should note the need for 
different colors for visited and not-yet-visited links of course.

Hi,

I'm not sure it's the right place to send that query, but here it goes....


Well, I've been trying to get an answer from moreinfo@netscape.com
without success. Maybe someone here has the answer.

Does Netscape support Navigator's binary license for Linux and
Solaris x86 platforms?

Cheers,

Subject: NCSA Server (1.3) and ScriptAlias problems
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
X-Comment: To sign off, send mail to listproc@mail.w3.org with body DEL WWW-TALK

The issue is how to deal with a ScriptAlias that is serving up multiple
HTML files, e.g.:

        ScriptAlias /bgc/ /xxx/bgc/access/
        ScriptAlias /bgc /xxx/bgc/access/

In particular, the problem is that the script can't tell the difference
between being invoked with or without the trailing slash, and the
difference is quite critical. I suspect that there should be a difference
in PATH_INFO, but there isn't. Is that a bug, or is there another better
way of dealing with this?

1. If you don't have the version with the trailing slash, the (non-trivial
number of) people who hit the site without it will get a file not-found.
This isn't the case when the server is handling access, but it is the case
when you are using a ScriptAlias.

2. If you point them both at the same script, the script can't tell whether
it was invoked with or without the slash (I believe there ought to be a
difference in PATH_INFO, but there isn't).

3. The script can do one of two things when faced with a directory name
with no index.html. It can't do a redirect to the index.html file (which
takes up a fair amount of time, and of course additional server resources),
or it can just server up the file.

4. If it serves up the file, the client will get all the relative links
wrong. It's URL will look like "http://www.xxx.bar/foo", it will assume
that "foo" is a file and make all links relative to the link instead of
"foo/". You can try and fix this with a <base href=3D"correcturl"> in the
index.html file, but that doesn't work for all browsers.

5. My solution therefore, is to have a separate script, bound to the
non-slash version of the name, which does nothing but redirect the user to
the correct URL. Ugly, but there it is.

Comments?

This has the disadvantage of leaving the user to wait until your render is
done. Otherwise for large options you could be presenting the object while
rendering, thus decreasing the overall display time and increasing user
satisfaction.

Well the local ISPs in my area dynamically assign IP numbers,
but nonetheless register their entires series on DNS.  But
probably lots of other ISPs don't.

Mainly, though, I suspect that there's simply a lot of reverse
DNS table entries missing all over the world...

Hi -- we're trying to describe, in a few paragraphs, the development and 
significance of the various HTML specifications. I'd like to get comments 
on these paragraphs to see whether they are, in fact, an accurate summary:

"The first release of HTML, HTML Level 0, is the original HTML 
specification. Although the base-level HTML reference, some of the tags 
present in Level 0 have since become depreciated.

"HTML Level 1 includes the Level 0 tags, with some additional features, 
such as images, primarily introduced by the Mosaic development team.

"With the introduction of it Netscape Navigator Web browser, Netscape 
introduced many tags which were particular to its browser, such as CENTER 
and BLINK. Netscape has since joined the ranks of the 
standards committees and have labeled the tags it introduces not within 
the official HTML specification as "experimental".

"HTML Level 2 contained some revisions to HTML to make it an 
SGML-compliant language, and added support for forms.

"HTML Level 3 includes work to include support for non-Western European 
writing systems, table, figure, and scientific notation support, 
client-side image maps and other interactive applications, and style sheets."

My questions are -- is HTML Level 2 synonymous with HTML 2.0, and so on? 
Or are the conformance levels different from the version numbers, and if 
so, how? And, in general, is the above accurate?

Any comments greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I think a packet oriented approach would help. I know at one time there was
talk of doing inline objects that way and interspersing the packets so that
you could do what Netscape does without opening N-connections to the
server. Obviously it seriously complicates the protocols though.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

I believe Emacs-w3 does, but I'd have to run some more exhaustive tests,
since when I found out Netscape's behavior, I had to resort to other means
besides Expires.  I would note that section 7.1.8 of
draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-00 states:

   Caching clients (including proxies) must not cache this copy of the
   resource beyond the date given, unless its status has been updated by a
   later check of the origin server.

The key word is "must"; caching clients that do not handle the Expires
header are non-compliant HTTP applications (well, granted that the standard
is only a draft, but it's all we've got).

No, I don't believe so, because one of the stated requirements is that we be

I have seen a similar problem under Solaris 2.3; gmtime would include the
hour for daylight saving time.

That problem does not exist under Solaris 2.4.

     I have a problem and if anybody could help I would be most pleased. If 
     this is not the correct list for this kind of help, please forgive my 
     ignorance.
     
     Appended arguments to a URL (GET method) do not appear to be passed to 
     the cgi-test.pl script that ships with the cgi-lib.zip distribution 
     package for WWW/perl/HTML. (httpd & Mosaic for Linux, perl4)
     
     To recreate :
     
     1) Generate some HTML from a gateway script. 2) Include a URL that 
     looks like
     
     <A HREF="HTTP://hostname/cgi-lib/test-cgi.pl?123+myfile.tmpl">click 
     here</A>.
     3) Click on the URL and wait for a return from the cgi-test script. 
     The script returns a blank page - the arguments are being passed but 
     are not being displayed (no prompt for an argument appears). 
     
     It was my impression that this script would be the best way to test 
     that the URLs I am generating in my gateway script are valid. Any 
     arguments I pass to them by appending should be listed in the returned 
     page. This is either not the case or something else is happening 
     between the click on the URL and the returned cgi-test page.
     
     I am certain that my directory aliases and rights etc are correctly 
     set up for my standalone httpd server. The access_log shows that the 
     script is being reached and dummy text HTML inserted in various parts 
     of the cgi-test script show that it is being axecuted and that it 
     recognises that arguments have been appended. A version problem 
     perhaps ?

  Sure:

  Inspection of the http specifications indicates the From: field be in 
Internet Mail Format and is supposed to give the name of the requesting user.  
Additionally, it recommends, but not require, that the address be valid.
Provided that the loci of control over contents of the From: field rests
on the client with the user, one can easily see where this field can be
used to support Chom's notion of multiple aliases and provide session tracking. 

  For example, a user upon start up of their WWW Browser for the first time
is asked to configure the From: field as part of the preferences which are 
currently configurable.  The user has the option of providing a real/valid 
address, or a bogus identification number.  This information accompanies 
requests and can be used by servers to customize information and track users 
across sessions.   Multi-user platforms that are not access controlled (e.g. 
Macs and PCs) can still be supported by providing browser level support for 
multiple aliases across multiple users.

  Now let's say that the user is not happy with the customization of the 
information/services provided by a server - it is the user who can reset 
the profiling and not be subjected to rigid server-side user models.  
Another scenario would be where the client keeps a table of aliases used for 
interactions with servers and allows the user to switch roles/aliases.  Here, 
the client could be used to generate unique client side ids.  And 
broadcasting of real identification is managed by the user.

  The downside with both being you may get name/id space collisions from 
clients behind the same gateway/firewall.  Following the 80/20 rule, I'd
argue that the majority of traffic will be correctly handled and that 
session id tracking is not a situation where 100/0 is required.  Where 
better assurance is needed to ensure the same user across each and every 
session, other mechanisms within http can be used.

  Of course there is the issue of session id management. Generous estimates 
(20 million users with 60,000 WWW servers) indicate that 1.2 x 10^12 possible
ids would need to be maintained by either the client or the server if every 
relation requires a different id.  In practice though, a user may have say 
10 aliases or so. Therefore each client would need to manage 600,000 ids for 
all WWW servers whereas each WWW server would need to maintain 1.3 x 10^13 ids.
Note that if you argue that each client will not interact with all servers,
this constant applies to both equations and therefore cancels, so the difference
in magnitudes remains the same.  An assumption being made here is that there 
will be always be more users than servers, which seems reasonable. So it seems 
from this approach that the latter solution (server-side) generation of 
sessions ids does not scale as well as client-side id/alias management, 
regardless of the loci of control approach argued above.

I'm away, so take your time in replying.

Jim.

True, but I'm not sure what your objection is.  In the vast majority of
cases, object rendering time is inconsequential compared to network lag and
client rendering time.  Being able to incrementally render client side isn't
that big of a win; the time difference between streaming to the client as
the object is rendering and waiting until it is done before sending is no
more than a few tenths of a second at the greatest and does not
substantially affect perceived performance.  In any case, this model is
unavoidable because in many cases, dynamic objects do not follow a linear
rendering flow; that is to say, I can't properly render the top until I've
processed all the data for the object.

There is a possible exception for heavily loaded servers that take on the
order of seconds to render objects; in this case, there would be a
noticeable difference is response time.  In that case, since you're working
with dynamic objects, just distribute the buggers to reduce server load.
Clean, simple, and cheap.

Hmmm, I just considered objects that inherently take a long time to render
regardless of server load (databases and such).  My objects aren't like that
(yet), so I haven't had to deal with it.  In that case, you would indeed
want some mechanism to present some feedback to the user early; in this
case, we will obviously need some kind of boundary or packetized data
scheme; no getting around that, I suspect, if we want accurate entity-body
delimiting.

I'm not sure how they could fail to envision that usage and have it work at
all, but okay.

Great. BTW, I recently reported to NCSA that they don't check the number of
aliases and if the number overflows the default (20 total Aliases and
ScriptAliases) they overwrite memory randomly. Do you know if that is fixed
in Apache?

Right, and certainly would if I could. Apache soulds like an excellent
solution, but it does require getting our site providers to switch to it.

I don't see the distinction there.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

Surely the nicest way to do this would be to enhance the stylesheet spec
(if it doesn't provide for it already) so that links of specific
relation types can be modified seperately to the general class of links.
 E.g. all links should look blue, but links.Annotation should be
paleblue, blah, blah.

You might even be able to go so far as to say, I'm only interested in
links of class "Subdocument", so only highlight those and make all
others non-lighted (as 'twere).

I better clarify (4) - i would like to retreive all URL from
a site, but according to (4), have minimum time between two
GETs as to avoid overloading the server. 

Answers to the query:

A). http://www.inria.fr/koala/abaird/oscheme/oscheme.html with
    the  "www-list" scripts (from Anselm.Baird_Smith@inria.fr)

B). http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/MOMspider/ (MOMspider)
    (from joshuap@sdsc.edu (Joshua Polterock))

C). http://iamwww.unige.ch/~scg/Src/Scripts/  with the
    explore script (diana@seldon.terminus.com (Cookie Monster))

D). Simon Spero <ses@tipper.oit.unc.edu> have a set of programs 
    for benmarking.

E). rst@ai.mit.edu (Robert S. Thau) has written a logfile replay program,
    runs SunOS, which reports the main latency for every 100 transactions,
    and which handle multiple outstanding requests. Found at
    ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/rst/monkey.c

F). www2dot from einpost@win.tue.nl (Reinier Post), it might no
    fill the (4) requirement. Contact Reiner Post. Based on libwww2.

BTW, I probably try to use (C). For those interested, i'm running
a gateway (CGI based), which generates HTML pages on the fly. 
I'm interested the above to profile the gateway (written in C).

thanks to all who answered,

That's not sufficient. Mosaic still caches inline images in
memory and does to pay attention to and Expires header coming with
the image.

I've written my own Web server.  (Doesn't everyone? :-)  Unlike the
public domain servers I've seen, I don't time out sends (in response to
GET, for example).

I've observed that my server process sometimes hangs after a
transaction is complete, waiting for a TCP connection to shut down.
(On Unix systems, in the close() following shutdown().) I've looked at
the logs to try to associate this failing with particular client
programs or operating systems or remote hosts, but it seems pretty
general.

For now I've been forced to timeout the shutdown after 10 minutes.  But
I suspect there's an OS bug (on my side?:  SGI IRIX 5.2) in the area of
connection shutdown.  (I believe the send timeout on the other servers
handles this problem along the way.)

Can anyone shed any light on the problem and/or its solution?

I was reading a rather old issue of InformationWeek (Apr 10/95) about 
Netscape and Adobe's agreement to add Acrobat to Navigator 1.1. Well, 
1.1N is out but I don't see any sign of Acrobat.

Anyone heard about this?

I am looking for a place to find Viewers of documents like Adobe's Acrobat,
Does anybody know where (apart from Acrobat), I can find viewer 
that enable to exchange documents, running under UNIX System V.4?
Is there a forum discussing these?

Table of Contents

     * Overview
     * The byterange Parameter
          + Examples
     * The Range HTTP Response Header
          + Examples
     * Miscellaneous
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Overview

   There are number of Web applications that would benefit from being
   able to request the server to give a byte range of a document. It may
   be argued that this should be left as a server-specific feature in the
   opaque URL, as the "parameters" used in URLs that may be available or
   useful can vary from server to server. However, there are reasons why
   standardizing the byte range feature would be beneficial.
   
   One of the primary reasons is to be able to support byte ranges in
   proxy servers. Without a standard proxy servers will have to treat
   each different byte range of a given document as a separate document.
   Should the notion of a byte range be standard, not only would it
   prevent portions of documents to be multiply cached, but it would make
   it possible for the server to generate range responses directly from
   its cache.
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Description of the byterange URL Parameter

     * The byte range request is attached to the end of the URL,
       separated by a semi-colon.
       
     * The parameter name is byterange.
       
     * The range is two integers greater than zero, separated by a
       hyphen.
       
     * The first byte in file is byte number 1.
       
     * One of the numbers may be missing, but both of them cannot at the
       same time.
       
     * If the first number is missing, it means to return n bytes from
       the end of the file, where n is the second number.
       
     * If the second number is missing, it means the end of file.
       
     * If the second number is larger than the size of the file, it is
       taken to mean the size of the file.
       
     * The first integer must always be less than or equal to the second
       one.
       
     * The range includes both limits, that is, a range 500-1000 means
       the 501 bytes between 499 and 1001.
       
     * There may be multiple ranges, separated by a comma. The order of
       the ranges is the preferred order in which the ranges should be
       returned.
       
     * In place of a range there may be only a single positive integer.
       This means only a single byte. This is not meaningful for byte
       ranges, but if and when this scheme gets extended to allow other
       kinds of ranges (such as lines, chapters or pages), this will be
       useful.
       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
  EXAMPLES OF THE BYTERANGE URL PARAMETER
  
   The first 500 bytes:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=1-500

   The second 500 bytes:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=501-1000

   Bytes from 501 until the end of file:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=501-

   The last 500 bytes of the file:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=-500

   Two separate ranges:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=51-100,201-250

   The first 100 bytes, 1000 bytes starting from the byte number 500, and
   the remainder of the file starting from byte number 4000:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=1-100,500-1499,4000-

   The first 100 bytes, 1000 bytes starting from the byte number 500, and
   the last 200 bytes of the file:

        http://host/dir/foo;byterange=1-100,500-1499,-200

   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Description of the HTTP Response Headers

   If the request includes multiple ranges, the response is sent back as
   a multipart MIME message.
   
   If there are overlapping ranges the behaviour for each range doesn't
   change. That is, a range will not be truncated, or left out, just
   because there is an overlap.
   
   The following HTTP response header is sent back to provide
   verification and information about the range and total size of the
   file:

        Range: bytes X-Y/Z

   where:
   X
          is the number of the first byte returned (the first byte is
          byte number one).
          
   Y
          is the number of the last byte returned (in case of the end of
          the file this is the same number as the size of the file in
          bytes).
          
   Z
          is the total size of the file in bytes.

   There are other kinds of ranges that can be addressed in a similar

   extend them. This byte range specification applies to any
   content-type. There may be range schemes that are meaningful to only
   certain types of documents.
   
   As an example, there might be a linerange URL parameter, with the same
   kind of range specification, and the Range: header would then specify
   the numbers in lines. Example:

        http://host/dir/foo;linerange=21-30

   The response from a 123 line file would be:

        Range: lines 21-30/123

   This could be useful for such things as structured text files like
   address lists or digests of mail and news, but isn't meaningful to
   such document types as GIF or PDF.
   
   Other examples might be document format specific ranges, such as
   chapters:

        http://host/dir/foo;chapterrange=1-3

        Range: chapters 1-3/12

   Or just the first chapter:

        http://host/dir/foo;chapterrange=1

        Range: chapters 1/12

  MULTIPLE URL PARAMETERS
  
   If at some point there will be multiple simultaneous URL parameters,
   they should be separated by the ampersand character (just like
   multiple values are encoded in the FORM request).

We have been putting off the problem of fragment identifiers, and this
is a good start on the problem. I have a few reflex objections about
details - such as preferring 0-based addressing to 1-based - but they
are very minor. My major objection is that I would like to see
byterange addressing as one component in a more general fragment
identification architecture. The "Miscellaneous" section, quoted below,
mentions the possibility of combining different addressing schemes, but
does not provide any specification. I would be a LOT happier if we
could have an overall scheme that byterange, paragraph, row/col, word,
stanza, and other addressing schemes could fit into.

For example, I might want queries such as:

 Get the value of the <title> element in an HTML file
 http://host/path;generic-id="title"

 Get bytes 1-5 of the second paragraph of a file
 http://host/path;para=2&byterange=1-5

 Get a portion of a JPEG
 http://host/path.jpg;rows=37-99&cols=53-200


When we start looking at the addressing needs of a variety of
specifiers (rows/cols, paragraphs, ...) then we may find that
we would prefer different choices of index base, inclusion or
exclusion of the elements at the extremes of the range, etc.

We need to define more than just the syntax of how multiple
parameters will be seperated. We need to define the semantics
of foo=n1-n2&bar=n3-n4. Does the "bar" parameter apply to the
result of the "foo" parameter? Vice versa? Or do we return the
two selections seperately the way you specify with foo=n1-n2,n3-n4  ?

How are errors to be handled when we specify a range that is
longer than the file? What about when the starting offset of
the range is greater than the length of the file? 

Byteranges are pretty nice since they are broadly applicable,
but I am not sure what it means to ask for a byterange of
a database. This problem is even more acute when we get into
parameters such as "paragraph", "row/col", "stanza", etc.
How are we to indicate when a parameter is inappropriate for
a URL, such as paragraph for an image? Usually row/col
will be inappropriate for HTML files, but if we have previously
selected a table then it is the natural way to get a table
element. How do we do that?

If we do not develop a uniform architecture for fragment
identification, we are going to have a slew of partial solutions before
we wise up and develop a uniform treatment. Then everyone will be
pissed because of differing addressing conventions, code bloat, etc.
and a total inability to make the uniform scheme match the previous
partial solutions.

My understanding is that HyTime can handle this uniform
fragment identification. Can people knowledgeable about HyTime
talk about the good *and bad* points of using HyTime addressing
for URI fragment identification? Is there a way we can
start small, with just byterange selection, then grow our
capabilities?

The ampersand character has odd interactions with SGML entity
reference syntax in HTML.

This URL:

	http://host/path;param1=val1&param2=val2

has to be written:

	<a href="http://host/path;param1=val1&#38;param2=val2">xxx</a>
	<a href="http://host/path;param1=val1&amp;param2=val2">xxx</a>

in HTML.

I suggest you separate parameters with ';' in stead:

	<a href="http://host/path;param1=val1;param2=val2">xxx</a>

Save everybody a little grief.

Could someone please give a quick justification for adding the ability

such an explanation in the original proposal.  Thanks!

Base 0 is fine for bytes but would be problematic for other ranges.
E.g. 

	http://host/book;chapterrange=3-5

would mean chapters 4 to 6 if base 0 is used.  This would be just too
confusing.  We thought it better to be consistent and use the same
base for everything.

I don't think this is relevant: http should be kept simple and data-type
independent, leave out the higher level semantics.  Then 0 based
addressing is the most sensible.  Even for chapters, the argument is
weak: what chapter number is the title page?  What chapter number
applies to appendicies?  Does the number then need to be a string that
names a sub-entity?  This is a Pandora's Box that should stay closed.

Any thought on how this should interect with dynamic computed documents
(CGI-bin scripts)?  Supporting range addressing of computed documents
would require either re-computation on each fetch, or caching.  If
re-computed, how do you guarantee consistancy?  Imagine fetching a
document one byte at a time that contains the server's load average.

The proposal in general sounds pretty reasonable to me.  It's not unlike
fragment proposals submitted for other applications (eg, Z39.50), but
I think the timing and especially the simplicity of this one favors it.

Without getting much more complicated, you might want to handle the case
when the server doesn't know the size, as when a file is growing.

Multiple ranges make me a little squeamish because you have to think about
packaging ranges in the (single) response.  For example, do you concatenate
all the returned ranges, and let the client count bytes to figure out where
range boundaries are?  (Things get weird fast when you move beyond bytes
into, say, paragraphs.)

If you stick with multiple ranges you might let the server be pig-headed
about them and return them in the order that's most convenient.  Good taste
dictates that it will do what's requested, but offers protection from some
pathological cases.  Reliability can be assured if the header reports back
to the client what the server ended up doing.

Specter, Inc. is proud to announce the immediate availability 
of WebWatch 1.0 for Windows. WebWatch is a tool for keeping 
track of changes in selected Web documents.

Given an HTML document referencing URLs on the Web, WebWatch 
produces a filtered list, containing only those URLs that have 
been modified since a given time.

The input file can be e.g.
- the bookmark file of Netscape; or 
- the exported (to HTML format) hotlist of Mosaic; or 
- any other, standard HTML document, edited locally or 
retrieved from the Web.

The time used for filtering
- can be given as a global setting that applies to all URLs, or 
- WebWatch can derive it automatically, using the time of your 
last visit to the document, as recorded by your Web browser in 
your local HTML (bookmark) file.

WebWatch generates a local HTML document that contains links to 
only those documents which were updated after the given date. 
You can load this document into any Web browser and use it to 
navigate to the updated documents.

WebWatch stores its arguments in a parameter file. Once you 
have customized the program to your needs, using its graphical 
front-end, you can have it run in unattended mode, periodically.

WebWatch supports the use of proxy servers.

WebWatch is currently available for every (16 and 32 bit) 
Windows platforms.

WebWatch is shareware. Single user registration after 30 days 
evaluation is US $18. We offer free registration for every new 
bug found.

I see a potential problem with using '?' because it is already used
for forms.  What happens if someone has a form with a field named
"byterange"?  We are better off having the name space for form fields
separate from that of URL parameters.

I generally agree with this, though I might not have put it so strongly.
On the other hand it is fine for servers to implement server specific 
parameters with special meaning for that server.  There are a number of
such in the server that I wrote.  If, as in the case of byterange, it
turns out that several implementors want the same functionality it makes
sense to try to standardize.

but I still ask:

Please give a single, specific and realistic example. If you think a
framemaker document can be retrieved a byte range at a time, what is
the initial byte range? How do you know?

Can PDF documents be retrieved partially? A priori? How many bytes
would you know to ask for in the first place? Is 'the first part of a
PDF file' still 'application/pdf'?

This is http specific, isn't it? Surely a FTP server won't support
this. So, does this belong in the URL at all? 

I think these are both scenarios that might benefit from a GET-PARTIAL
or some kind of modification to GET in HTTP, but I don't see either of
these scenarios being justification for a new feature in URLs.

telnet://host;byterange=1-5?

The discussion seems to have confounded fragment identifiers (where
the URL points to a part of another object, but the request is 'get
the whole object, but direct attention to this part') with some kind
of 'partial object retrieval' (retrieve this other resource which is a
particular subpiece of the original one.)

Fragment identifiers occur after #, but the ';' separator is reserved
in a variety of URL schemes. Unless you intend this to only work with
HTTP? That isn't what the proposal said.

We are making available to WWW developers the experimental prototype
implementation which we developed as a vehicle for our research into a
scalable architecture for a generalized form of "group annotations".

Usages which we have found this useful for include structured
discussion about paper drafts, collaborative filtering, seals of
approval/content rating, all sorts of guided tours, shared hotlists
with section-based visibility control, usage indicators, co-presence,
and "Vannevar Bush type" value-added trails.

The code is a couple of months of work by two people.  It has been used 
mainly on RS6000s, but should also work on other machines.

Server Code: a system of cgi-bin scripts implemented in perl.

Browser Code: a derivative product of NCSA xMosaic. Extensions include

 - facilities for shared in-place annotations to arbitrary HTML document
   (including dynamically allocated extended/brief menus),
 - a META language module which parses meta information and deals with
   appropriate callback routines.
 - a user profile server which allows users to store their personal 
   configuration (including personal preferences and the hotlist) at a
   place where they can always reach it. (This "base station" is an 
   extended http server.) 
 - a light-weight viewing facility for looking at meta information 
   including annotations (a PostIt type popup window activated by 
   pressing the middle button), 
 - navigational aids (callbacks to a tour/map program, another HTML 
   widget in main layout for title/link display, augmented HTML parser 
   which recognizes the LINK tag), as well as 
 - a facility for printing collections of linked documents in Postscript. 
 - various fixes to and variations on Mosaic.

Please note that this "release" is not intended for general users; it
is targeted at letting other developers get a more tangible experience
beyond the papers which we have published.  Also, since the primary
purpose of the implementation was to explore new ideas and concepts,
we do not maintain the code and also do not give any guarantees.

For a description of the system, see the paper

  Platform for Third-Party Value-Added Providers: Architecture,
  Protocols, and Usage Examples.  Technical Report, Computer Science
  Department, Stanford University. 
Available at URL http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/COMMENTOR/.

The code is also available from a link at this page, or directly at

I'm getting this discussion 3 times, http-wg, www-talk, and now on
uri.  I suggest keeping the discussion on www-talk for now.

The proposal is to add byte ranges to URLs (in general, it seems). I
don't think it belongs there; at best, byte ranges make sense as an
addon to the HTTP protocol.

I like this very much as it permits implementation of something like
FTP's REGET .. possibility to resume on broken TCP links...

Ari Luotonen typeth:
|         http://host/dir/foo;byterange=1-500
|         http://host/dir/foo;linerange=21-30
|         http://host/dir/foo;chapterrange=1-3

Something not very important, but I'd like to have something cozier
to type, so I suggest this:

     http://host/dir/foo;bytes=1-500
     http://host/dir/foo;lines=21-30
     http://host/dir/foo;chapters=1-3

Think it looks a little less technical...

Are you suggesting that instead of an addressing schema,
one should focus instead on a naming schema for parts,
the mapping of which would be left to the server ?


That is, servers could provide part identifiers
instead of part addresses, and client could query
those identifiers.

I guess I don't see a problem here. If byte ranges don't apply to data
stored in your server, why would you ever have to worry about URLs
requesting them? Why should your server ever receive them, and why
shouldn't it just ignore them?

First, let me say that as far as I am concerned we are discussing
byte ranges for HTTP URLs, not for every URL.  I assumed this was
understood.  I, at least, am not suggesting changes to ftp or gopher
URLs.

Secondly, a couple of people have expressed concern over "making this
a requirement."  I am not sure what this even means.  No server is
ever "required" to honor any request.  Requests are routinely denied
and there are HTTP status codes to communicate information about the
denial.   The fact that a URL

	http://host/path/foo

is honored in no way implies that the *different* URL 

	http://host/path/foo;byterange=1-500

is required also to be honored.  It is quite acceptable to return an
"access denied" status for the second URL.  Parameters like byterange
while very useful in some applications are useless, meaningless, hard
to serve, or even impossible to serve in other cases.  We can all come
up with our favorite example.  When a byterange is requested in such
an instance the server should simply refuse the request with an
appropriate status code.  If a server does not support byteranges
(e.g. most current servers) and receives a request for one it will
presumably send a "file does not exist" status code.  This is fine.

I'd also like to see something more general.  (I'd also like to see something
integrated with, rather than orthogonal to, existing fragment references
but that's just me.)

This also has interesting potential to allow hacks like the extra anchor

You can do that today with Gopher URLs; this vulnerability has been known
about for years, popular browsers are susecptible to it, and nobody seems to
be complaining, so obviously it's not a real problem. :-) * 0.5

This originally sounded like it was a proposal for a new form of URL.
Now, it looks like it is a proposal for a convention among HTTP
servers -- like CGI -- which HTTP server implementations could either
include or not, with the client completely unaware. The only issue is
whether proxy servers might be aware of the convention and deal with
overlapping byte ranges.

Except for the case of extracting individual segments out of larger
ascii files, though, I'm having trouble thinking of any real examples
of this, and, in particular, any examples where the documents aren't
text/plain.

You would have to ask the PDF experts (e.g. Adobe).  However, if you saw the
demo (or heard about it) at the Seybold publishing conference, it was done
there.  We (Adobe & Netscape) demonstrated a prototype browser implementation
which treated PDF as a first class object and included streaming and byte range
retreival via server CGI.  Ari is simply attempting (for Netscape) to help
create a standard means of doing this very common procedure so that there are
not 100's of different implementations -- the other very positive aspect
(especially from Ari's point of view) is that if there is a standard way of
doing it, his proxy can understand it...(and cache it...etc...etc...)

One problem with a new method or a Header based method is that it breaks
all existing proxy setups...

Patience is a virtue. I wouldn't expect anything quite so soon, but I'd bet
that a forthcoming version of the browser will show signs of the recently
announced Adobe-Netscape arrangement.

Absolutely no support for fragmentation: MPEG audio and video (I realized
this after using MPEG files as an example in my post last night - ack) I
would be willing to bet most other recent formats fit this description. 
Also: GIF, JPEG, others.  Most of these formats have smart readers which 
can *recover* at some point into the stream (sorta like when you turn 
your TV on and it's fuzzy for a second or two), so "no support for 
fragmentation" doesn't mean "a subpart doesn't mean anything".

Minimal support for fragmentation (i.e., there are places where the object
can be split): PDF, Quicktime (certain codecs), HTML (?), 
"mailbox-message" format plain text.

Completely fragmentable: plain text, aiff, wav, and mu-law sound formats.  
Basically, any unstructured and uncompressed file formats, which also 
happens to be the least useful type of file.


To repeat: just because a file's fragments aren't valid file types on 
their own doesn't mean they're not useful.  They might be valid in the 
context of some other file type which has inlined them.  For example, 
let's say I have an HTML file like this:

..
   An example of VRML:
   <PRE>
   <A REL="EMBED" HREF="http://host/foo.wrl?byterange=22342-22401"></A>
   </PRE>

Whereas the object representation the URL pointed to was not a valid VRML 
file, and thus was not typed VRML, but was perfectly embeddable in HTML.

Thoughts?

One last thing I'd like to throw into the conversation here, and then I 
feel all has been said that needs to be said, and we should try and find 
rough consensus. (BTW, are there any "tools" for finding what 
can be considered rough consensus?  A straight WWW-based poll is 
probably out of line...)

************************************************************************
SUMMARY: all we really need, standards-wise, is a new 300-level HTTP 
response, "Contains".
************************************************************************

Several good examples have been brought up of files that can be comprised of
segments, where each of those segments is a valid file of the same data-type,
as an argument for this proposal.  However, in almost all of the examples,
there were only *specific* byte ranges which would work, in which the
requested object would really be usable.  Thus, for most of these examples,
you could just ask for "parts 0-3" or "2-5" or "3-end", and the right thing
would happen.  In only one of the examples was *true* random access
necessary, and that was to resume downloading of a file if it was interrupted
part of the way through.  Keep this example off to the side for the next few
paragraphs. 

Instead of thinking about one URL that represents a collection of objects,
why not give each object their own unique URL, and devise a way of addressing
a collection of URL's?  This is similar to byterange, but more general. 
Let's say somewhere a mapping takes place that translates URL1 into a
container for URL2, URL3, URL4, etc.  I have a hunch this is URC/URI
territory, but I don't know enough yet about the specific URC proposals
floating around yet to know if this is already being considered. 

So, it works like this:

Client asks for URL1. URL1 gets mapped at a server somewhere into a composite
body whose parts are URL2, URL3, and URL4. * If it doesn't find a place to
either inline or link URL3, URL4, etc., it's up to the browser to figure out
how to represent that "auxiliary" file.  Maybe it just keeps it around until
it can be represented later. 

Caches work just as they always have.  If they can cache that container 
mapping, so much the better.  The important thing is that URL2, URL3, 
URL4, etc., can be ANYTHING THEY WANT TO BE - there's no need to give 
them some sort of formal syntax, caches know from the mapping from URL1 
how they assemble together.  If the server prefers knowing them as 
byteranges, it doesn't matter.  I.e., we can have

  http://host/path/file 
    is-a-container-for
      http://host/path/file;byterange=0-30
      http://host/path/file;byterange=31-60

or

  http://host/path/file
    is-a-container-for
      http://host/path/file?part1
      http://host/path/file?part2

or even

  http://host/path/file
    is-a-container-for
      http://host/path/file2
      http://host2/path/script
      ftp://host3/path/file3

and either way the client or proxy will know when it has the whole 
object, or just its parts.

Finally, this also allows "parts" to be members of more than one 
container, something none of the byterange proposals had considered.  I 
think this is a good thing, can anyone think of a situation where this 
isn't?  In fact they can even be on completely separate servers.


Yes, THIS REQUIRES CHANGES TO BROWSERS AND SERVERS.  Minimally.  Why 
are we so afraid of that?

There are a couple really good side effects now that I think about it.
For example, right now Netscape's progressive-rendering algorithm has to 
wait until it recognizes a reference to an inlined image before it can 
start grabbing it.  If it could be told that "URL1 contains this HTML 
page and these inlined images" then it could possibly be more efficient 
in what it does.  Additionally, a content provider could "bundle" icons 
with one page that weren't necessarily inlined on that page, but which 
are used by subsequent pages, so that when visitors go to that subsequent 
page, the icons are already loaded.

I can give plenty of examples of how this could work for just about 
every application discussed so far.  It would seem to be pretty 
straightforward for servers to generate these mappings for a large PDF 
file, presuming there's some way for it to query the PDF file to know 
where it can be segmented.

So, now, back to the resume-downloading-at-point-x.  This is 
semantically a much different operation than "give me part x",
so let's just give it its own request header:

Startbyte: 204567

...would mean start the post-response-header transmission at byte 204567 into
the response, counting from the end of the response headers (\r\n\r\n, or
\n\n).  Who cares if this is a CGI script or actual file, eh?  :)


********************************************************************

So, I suppose in the end I'm proposing a new 300-level HTTP header, 
something like

  305 Contains Mapping

     o Following: anything
  
     o Required Headers: none

  The server returns an HTTP object comprised of a newline-delimited 
  list of URI's which this URL is said to "contain".  The client is expected
  to fetch these URL's and plug them together, representing this 
  requested URL as the canonical URL for this collection.  The other HTTP 
  headers on this object apply *only* to this object, and this response 
  should be cached where possible.

*******************************************************************

*Feedback*, please.  I hate having all these ideas and no time to 
implement them in a browser (though I'd be happy to implement this on the 
server side in Apache).

Roy?  Dan?  Henrik?

	Brian

brian@organic.com  brian@hyperreal.com  http://www.[hyperreal,organic].com/


* - Order is insignificant - a browser first starts rendering URL2 and looks
for where to start plugging in URL3, etc, but that should just be an
optimization, browsers can plug things together however they wish.  Some
network-aware file formats like VRML already have the concept of nesting
inlines, which HTML doesn't have (yet), so that order could to be
created by a depth- or breadth-first traversal of the scene to aid 
rendering, but in a real directed graph that's not necessary.

A very good proposal and it's nice to have it published and
discussed before it is implemented! This is the way Netscape Comm.
should always take.

Some minor points follow:


>Description of the byterange URL Parameter
>
>     * The byte range request is attached to the end of the URL,
>       separated by a semi-colon.

What is the "end of an URL"? In

	<http://foo/bar?blah>

where is the "end"? Is it before the question mark or behind
"blah". Would a byterange URL be

	<http://foo/bar;byterange=4-44?blah>

or
	<http://foo/bar?blah;byterange=4-44?blah>

I'd prefer the former one because it integrates much more smothly
with existing applications.


>     * The first byte in file is byte number 1.

What is a file? There's not necessarily a file behind a URL, and to
the client this should be totally transparent. Let's call it
document or (even more general) entity.

As other responses indicate, it is more or less a matter of
taste whether to start with 0 or 1. Just pick one (not necessarily
1 :-)) and go for it.

>   they should be separated by the ampersand character (just like
>   multiple values are encoded in the FORM request).

Oh no, please don't pick the ampersand because of its SGMLish
implications!


BTW, some food for more thinking: It may be useful to invent some
notation for set operations, like
<http://foo/bar;(chapterrange=5-12)-((chapterrange=8)+byterange=100-1500))>

I do not like the idea of byte ranges being part of a URL.
In DynaWeb for example

   http://www.ebt.com/collection/readers?byterange=1-500

is absolutely meaningless, because the actual file size is not
related to the size of the documents retrieved. Worse even,
there are cases (and DynaWeb is one) where a single URL
can possibly reference documents that differ in an
arbitrary manner.

In other words, byte ranges are not generally applicable to
all objects accessible via a URL, so we cannot make this
a requirement.

How about adding another method instead?

I've been meaning to write up an RFC on how DynaWeb handles large
files. As I've said, DynaWeb breaks a document into parts based on the
structure of the data. In particular, DynaWeb does runtime conversion
from SGML to HTML, and the smallest addressable part of a document in
DynaWeb is a single SGML element.

As you all probably know, an SGML document basically forms a
heirarchy of nested elements, or in other words, a tree. Filesystems,
in general, are also trees. It seemed natural to me to use the same
*type* of URL for files, and for sub-document addressing.

As such, DynaWeb actually supports 3 sub=document addressing modes,
which are pretty much taken straight from the TEI guidelines:

   http://www.ebt.com/collection/book/doc=1/chap=2/sect=3
   http://www.ebt.com/collection/book/1/2/3
   http://www.ebt.com/collection/book/1

The first form accesses elements in the heirarchy by *typed* child
number, the second form accesses elements based on child number,
irrespective of type, and the last is a direct element address. In
practice, because few people ever access the server except by
browsing, the last form can be used in most cases. I would like to
argue that such an addressing scheme is applicable to many other types
of data as well.   

As I said before, my real problem with byte-ranges is that generally,
they don't make sense. Ranges of *parts* does make sense however. One
other problem I have is that the format of a URL should really be
application dependent, so why make recommendations for cases where it
is meaningless? Let's leave it to the application (ie. the server),
until we are ready to design a far more general linking mechanism.

Loot at http://www.ebt.com/ to see how DynaWeb works.

PS. I should note that the above naming scheme is very, very useful in
our case, but it drives spiders wild....

But I prefer the URL method much more, as it makes perfectly sense to
request a part of a binary from an FTP server, or just the signature of
a news posting, or a range in a gopher text file.

I like common syntax ("methods" in OOP).. even if the semantics differ
slightly.. whatever seems applicable sounds like a good choice to me.
I wouldn't want it in the headers.

And no, I don't want to explain every netscape user how to download using

Explain every user how to ftp from mirrors?
We're working on that, but the number of net newbies is growing too fast.

which might be a clever rejoinder, except that the proposal doesn't
actually solve the problem. That is, this is not a proposal for
finishing a partial transmission when the original transmission
failed, and there doesn't seem to be any practical way to use URL byte
ranges to implement retransmission after failure.


> Explain every user how to ftp from mirrors?
> We're working on that, but the number of net newbies is growing too fast.

Whether there are a lot of net newbies is irrelevant to the question
of whether the proposal to include byte ranges in URLs is useful.

Dear All,


I am having difficulties in setting password control on our server (CERN HTTP 3.0
running on SUNOS 4.1.3_U1).

I have followed the User Guide instructions in detail, and have tried
setting up both the 'Embedded Protection setup in the Configuration File'
and the 'ACL' Setup.

With the Embedded protection, the server when initialised acknowledges that
certain file areas have protection set for them, but when that area is
accessed, the server (running in Verbose Mode) says that no protection has
been set up.

When using the ACL protection Methodology, all users are locked out of the
area.

Also, the User Guide only defines 'basic' as a legal 'AuthType' variable -
what other possibilities are there?

Has Anybody had similar problems to these? Does anybody know of any solutions?

Thanks,

Adam

Hi,

I have home pages, and on each one, i used to have a "back" and "forward"
button as imagemaps. My problem is that imagine i have 3 pages named A, B and
C.html that lead to a D.html page; on the last one, the "back" button *must*
know which page the user came from...
Is there an environment variable to describe such a situation?

Thanks in advance

I'm attempting to implement a clean version of HTTPD on the NetWare
(4.x) OS.  I have a daemon up and running now, (the easy part), and I
have rudimentary (if temporary) file transfers working for playing with
the server.  Works pretty good if I do say so myself!

Before I dive in any deeper, there is a concept or two that I need to
understand before I start designing the URL parsing mechanism.

First, what is the magic mime type:  text/x-server-parsed-html

>From my perusing of the NCSA source, this is some sort of INCLUDE
functionality, but I can't decipher what INCLUDE is all about, can an HTML
document include others to be sent along inline?  If so, what is the
general algorithm for parsing the include list, that is, how to you know
what these other files are?

Thanks!

  As long as that sort of query at the _user level_ maps exactly, this is
  fine with me.  (I think that something akin to the above "chapterrange=3-5" 
  should actually mean what it seems to, at that level.)

Yes, but that just let's me tell them what to stay away from. The issue
here is not that they should stay away, but that I should recognize them.
The permissions file is not fetched everytime they come around, and the
spacing between visits tends to be long (to reduce load on any one system),
and I can't just flag anyone who fetches robot.txt as a robot, since of
course a person may fetch it too.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

Hi,

I have talked to a few browser developers about this issue and 
would also like to get the opinions of this list. The question
is - what should be the known URL for any web node?

For example, if a node has this base statement: 
	<base href="http://www.hp.com/go/AccessGuide">

while the actual file location for this node is: 
	{htdocs}/AccessGuide/AccessGuide.html. 

and most readers access this node via an imagemap redirect:
	"rect /AccessGuide/AccessGuide.html 56,364  162,393"

When the node is reached, what location should browsers display 
to the user and use in hot lists?
  http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/ahp/ahpAccessHP.map?106,379
   or
  http://www.hp.com/AccessGuide/AccessGuide.html
   or
  http://www.hp.com/go/AccessGuide

I have seen browsers use all three forms: 
	how I got there, 
	where I was redirected, 
	what the node says it is.


This is real important to me (and I suspect the web community) because 
we wish to help users maintain their links to our material. Clearly, 
the first form is the hardest for me to maintain.  All URLS in the 
document are server relative so there is no issue about relative paths.

It seems to me that the known location for a node should be under 
control of the server/document author not the browser/reader.  If 
not, how is a developer going to help readers maintain links to 
the developer's site? 

Regards,
Dave Hollander

And of course not all robots will fetch robot.txt, either.  Welcome to

Fair enough. I'd also like to recognise them, and some kind of
convention in User-Agent or somesuch seems desirable. 

Putting a robot on our server is a great way of stress-testing it ;-)

The last is the most important, being the author's statement of how they

Hi,

I have some problems regarding caching that I hope someone here will
have some good suggestions how to solve.  I've already read the
discussion on http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/caching.html, and it
didn't really help very much.

The problem is that the current round of browsers and the
current protocol do not seem to interact very smoothly when it comes
to caching pages.  I'll explain what I mean:

The "expires" feature should cover the issue of when pages should be
flushed, but the world is apparently not ready for it, because:

- If you set documents to expire immediately, some major browsers
display "Data Missing" or equivalently scary messages when you use
browser commands to "back up" to that page.  Since many users are not
going to understand what is going on and will be confused by such
messages, and may not know to "reload" the page at that point, it
would be better for them never to see messages like that.  (I've
already had problems with some naive beta testers tripping over that.
They tend to think something must have broken.  You can't argue that
we need more sophisticated users, because we don't have a choice!)

- Some browsers (such as Prodigy's) appear to ignore the "expires" header 
and cache pages anyway.  (and that's just their *browser*...)

So, I have a question and I have suggestions.

First, the question:

Is there any good workaround for the current problem, that would have
the properties of:
- forcing browsers to reload expired pages when someone explicitly requests
  one, and
- either:
  - allowing pages on the browser's history stack (for instance) to remain
    in the local cache even if they are expired, or, 
  - *somehow* causing the browsers to gracefully and silently reload 
    expired pages when re-visited through history mechanisms.

No?  I suspected as much...

The suggestions:

To make the web work more smoothly, it would be nice if browsers would
handle this situation more gracefully, by, for instance, not displaying
errors like "Data Missing", but just automatically reloading the page.

However, I also think it is worth considering for browser writers that
history stacks (that can be re-viewed with browser navigation
controls) are in a class of their own when it comes to caching.
However, while it might make sense to back up and see an expired
document, since history mechanisms are for "history", it does not make
sense to go through a link and see a cached copy of an expired
document.  It is REALLY BAD for browsers to display cached copies of
expired documents when they are meant to be freshly displayed in
response to a direct user command, because a URL may be a request to a
program that is displaying dynamic information related to the user's
extended "session" with the server.  (This is the core of the issue).

I realize these considerations may have no role in the HTTP spec,
however I feel there are serious problems in this area, which can only
be resolved by coordinating the behavior of browsers and servers.

Another thing that might help: perhaps there should be a way for
servers to "force" the URL (the *name*) handled by clients to something other
than the requested URL.  This would allow, for example, the
requestor's URL to be used to encode information relating to a query,
but would then result in a single cache entry in the client.

To explain this a little more, if there were two GET requests, one for
/cgi-bin/food/hamburgers and one for /cgi-bin/food/french-fries, which
would result in a single page that ought to be cached as one page,
then the server ought to be able to say, "you asked for
/food/french-fries, but the page is called /food/generic-junk-food",
and to have the browser use that info to uniquely identify a cache
entry and update it with the newly fetched data.  This might not help
to avoid fetching documents extra times, but it would help on cache
coherence if the intent was to display a dynamically generated document.

Anyway, just some thoughts.  If you have any ideas, pointers or references
for me, I would really appreciate it.

Automatic reloading of a page in my history stack seems rather
user-unfriendly. I expect history loading to be fast and not go off over
the net. I guess I could see it as a user-specified option, but...

everyone else's.

Well, the most common format, audio/basic, has header information which
contains magic numbers and the Hz and stuff like that, and technically is
not a legal audio/basic file without them, though many players will tolerate
this.  I would put this in the same category as HTML; arbitrary segments
probably are not legal, but viewers might be able to tolerate them.

Indeed; you show a potentially useful, if rather brittle, example.
However, if the fragment is not a valid file type, how then should the
server label it?

That actually brings up an issue I've been meaning to mention somewhere
(the robots list would be appropriate, but I don't have time to join a
mailing list in order to post one issue).

We use a technology we call Dynamic View(tm) to present large amounts of
information in managable chunks, without creating a large hierarchy.  For
instance a mailing list might be broken into chunks by months, where you
would only see the details for the current month, and the rest would expand
when you click on the month name (see
http://www.utopia.com/mailings/edupage/ for an example).

This is great for people, however when a robot indexer comes to call I
don't want to confuse things. At best the structure will slow down the
indexing process. At worst it will look at a URL like
        http://www.utopia.com/mailings/edupage/?NAME=3DApril+95#April 95
and decide not to follow it at all.

So what to do? If we recognize the user-agent as a known robot, we give it
a flat presentation of the structure.  The catch of course, is that there
is no standard way to recognize a robot.  Some convention in the UserAgent
field would be sufficient, but....

Has anyone considered a move in that direction?  (Note, this also has a
bearing on URL-based shopping carts - I'd like the robot to be able to
browse the store without acquiring an ID, since you don't want the ID to
end up in some index somewhere. There of course, the problem is due to a
hack, so finding a solution is less critical if you're in a purist camp
:-).

I have two points I would like to see some bilateral info on:

Firstly, for my own research, I am wondering if anyone knows what the share
of the platform market is for web software, ie. does anyone know whether there
are more UNIX machines running webs than PC's etc.

Secondly, I am experiencing a lot of hostile censorship and power battles at
my local site, where one autonomous section of the University seeks to hold
all other web servers on the site in thrall, standardising everything and
putting in place .
I quote
'A user hostile front end'.
then they are going to firewall the whole thing.

I may be wrong but I get the impression that this would make us somewhat
unique in the internet world, as the one institution refusing to talk to
anyone on equal terms, in fact, more or less refusing to talk to anyone.
I was wondering if there are opinions on this, or if similar situations
occur elsewhere. To me it seems to be at extreme odds with the philosophy of
the web and I (and others) are quite upset that this kind of Draconian attitude
persists in an advancing world of open communication.

Comments?

Yours in his politically sound bunker

This is a naming solution, but it don't resolves the mutiple language problem
(perhaps I'am wrong ?)

If you have docA in french and english, docB only in french and
docC in french and english. From docA, you get docB and then docC.
Which is the language of the received docC ?

I have made a little change in the NCSA httpd server to help us.
When you choice a language (with href=URL?language=xx, where xx is
the ISO 639 code of the language), your client is registered on
the server (his IP address) with the choiced language. when you get 
a document, the server should give you the document in the right language
(the choice or the default if it doesn't exists).
example:
	http://www.ac.ucl.ac.be/LLN/vie.html?language=en
- - you go to UCL (in the bottom) <exists only in french>
- - then go to "La recherche"	-> you have the english version !!

The both versions have the same URL !
if the URL is http://myhost/path/file.html
the english file is /htpath/path/file-en.html
the french file is /htpath/path/file-fr.html

You can add a new language version without changing any anchor !!

But the best way in not to register the language of the client on the server ;
The client should be do a GET URL?language=fr,nl,en, and if the server
supports multi-language, it should give the fr version, if not, the nl
version, if not, the en version, if not the default version. But
this needs to change the client side ...

Subject: Proxy server interaction with password protected URLs?

I've been setting up URL's that refer to FTP accounts which require a
password, the URL's are of the form (for example) :

ftp://user@ftp.race.analysys.co.uk/user_dir/

This allows us to build a nice interface to files which require a simple
password to retrieve them.  On selecting this URL, the client prompt's the
user for their password, and then lets them into the FTP server.

This works well, but some users never get prompted for the password.  This
appears to be the case when they are accessing our site through a proxy
server.  In this case, they just get the reply :

Can't Access Document: ftp://user@ftp.race.analysys.co.uk/user_dir/
Reason: FTP-server replies: User user cannot log in.

I know very little about proxy servers, but this worries me.
Will they block this kind of request by default, or is it a configuration
issue at the proxy server end?
Is this a general issue with accesses that require user-id and passwords, or
is it only an issue for this type of FTP url?

Jim Warwick @ Analysys

PS: We're running the EMWAC HTTP server on a NT 3.5 platform and also using
the shipped MS FTP server on the same machine.

Huh?  Audio/basic is what ISDN uses.  It has no headers at all.

>From RFC1521:
   The content of the "audio/basic" subtype is audio encoded using 8-bit
   ISDN mu-law [PCM].  When this subtype is present, a sample rate of
   8000 Hz and a single channel is assumed.

If this doesn't mean the format is "raw", please let me know where the 
headers are defined.  --Darren

Technically you are correct. However there are a large number of viewers
out there (on all platforms) which are used for audio/basic, but which
choke if handed anything that doesn't have a Sun AU header on it.

I have some questions regarding specification of HTTP/1.0, dated March 8, 
1995.  Does anybody help me for more clarafications?

1)  LINK in request message:
One link end-point is defined by Request-URI, and where is the other 
end-point defined?

2)  Content-Language:
When not specified, the default is that intended for all language 
audience.  Do you mean enlish (en)?

For an entity that has more than 1 Content-Language, says 2, how is the
data sent?  In 2 set of entitties, each of which in each language, but 
representing to the same data?

Thanks in advance

I definitely see your point -- as I see it we're talking about a
"lesser of evils" situation.  When you "back up" to an expired page,
there are only three things I can think of that could happen:
1. you see the expired document.
2. you see an error message and (if you interpret the message correctly)
	you can reload the page manually
3. the browser reloads the page behind your back.

Well, as Lori Anderson would put it, "?Que es mas macho?"
I guess I'd pick door number 1 -- but only for the case where you view
the page with browser navigation commands, not explicit links.

I don't know what library you are using, but all you should have to do is

<input type=3Dhidden name=3Dfoo value=3Dbar>

and then $FORM{'foo'} (assuming someone has parsed the input and built %FORM

That is a different issue and definitely best left to HTTP NG.  The original
issue was how to guarantee the client that they have received the full
entity-body, specifically how to do this for dynamic objects.  I suggested
that one way to handle this was to put the entity-body on disk and then use
content-length.  If you don't want to do that, I believe there are two
primary proposals: unique boundaries and packet encoding.  I don't think
packet encoding was ever discussed in the context of multiplexing a
connection, as you discuss.

   I agree, I recently said the same thing in another thread (Client
   handling of Expires:) on www-talk.  There, I said that

   |In my opinion, for this problem to be really solved, a client should
   |maintain two stores:
   |
   | a) a resource content cache that handles Expires, for reducing network
   |    traffic when a link is clicked for a second time
   | b) a `contents that were previously displayed' store, for use by the
   |    history function and `back/forward' buttons.
   |
   |Of course, stores a) and b) can share memory for most information.
   |Typically, store b) will only be able to hold information for the
   |recent history.

   It would be wrong to call store b) a (special kind of) cache.  Calling
   it a `history log' would be more appropriate.

Good decomposition of the problem. I'll go along with this.

   Yes.  The main requirement for `history browsing' is that it is fast,
   not that it provides up to date results.

   One HTTP-spec related issue here is that the current draft HTTP spec
   encourages writers of forms whose response messages can change through
   time, e.g. a search form on a dynamic database, to set the expires:
   field to a date in the past.  From section 7.1.8 of the draft:

   #   If a resource is dynamic by nature, 
   #   as is the case with many data-producing processes, copies of that 
   #   resource should be given an appropriate Expires value which 
   #   reflects that dynamism.

   Thus, if a properly programmed (expires header generating) dynamic
   search form is accessed with a browser that *does* automatically
   reload expired responses in the history, browsing a 20-link search
   result will be both slow and resource-intensive.

And with the "other kind" of browser, the current behavior is to 
display error messages as the user revisits expired pages in the history
stack.  I think we now agree (you and I anyway) that both behaviors are
wrong.

   The browser author has almost no choice but to make the history
   function ignore the expires: field.

And the CGI script writer has almost no choice but NOT TO USE expires:
if such "Data Missing" error messages would confuse users.

   One could argue that the HTTP spec is broken because of this; a
   history function that would ignore expires only for search scripts and
   the like, not for normal dynamic information, would be preferable.
   But currently, there is no safe way of telling the difference between
   `search' and `non-search'.

   Well, 3. usually involves animating icons and flashing http transaction
   progress messages, so 3. will never be completely `behind your back'
   if you pay attention to the screen.

   >Well, as Lori Anderson would put it, "?Que es mas macho?"
   >I guess I'd pick door number 1 -- but only for the case where you view
   >the page with browser navigation commands, not explicit links.

   I agree 1. is best, but of course only for `history browsing'.  There
   us a subtle point here, however: as the `history log' store b) I
   talked about earlier cannot be infinite, the browser is sometimes
   forced to do 3. to satisfy a history browsing effect (2. is not really
   an option IMO).

   The point is that the user never knows beforehand if 1. or 3. will be
   done for an older item in the history list, and this is bad if the
   item was the result of a non-idempotent POST operation (i.e. a form
   submission that `did' something, like order a pizza).  If 3. is done
   on such an item, this means reposting the form; and this means (unless
   the form author is paranoid, and luckily many are) inadvertently
   ordering a second pizza.  Thus, not having enough RAM in your computer
   will be bad for your health :)

There's a solution to this: if the browser needs to flush something
from its cache (which contains the union of pages from the "resource
cache" and "history log"), it should first try flushing pages from the
resource cache.  If there are none left to flush, (i.e. if the history
log has become dominant), then the history log should be flushed
"oldest first" (or possibly LRU), and the user should not be allowed
to revisit that page, or only to be allowed to visit it with a warning
and then an explicit reload.  I.e. this is the same as the behavior
I'm complaining about above, but with the big difference that it is
under proper cache control logic, and so would apply only to the
least-likely-to-be-visited pages in the history log.  I would not even
object to having all record of the oldest pages simply removed from
the history.

   This is an important problem that, in my opinion, can only be solved
   by putting extra stuff in the HTTP-spec.  A paranoid form author can
   provide a 70% solution to this problem within the current HTTP-spec,
   but nothing beyond that.

   For a further discussion of this problem, see my article `HTTP and
   statefull services' in the www-talk archive.

   Shel Kaphan writes:
   >I realize these considerations may have no role in the HTTP spec,

   The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that these
   considerations _do_ have a role in the HTTP spec:

   1) parts of the solution to these problems involve HTTP extensions.

   2) Also, as long as we only have the HTTP spec and the HTML spec to
   specify the behavior of browsers, the HTTP spec is the most likely
   place to solve this problem, even though the issue goes beyond data
   transfer.

   I've been meaning to submit some report/proposal to the http-wg
   mailing list about this, but I have not yet had the time to write one.
   If anyone wants to help putting together such a report, please mail
   me.

Count me in.

   >however I feel there are serious problems in this area, which can only

   I agree there are serious problems.  Besides browser and server
   authors, CGI script authors is also involved.

   I feel www-talk would be a good place to discuss these problems and
   possible solutions.  I have tried to get a discussion going a number
   of times, but so far, little has happened :(

Well, I think we have the basis for a pretty concrete proposal above,
and would be happy to work with you to put it in the right form and
before a forum that can act on it.

   I don't think this would help with cache coherence at all, for proper
   definitions of `coherence'.  There is no reason for the `cache for
   real browsing commands' ever to become incoherent (contain expired
   page contents).  It seems to me you are proposing to automatically
   update old versions of a page in the `history log'.  If new contents
   for that URL are received, `history browsing' back would then display
   the new, changed price of hamburgers I assume.

Hmmm -- I think perhaps I didn't explain this very clearly.
Now, I think all this is unneeded if you have 'expires' working
properly, nonetheless I should explain what I meant:

Let's consider another example, this time a more realistic one.
Actually this occurred to me because of another browser, uh, mis-feature.
This is the way Lynx (and possibly other browsers) improperly displays hidden
fields on forms.  My workaround for that was to put what I would have
put in hidden fields into the URL -- i.e. encode the same information
that would have been in a hidden field into PATH_INFO instead. 

So suppose you have two ways of viewing a certain page.  One way
involves a form submission which changes the state somewhere in
CGI-land, and would display a new "shopping basket" for the user.
The purpose of the form was add something to the shopping basket and
then display the contents.  So the URL might contain something like
/cgi-bin/shopping-basket/product-code=WHOPPER+FRIES+SHAKE. 
The product code is in the URL because of the hidden field bug.

Later on, the user wants simply to view the shopping basket, so they
click on a link to /cgi-bin/shopping-basket.

In the current world, the two pages would be cached separately, so if
the buggy browser ignores the expires field (and you should probably
ignore this discussion if that can be made to work...)  then even after you
change the state of the shopping basket by submitting the form,
following the link to /cgi-bin/shopping-basket might well show obsolete
data, *even if it's really the same page*.  The problem is that the
caching is not based on the identity of the displayed page, but on the
identity of the requesting URL.  So I am suggesting some additional
header field which, if present (and it's of course optional!) should be
used as the document identifier in the client's cache, instead of the
requestor's URL.


   While such a scheme would be great for some applications, it should
   not be the default, or it should at least be possible for _the service
   author_ to switch off.  I can imagine plenty of cases where the user
   wants to see _the old_ version of the page (e.g. the chess board 3
   moves ago, the gold price 10 minutes ago), if at all possible.


   Koen.

It would not only be switch-off-able, but you wouldn't get this
behavior at all unless you put in the extra, optional, header field.

I won't be sorry, no, because I'll remember that if even one-half percent
of those customers chose that web solution _instead_ of a real IP-level
solution (and an automatic 256-address block allocation), they net effect
is an IP-address saving.

Regarding your WWW-specific RR, I don't think it's such a good idea.  It's
a convenient band-aid for a specific problem and doesn't help the next guy
very much. Since it uses ASCII strings it may even be hurtful due to
increased reply size.  DNS, IMHO, cannot be extended with one new RR per
new service on the net, and even starting on that path (MX) was a mistake.

I'm confused. Are you advocating a central registry of all browser owners,
where the browser checks that registry, asks me to match the password, and
then lets me send mail?  I think a public key system would be simpler,
safer and more private.

I'm trying to get a feel for the current state of play regarding remote 
publishing via the Web.  I would appreciate if anyone can fill in any 
gaps.  So far I've got the following:

 - PUT and POST have been in HTTP/1.0 for a long time although largely 
   unnused.  (The latest Internet draft (12-May-95) [1] however refers 
   to "current implementations of the POST and PUT methods" (7.2) - where 
   are they?).

 - The current implementations I am aware of are the "intelligent 
   publishing environment" from Georgia Inst. of Technology [2] and 
   the Symposia editor/browser [3] from Grif and INRIA.

 - a method for file upload does not yet seem to be agreed upon although 
   there is a draft proposal [5] from Nebel, Masinter at Xerox.
   (Several questions over the past few months on www-talk on this).

 - the CERN server supports PUT/POST via external scripts (this is used 
   by Symposia).  Symposia documentation implies that more complete 
   support in the CERN/W3O server is on its way [4].

And some questions:

 - are there any browsers supporting file upload and PUT (aside from 
   Symposia)?

 - are there any servers with generic PUT and POST support other than 
   CERN httpd?

 - when can we hope to see broad support from clients/servers?

 - is forms-based file upload a prerequesite for remote publishing using 
   current Web browsers?

Thanks in advance,

Steve

Hooray for small miracles.

	...

   If it's really the same page, then there's nothing much "Universal" about 
   your "Universal Resource Locator," is there?   :-)

It depends what you mean "Universal"  I always interpreted that to
mean that since the protocol is part of the identifier, it is
universal in the sense that it tells you everything you need to do to
get the resource.  In that sense there's nothing about my suggestion
that is "non-universal".  Your suggested meaning of "Univeral" implies you

   Should be the same.  That's why they're called "Universal".

   Ick!  Let's hide more information from the user so it's *completely* 
   impossible to figure out what's going wrong. Good idea.

Well, I hate to disappoint you, but there's already an optional "uri:"
header field  defined in the spec.  My suggestion boils down to how browsers
should use the information in this field, I think, in addition to the
URL by which they requested the document.  (The intended use
of this header field isn't too clearly spelled out in the HTTP2 spec.)

   What if they really do want to go back to an empty shopping basket?
    --Darren

Well, then presumably they want it to really BE empty, which means the
server (which may be keeping persistent state on the user's behalf)
and the browser need to agree.  Having the user just be able to view
obsolete data won't help with anything.

There shouldn't be any context issues.  For each request, the "optimal"  page
is delivered.  The algorithm that determines "optimal" is left open to the
document author/server developer - the HTTP spec simply says that in the
Accept-Language: request fields list languages in the order of preference. 
Furthermore, the spec says "If the server cannot fulfill the request with one
or more of the languages given, or if the languages only represent a subset
of a multi-linguistic Entity-Body, it is acceptable to serve the request 
in an unspecified language", though I suppose you could also send an 
error code 406, "None Acceptible" and offer links to the versions you 
support.  

So, your pages should work like this: http://host/path/docA has 
pointers to /path/docB and /path/docC, where you don't give *any* 
filename extensions, and the server can determine based on the request 
headers whether a request for docB means docB.en or docB.it.  

I posted a week ago here that we needed a mechanism in URL's to express 
request headers, so that some sort of addressing can be used to obtain 
specific representations of objects (i.e., *exactly* the Italian version 
without requiring that the Italian version have its own URL).  I didn't 
get any response, but I also hear that the mail list redistributor blew 
up last week - did anyone respond to that?

> I have made a little change in the NCSA httpd server to help us.

So have we - Apache supports content negotiation not just on Accept:
but on also on Accept-Language: headers.  Now we just need smarter and 
more configurable clients.

I would not mind to get a small warning icon or something if I display
an expired page from the history list, but an all-out error message
would be wrong.

I disagree here; the spec encourages the script writer to use expires,
and implicitly _dis_courages client authors to implement `data missing'
error messages.

In my interpretation of the http spec, the expires header is just a
hint for caching, not a promise that the information returned will
become way too invalid to be shown after the time indicated.

Thus, in my interpretation, the http spec does _not_ require to client
to display any `Data missing' error message if it is about to show an
expired response, especially if the response has just been received
from a server.

It could be argued that there needs to be a second header, e.g.

Do-not-show-contents-after

to allow the authors of, say, pages titled `current gold price,
updated every 10 minutes' to provide hints to browsers about
displaying `warning: this history list entry is out of date' messages.

Yes, this seems to be the only safe solution that does not require
changes to the http protocol.  I think this restriction should apply
at least to pages made by POST requests, and possibly also to normal
expired pages (fetched by GET requests).

Of course, it remains a sub-optimal solution; one could do much better
with small extensions to http, e.g. a `OK to resubmit silently flag'
or some other header value that implies this.

Well, any mechanism that shortens a history list makes it less
useful.  I guess most users would prefer a long history list that is
either unsafe or that wants confirmation messages now and then.

That would indeed be one way of getting closer to a safe shopping
basket solution.  Encoding session state in document contents (links
mentioned in documents) is inherently unsafe with the current http
spec, as the service author cannot prevent the user from (using a
client that allows) backing up through the history list and clicking
on an old link.

My old www-talk article `HTTP and statefull services (was: Shopping
baskets)' also covers the shopping basket problem, and proposes a
different kind of solution.  The proposed fix to the state-keeping
problem was a client-identification field that allows servers to store
the state locally.

I think we both agree that (small) http extensions are needed to make
statefull applications really safe.  Many possible extensions could do
the trick, these seems to be no consensus about which extensions are
best, or most general.  If anyone involved with secure http is reading
this: does secure http have stuff to solve such problems?

Perhaps there is more.
What about an 'realistic' platform independant interface.
Reality (for the moment) is:

OS/2    - OpenDoc
MacOS   - OpenDoc
Windows - OLE 2.0
UNIX    - i don't remember a name, but there also a OpenDoc-like interface
..

A few issues for such a modular Browser:

- (Inter)action on client side
- Style sheets
- Layout control
- Proxy-control (resolving host-moving-problems)
- Downloading (and auto-installing) of small patches
..

Um... no, not really. PUT is largely unused, but POST is used almost

The external script support in these servers (which, btw also applies to 
the GET and DELETE queries) is an optional feature that doesn't have much 
use. However, the CERN httpd and the other major ones (like NCSA) let you 
use any method you like for CGI scripts, and most of those are 
POST-based.

No browser I'm aware of supports either file upload or PUT.

generic? the CERN httpd doesn't really have generic support... it has 
hooks for such support, but...

Never. :-) It really isn't all that neccessary. Especially with the 
forms-based file-upload draft, that makes for a much nicer interface than 
a generic PUT-compatible client.

No current web browser supports forms-based file upload that I'm aware of, so...

Hi,

I'm writing a little program under MS-Windows and I want to send a
POST-request to my own WWW-server which should start a CGI-script and send a
binary file to the WWW-server.

At the moment I have no idea how to achieve this. I would be very pleased
with a simple example program or something alike.

I looked already for the libwww but as far as I could see, this library is
not ported to MS-Windows.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Hi,
(Sorry if I'm in the wrong list, is there a server-only list?)

I'm having a problem with environnment variables.
I run NCSA's server (1.4.1) under SunOs4.1.3
When executing a test script (In a protected directory) 
that display the REMOTE_USER variable,
if It is launched through an hypertext link, it works fine,
but if it is launched through the SUBMIT button of a form,
the REMOTE_USER does not exist anymore.

Anyone knows about that ?
Thanks in advance.

Only centralised in a local sense :-)

e.g. students in a public access lab being required to supply a valid 
user name and password to a local "authentication server" before the 
browser will allow them to send mail or post news.  The authenticated 
user name would be stamped on any messages they sent, say as an X- 
header

At the moment it's ridiculously easy for casual WWW users to forge 
messages.  This is just a quick hack which would make it a bit more 
difficult.  Perhaps too difficult for the majority.  Sure, public key 
would be nice too, but more effort is involved!

Sorry to discuss something different.

Adobe's Acrobat Reader software requires a Distiller prog and Exchange 
Prog to convert a ps file to pdf file and to create your own pdf file. 
Does one have to get it separately coz i'm sure it doesn't come along the 
reader.

1) from a document:
	ex: The anchor to the Italian version of the document (even the
	Accept-Language of the client is english, give the italian version !
	<a href=URL ???>Italian version</a>)

	Possibility: An option in the <a href=URL Accept-Language=it>...</a>
	anchor who bypass the Accept-Language request ???
2) from the client:
	- change the accept-language preferrence
	- or get the document with to above 1) option (who don't exists !)

On the mail side I believe there is a POP3 extension which allows sending
mail. Since POP requires a password that might meet your needs. However I
suspect you'll have trouble convincing browser authors to support a feature
that has a rather restricted domain like that.

I was thinking more in terms of the browser inserting a magic cookie 
in outgoing (SMTP and/or NNTP) messages, rather than using a 
different protocol to send the messages

e.g.

  X-Sender: nazgul@utopia.com (verified)
  X-Mailer: ACME WebGobbler

So the aim is really to discourage the casual user from mucking 
about, since their real identity will be stamped on the messages they 
send

And the code to implement this using the authentication elements of 
(say) POP, IMAP or FTP would be quite, quite, trivial

Hi. Let me respond to your points one by one.

In my mind the expires field should ONLY be used for documents with a
fixed lifetime. Cool-site-of-the-day for example, or dynamic pages
which expire immediately. I agree that browsers should do a better job
with pages that expire immediatly; namely showing them but not caching
them. I believe that for all other items (with undetermined lifetimes)
thath the browsers should use the technique that I describe in the
chapter of my thesis labeled "Cache consistency" that is based on the
Alex FTP cache. Namely, the older a page is the less likely that the
page will change. when the browser suspects that the page might have
changed it sends the "get-if-changed-since" message to the server to
find out whether its cached replica needs to be updated. If the answer
is "yes" then it updates the page before showing it to the
user. Otherwise it simply uses the page currently cached.

the Browser decides when to check by using ratio of the time since the
file was last checked to the age of the file (time since file was
created). Whenever this ratio exceeds some threshold, ie 10%, the file
is checked. In other words, if the file is a month old, and it was
last checked an hour ago, don't bother checking again before using the
cached copy. If the file was created a month ago, and last checked a
week ago, then contact the server before showing the user the cached
file. I describe simulations in my thesis that show this to be a
promising approach.


    Shel> So, I have a question and I have suggestions.

    Shel> First, the question:

You're right, my stuff does not address the "here and now" very
well. I'm describing a solution to caching on local-area-networks, not
necessarily clients and their history stacks.

I agree here. There is already a redirection mechanism in place, but
I don't think the results of the redirection are cached across
sessions. I would love it if the user could ask for page a on machine
b, and be told that page a now lives on machine c, and remember that
fact until told otherwise. after all, a redirection like this only
takes 30 or 40 bytes, and the typical client could store thousands of
them very neatly.

I have a question for the various browser authors out there.

I'm currently implementing some of my web replication research, but
I'm not sure how browsers currently handle redirections. If a browser
requests a URL, and my server returns a redirection to another
machine, do most browsers cache this information? If the links on that
new page are relative do most browsers append the new, redirected
machine to form a URL? Or do most browsers continue to append the old
machine to the local file to form the URL? Are these redirections
commonly cached across sessions (only applicable for browsers that
cache information across sessions, clearly).

Let me present a scenario to make my questions clear.

User A connects to Server X to request the following URL -
http://X/file1

File 1 has been replicated on Server Y, and Server Y is closer to User
A. Therefore server X returns a redirect message - http://Y/file1

User A now retrieves that file from Server Y. In that document was a
reference to a local file, of the form <a href="file2">link</a> When
the user tries to retrieve this file, what will the browser do?
Presumably it will try to retrieve http://Y/file2 right? what if only
file1 has been replicated on server Y? I assume this will fail, since
I presume the browser will not attempt to retrieve
http://X/file2. Does this imply that I should stay away from local
references? That when server X replicates the file onto server Y that
it should replace all local references with the appropriate absolute
URL's?

You  need to be careful there. Redirection is often used to do some
processing at point A and the continue on to point B.  You don't want to
cache *that* result.  It's not always as the result of a form submission
either.  In fact we do this when people point a Lycos, Yahoo, Infoseek or
OpenText search at one of our mailing lists. We check the Referer field,
figure out what you were searching for in the particular file you are
hitting, and then redirect you to the same document, but this time with
parameters (including a #xxx) which will take you to the right point in the
document.  Caching that would make it impossible for the user to ever go
directly to the top of the document.

Now if you want to argue that Redirect is for moved documents, and there
should be a "NowGoHere" directive, I might be persuaded.  But...

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

Does anyone know a site where placed on TeX document browser(for Mac web

Hi,

I have accidentally deleted the original Session-ID post and accompanying
replies & comments. I am about to implement a server & client using a 
Session-ID mechanism (akin to the original post) and would like to re-read
these messages.

If anyone still has them, I would really appreciate a copy. I will announce
my implementation to the list when it is ready (it will be built on Apache &
Mosaic).

Cheers, Chris

The draft http spec already defines both a Redirect and a NowGoHere.
The redirection code

  301 Moved Permanently

signifies permanent redirection; clients are encouraged to remember
the it, and the code

  302 Moved Temporarily

signifies a redirection that may be dynamic.  The draft spec implies
that redirection information gotten in a 302 response may never be
cached, though I wonder how many clients conform to this part.

I've been writing on a draft spec commentary which suggests that the
expires header may be used to allow control cacheability of 302 (and
300) responses.

Koen.

The basic rule of which return codes to cache is that there should be
a clear advantage of doing so in saved network access. In this light,
even though most of the return codes infact can be cached, in most
cases, it doesn't make a lot of sense. Examples of this are "404 Not
Found", and "500 Internal" where basically only the connection is saved
(which then again might be a significant win)

Regarding "301 Permanently Moved" code then the best solution
is to actually modify the link in the document. Caching
the document doesn't make a lot of sense, but the information in the
Location/URI-header header sure does!

Expires headers on 302 codes sounds like a good idea - not on 300!

I think we need a return code that is somewhere in between these two
codes. Let me reiterate my application and you can see what I mean. I
envision a system where pages are replicated across many
servers. Clients should be redirected to the nearest server containing
a replica of the pages that client is interested in. Under this scheme
the client does not know ahead of time where the replicas are; the
server however does. The redirection should be cached across sessions,
but the document link should not be changed necessarily, since the
redirection will vary depending on the location of the client. A
client in Australia for example will most likely be redirected to a
server in Australia, but you don't want to change the link in the
document to point to the Australia replica.

This is not quite the same as a "permanent" change; more like a
"suggested redirection". In such a case there must also be a way of
forcing the server to provide the document -- otherwise in certain
situations you can enter a race condition of endless redirection.

The justification for this scheme can be found at
http://www.das.harvard.edu/research/vino/push.cache/

James.

>Expires headers on 302 codes sounds like a good idea - not on 300!

Here's a patch for the CERN server which does just that. See
<http://www.nads.de/NADS/Ueberblick/heute> for an example what it
is good for. Said URI redirects the requestor to the event diary of
*today* of Dsseldorf and about. An Expires header is appended to
the redirect response which makes it expire at midnight Dsseldorf
time.

This patch also enables the proxy to cache URI with parameters, i. 
e. with a '?' in it. However, this is not well tested and probably
buggy. But so far it didn't do any harm. The patch also makes
cgiutils to distinguish between its options -expires and -extra.

(Hey, what did Ari pin down when he wrote cgiutils? "Written in a
terrible hurry just before going to Italy..." Consequence: Never
write programs when being in a hurry. Contradiction: Following that
rule no programs would ever be written. :-)

Isn't that what URNs address? You can (will be able to) do caching
based on URNs rather than URLs.

I believe the point was that this doesn't necessarily force a reload. When
you are doing an order form with a list of things that you have ordered so
far, it's important to make sure that the document that is displayed is
fresh, not from the cache.  As far as I know there are only two ways to
guarantee the what you want.

1) Have the order script be the thing that spits out the form.
In other words.
        /cgi-bin/takeorder
spits out an empty order form when invoked with no arguments, and it's
forms just resubmit to itself.

2) Have an order form and an order script.  The order form should set the
Expires header and Pragma: no-cache (works for Netscape). However, even
that won't work with some caching servers, so you need to go one more step.
When the "takeorder" script redirects back to the order form, have it pass
a unique argument everytime (e.g.
http://www.somewhere.com/order.html?Defeat-Cache=3Dxxx, where xxx is the
result of "time(0)" or something).  The html file will ignore the argument,
but the presence of the argument will defeat any caching mechanism.

Anyone have a third option?

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

Erm, it should do.  Proxy caches shouldn't be caching any returns from 
CGI scripts as these are likely to be dynamic documents (ie they can 
change between invocations).  If the CGI script is called and then 
returns some arbitrary HTML document, that document is the one that the 
browser should display.

And it can also spit out the empty form (or whatever it was you wanted to 
reload) once the form has been processed.  That was what was originally 
asked for I thought.

Maybe there are some really broken caches that cache the output of CGI 
scripts that I wasn't aware of though...

If you used the cache-buster in the URL then you could definitely have
problems like that.  However I was only recommending using it in the
redirect, where the user does not have direct access to the link (save in
browser's like Pipeline, which don't recognize redirects and display the
HTML instead (have they fixed that?))

You're right about the Expires. However in my tests using AOL's browser,
their caching server wasn't respecting it either, so until then we're stuck
with hacks.  I still think though, that it is worthwhile separating out
"don't keep in history list" from "this document has expired".

Again: there is *no* *way* a proxy server, or a client cache, can tell 
if a GET request is made to a CGI script or a regular file.  Period.  The 
only thing proxy caches really have are Last-Modified and Expires: 
headers, and optionally Pragma: no-cache.  If none of those headers are 
present in the response, then the cache can presume that it can't cache 
the data.  However, POST requests should indeed never be cached, since 
by definition (though not always by practice) they modify some data on 
the web server and are thus not idempotent.  

> Maybe there are some really broken caches that cache the output of CGI

The more common proxy caches are, er, erroneous in many places, but this 
isn't one of them.

That clears it up and I now have some understanding of the shopping-basket

Also, any gif images that are sourced from the output of the CGI script are
cached.  So if you have updated the sourced image, there is no way to force the
browser to re-read the image from the server instead of from the cache.

That is the case. I confess that I don't know how I discovered it, but it
definitely turns off history caching in Netscape. Set it on a form, for
instance, and you don't have to worry about the user resubmitting it - if
they go back to it, it's been reloaded.

I have to confess I was experimenting with Expires as the same time, so I
clearly fouled up the testing somewhere.

What do you mean by "special reloads"?

[NB: I seem to have really stirred up a hornets nest here - I don't think 
I've ever had so many replies to posting to _any_ mailing list!  So I'm 
going to reply to the list in one go rather than reply separately to lots 
of people.]

My comments about just letting the CGI script return the document that 
the browser should reload has pulled up a few interesting points:

1) Some people seemed to think I was implying sending a redirect from the
CGI script (or that's what they would have done).  I didn't mean that at
all - I intended the script to return the document to be reloaded not
redirect the browser.  An HTTP Redirect response from the script could
easily result in the browser retrieving a cached copy of the document. 
Some people have pointed out that the CGI script might not know where the
document to be loaded is located which is possible but unlikely, mainly
because it would have to know where it is to issue the HTTP redirect. 

2) Clients and caches can handle Expires: and Pragma: nocache headers
badly.  True.  However, I use X Mosaic and a Harvest object cache all the
time (and a CERN caching proxy before that) and I can't say that I really
notice too many problems associated with this (plenty of other problems to
do with the caches though! :-) ).  The biggest problem appears to be when
someone has a non-CGI document that includes dynamic information into an
otherwise static HTML document (counters, etc) and the remote server
doesn't send any useful headers to the cache.  This has resulted in me
hacking my copy of Mosaic to have some ``Really Reload'' and ``Open
Direct'' options tucked away in it.  IMHO things sitting in cgi-bin's pretty
much always seem to work ok though.  YMMV. 

3) If the CGI script is invoked as a result of the POST method in a FORM, 
the output shouldn't be cached anyway.  So maybe the moral of the story 
is always use POST insituations like this... :-)

Lastly, the reason I made the comment was basically that's what I do with 
lots of the CGI scripts I write (the good old IETF way of basing 
things on implementation experience :-) ).  Its interesting that so many 
people feel that they would have problems with these forms.  It makes me 
wonder how many of my users have had these problems and just not told me 
about them... :-|

Question: last I looked, the body returned by a POST request was defined
to be ignored; only the header elements told you what the new URL is.  The
previous version of Lynx ignored it, also, but the newest version treats
it as the page to display. 

Is there an actual and up-to-date description of HTTP as currently 
implemented? Or does one just get bitten and then go fix the problem 
after cleaning up after dozens of customers? Or did I just misread 
something in the spec?     --Darren

Hi folks,
maybe this has been answered before, but is there currently a method to force
a document reload, say after a form has been processed. I suppose there isnt
at the moment. I was wondering if anyone else would find it useful.

Options:

  o Have the CGI script which processes the form return an HTML
    document

  o Use one of the browser APIs which are now available to force the
    browser to reload (CCI should be able to do this soon, I think the
    Netscape one can do it now.)
    See <http://yahoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/mosaic/cci.spec>
        <http://home.netscape.com/info/APIs/>

  o NCC added some (IMHO atrocious) hacks to the last version of
    Netscape to allow "dynamic documents" which allows you to reload
    documents periodically.
    See <http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html>

I wonder if we should move away from the expires vs. cache issue and just
explicitly disabling the cache. Netscape does this already with a pragma
directive - with dynamic documents (say an order form where you don't want
the history to point at an old version) I use both that expires and the
nocache directive just to be sure.

Just have the CGI script that processes the FORM return the required 
document?

Not true. I can determine the URL of the document either by passing it from
the form to the script, or because I know what it's going to be ahead of
time. The physical location of the document however is not possible to
assertain portably from one site from another. As far as I can tell, even
DOCUMENT_ROOT doesn't work if you are using aliases to point out of the
source tree. The root directory of my particular web site is the one thing
I have to hard code in a script config file as I move a site from a staging
area to the final location.  Maybe the cern server has a working solution
to this, but I can't find one under NCSA 1.3 or Apache.

There are problems with this approach.  If you have a page A that
contains a link in the form you suggest to document B, and you have already
viewed page A and followed the link to B, if you "back up" to A with
browser navigation commands, and then follow B again, you may still
get the *old* document B (because the browser might cache B).  This is
precisely where where browsers should respect "expires:", and where
some current ones do not.  Moreover, if browsers did respect the
expires header, the "cache-buster" in the URL would not be needed.

I highly recommend _Internet World_ by Mecklermedia[1]. I have found
each issue that I got my hands on sufficiently interesting that I read
it cover to cover: features, columns, feedback letters, and even the
ads. And I'm talking about the hardcopy version, though having it on
the web is a bonus!

Lots of folks seem to like WIRED, but it doesn't hold my interest
the way IW does.

I saw a more "trade rag" style magazine called Interactive Age that
had lots of relavent stuff. And Communications of the ACM is pretty
good (though not always relavent to the internet).

Oh! And don't forget Ora.com[2] (and GNN and the upcoming "Web Review")
-- anything by the O'Reilly gang is something to keep an eye on.

Please note the word "likely" - you wrote it yourself. The fact
that something results from a CGI script doesn't qualify for
immediate expiry. A proxy cache should always pay attention to the
Expires header, even if the URL contains a '?' and a search string.
There are CGI results lasting for years (at least).

Hi folks.
This is announce for wcol's beta05 and call for tester.



		Wcol: WWW Collector --- prefetching proxy server.

Wcol is prefetching HTTP proxy server. 
Prefetch, get data before user's request is possible to reduce
response time. Wcol apply this technique to linked data in WWW.
So, Your clients will make fast clients via wcol.


Wcol is located follows. 
    ftp://ftp.aist-nara.ac.jp/pub/misc/WWW/wcol/wcol.950601_143640.tar.gz

This version was tested in ULTRIX 4.3 and SunOS 4.1.4. But it work
also other platforms. Last version work on BSD/OS 1.1, SunOS 4.1.3,
IRIX 5.2, OSF/1 1.3 .


Documents (http://shika.aist-nara.ac.jp/products/wcol/wcol.html) is

Provide the GIF image with an appropriate Expires header

Sorry, it's just coincedence.  Netscape doesn't parse any Pragma:
headers.  It does honor expires though.  It will also do special
reloads if you send a document without a "Last-modified:" header.

How can proxy caches they tell the difference between a return from a
CGI script and another document?  Some returns from CGI scripts might
well be static documents, for which caching would be appropriate.  
"Dynamic" documents that should not be cached should be set to expire
immediately.  Unfortunately, as discussed elsewhere, current browsers 
do not all handle expires gracefully, so this whole area is currently
in a bit of a mess.

Returns from CGI scripts work fine (that was the first option I gave). The
problem is when the CGI script does a redirect to another document, and
that document is cached. Unfortunately, when you are writing generic order
forms, it's a lot easier to redirect to someone's order form than it is to
try and read it off of the local disk (who knows where in the file
structure) and print it out that way.

  You should stop that before its too late.

  A 'magic cookie' in most cases is some token that gets passed back and
forth between the client and the server.  Usually it will carry some sort
of state information with it (a shopping-basket type thing).

The presence of my suggested expires header in 302 responses would
serve to _enable_ cacheing, the draft http spec now implies that 302
responses should never be cached.

You mean to say that the Netscape _browser_ disables its internal
cacheing when receiving a pragma: no-cache in a form _response_??  That
would be strange but wonderful, as the draft http spec defines this
pragma to be an optional part of a client _request_ message.

In general, the expires header is a completely adequate mechanism for
disabling cacheing, _if only browsers would actually interpret it_.

In the last Lynx and Netscape versions I tested, the internal cache
just ignored expires, in effect there seemed to be no mechanism at all
to get anything dropped from the internal cache.

To deal with these broken caches when implementing a dynamic service,
I actually ended up generating one-time dynamic URLs for everything!
Ugh.

BTW, while the expires header is adequate for disabling cacheing, it
is not adequate for controlling history list contents, see the first
few messages in this thread.  If you, as a dynamic form author, want
to make the history list never point to an old version, you are out of
luck.

As a dynamic service author, I have often wanted to have the ability
to mess with the history lists of the users.  Having this abilitity, I
could improve the safety and navigation speed (no more backing up
through forms) of my service.

However,

1) I can't change history lists with current browsers
2) I can't think of any general yet safe command language for
   communicating history list manipulations to the browser
3) dynamic history lists have the potential of being very confusing
4) I don't think all users will appreciate me changing their history
   lists
5) I certainly would hate to have my history list `improved' by every
   bozo with a bright idea whose site I happen to browse
6) a mechanism for changing history lists opens a whole new realm of
   subtle security considerations.

Thanks.

Is MOMspider robot ?
It is interesting, but it is different from my approach.
Prefetchgin proxy server analyze response and get linked data.

They cannot tell the difference according to anything you can find in
the current draft http spec.  But there does exist a well-established,
though not well-known, convention.

The convention is that CGI script generated responses will never have
Last-modified headers in them.

Http servers attach Last-modified headers when sending normal document
contents, because they can easily get the last modified date by
looking at the file date.  Servers cannot (automatically) generate a
Last-modified to go with script output, so they don't.  Summarizing,
CGI scripts are not required by the spec to omit a last-modified
header, but in practice they all do.

Thus, the lack of Last-modified is a means of telling that a response
came from a script.

As far as I know, all popular proxy caches never cache responses that
lack both a Last-modified header and an Expires header.  Thus, no
popular proxy will cache CGI script output, unless of course the CGI
script author adds one of these headers by hand.

Again, proxy caches are not required by the spec to look at
last-modified, but in practice they all do, as anything else causes
problems.  Quoting an old (18 May 1995) message on the http-wg mailing
list:

Ari Luotonen:
|In the earliest stages the CERN server used to
|cache also CGI responses, but that was a mistake and I changed it so
|that only documents with either Expires: and/or Last-modified: header
|can be cached.  This is the way both CERN and Netscape proxies do it,
|and anything smarter will cause problems.  So, CGI scripts may
|explicitly allow caching by giving at least on of those headers,
|indicating a non-zero lifetime (L-M less than current time; Expires
|greater than current time).

As I said before, this convention is well-established, though not
well-known.  It seems to have come about a result of `evolution', not
as the result of an intentional specification effort.  I feel this
convention should be documented in the next draft http/1.0 spec
though, I will be putting out a proposal for this some time in the
near future.

Hi folks,

It would be nice to have a href-tag
<A HREF="Return to last entry in history">
(you could implement a BACK-Button inside the HTML-Widget)

>1) I can't change history lists with current browsers

You MUST NOT. It's private. But it would be possible
to do the things you want to do
by a safe command language on client side, which has
the ability to store information/objects.
A browser, who still has a safe command language is Java
from Sun (http://java.sun.com/).

This doesn't necessarily make it a good thing ;-) You can't and shouldn't
make any assumptions on the origin of documents from missing headers!

There is no reason to forbid caching of CGI scripts (actually from the
fact that you can't tell). A way of doing this is, if you don't get
a Last-Modified or a Expires header, to assume that the document was
last modified when the document was received. Then upon the next request
the cache can issue a "GET If-Modified-Since" and everything works fine!
If the update rate of the script results on the origin server is greater
than the request rate through the cache then band width is saved!

I hope this is not a silly question.

I've been working on a CGI script (in C) and discovered that
forward slashes put into a text field on a form get received
at the server as the string "%2F".  (And that tildes (~) are
received as "%7E" and colons as "%3A".)

Is this so that these characters can be interpreted by the
server for the particular OS they are running on?  For example,
forward slashes would be translated into backslashes on an NT
server? or what?

Am I correct that the browsers are doing this conversion?  I think
I am since that is what arrived in my stdin.  Why should browsers
do this instead of servers?

These are Hex Escapes (or something like that)...  That is a character 
encoded.  No matter what %7E should translate to ~.....etc.

Using a definition of history being that which actually happened, only

This relies on the assumption that when I fetch a URL I want the URL at

I think consider the following case clarifies the issue (it did for me).
History is not kept off screen but each new URL creates a new window.
Going back through history in this model is simply flicking back in the 
window stack.
Given that the URL in question has been continuously visible is it 
appropriate to delete it / reload it just because it is now the top 
window, not the second top window.

I assume these map to ASCII.  Does anyone know where there is a
