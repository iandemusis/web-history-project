Subject: Space after Periods
Status: RO

Rendered text usually has more space after a period that closes
a sentence than after a period that marks an abbreviation, 
or a comma.  I noticed today that Xmosaic 1.2 (and presumably 
earlier versions) automatically provide this extra space after
all periods.

That didn't surprise me, as Tex does the same thing; in Tex you
have to escape a period after an abbreviation such as U.N.\ like
that to avoid this extra space.  

How would it be reasonable to deal with this issue?  Is it a 
text-widget matter?  Do we need something in the DTD?  Would
a character entity (for "period-in-abbreviation") make sense?

Regards,

Subject: Searchable Indexes: LISTEN NOW!
Status: RO

Before anyone starts cron-jobs walking the web every 15 minutes, let's
get some things straight:

1) Sites should be able to just say ``No''.  If I don't want my ftp
site to appear on archie, I can say so -- the web should be the same.
2) Sites should be able to say ``Go away -- I've done it all for you''
and have the equivalent of ftp:/ls-lR.Z in /
3) Other collecting sites should be able to say ``here's what I got,
and the dates I got them on -- wanna swap info?''.  Why have 15 sites
walking the web and duplicating the effort?

Futhermore, all these things (or at least 1 and 2) should be in place
BEFORE the first web-wide test is made.

With all these in mind, and continuing the archie/veronica/jughead
tradition, allow me to suggest ``Josie and the Pussycats'' as a name
for this service.

The way I've dealt with the problem is to list only sites that seem to
be public.  The list of sites that I have are gotten from public
sources and I try and cull sites with any sort of restriction on them.

The trouble with ls-lR, is that it doesn't contain keyword and breadth
information.  Without such information, an index is very difficult to
deal with.

The entries were collected via a semi-automated process.  I have a TCL
script that generates a list of anchors of a document, but I usually
have to edit the resulting file by hand to add descriptions and such.

The trick now is to automate the process as much as possible.  
Is there a librarian in the house?

I'm suggesting a different method -- perhaps the URL
	http:/config.http
should have something like

<AutoSearch>false</AutoSearch>
<ArchieList>http://site/a/url/with/prebuilt/list/in</ArchieList>

> The trouble with ls-lR, is that it doesn't contain keyword and breadth

Which is why the format and contents of the archie-like files should
be agreed upon before anything is done.  That way the HTTP daemon can
be tweaked to provide these automagically, if need be -- local access
will (99.995%) always be (a) quicker, (b) smarter, and (c) cheaper.

NO!

:-)

But seriously, how is a text widget supposed to know where a sentence
ends and where it doesn't?  That sort of syntactic analysis we can't
do...

How about backslash space?  (The heretic strikes again...)

Frans,

Thanks for your explanation of X Mosaic's ALIGN attribute. I think
we need to separate text flow from the caption placement:

How about:

<!ELEMENT FIG - - (EMBED?, (FIGA|FIGT)*, (P | %list; | %text;)*)>
<!ATTLIST FIG
    id      ID      #IMPLIED
    flow    CDATA   #IMPLIED -- text flow to "right" or "left" --
    cap     CDATA   #IMPLIED -- caption on "left" or "right" --
    map     (map)   #IMPLIED -- server can handle mouse clicks --
    pix     (pix)   #IMPLIED -- use pixel coordinates --
    src     %URL;   #IMPLIED -- link to image data -->

With defaults set to: no text flow, and caption at bottom.

If FLOW is specified, then CAP is ignored and the caption is
always placed at the bottom,

Browsers should only flow text when there is sufficient room, this also
applies to left/right captions. Captions often last more than one line and
may even include a list, e.g. a list of features beside a product photo.

e.g. <FIG FLOW="left" SRC="...">  ;; picture at right with text flowed on left
     <FIG CAP="right" SRC="...">  ;; caption down right hand side

The width of normal text paragraphs is undefined. It normally stretches until
the righthand margin. So if you have more than a few words, it is necessary
to specify the desired width for text wrap.

> but what is the background color of a gif image ...

The idea of a chromakey for irregular shaped overlays is nice, but I am
unsure as to how to specify the colour value in a way that will work for
abitrary image/drawing formats. Any ideas?

We could allow an arbitary string value, and defer the problem?

Many thanks,

Dave Raggett

There are lots of httpds running on suns ... but to
debug your problem, I need more information!  In the
user manual there is a "debugging" flowchart. Please
follow that, and say where you get to.  Then include
the trace from client and server in your request.

Thanks, and sorry you have had problems.
If you have had a problem which you couldn't resolve using
the flowchart, please tell us, along with whether you
eventually resolved it and if so how... the flowchart is
only accumulated experience.

Hi all,

I have been trying to set up the CERN httpd server on a SUN IPX with
SunOS 4.1.3.

Unfortunately it does't work out that well for me. I have tried  
various
combinations of the library and daemon versions in the archive at
info.cern.ch. Could anybody with a SUN and a working httpd tell me  
what
version they got working?

Thanks,

Summarizing, we need

1.	A standard URL like http:/Catalogue.html

2.	A convention for saying "no" which could be just an existing
	but void file.

3.	A standard format for the file.

4.	A PD program distributed with the server to generate
	the file so that many people will do it weekly.

The format could be a set of
links where the content was the title of the document.
<a href="/docs/overview">Overview of our documentation</a>
which would have the advantage of human readability.
I agree it would be useful to have some depth information
or at least a weight.

It could be alternatively
	
	<LINK TITLE="Overview of hour documentation"
		HREF=""/docs/overview"
		WEIGHT= 0.654>
	
where we could argue for hours about the meaning of
WEIGHT. (WEIGHT is an extra, but the rest is standard
HTML).

In either case, a "no" catalogue could contain
a ploite message, and no list.

A FEW NUMBERS
	
From time to time I run a breadth-first traversal of the web from the
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Geographical.html list  
of servers. Yesterday, counting unique
hostname:port pairs (without checking for CNAME aliases),

	95	registered servers (level 0)
	99	servers refered to by level 0 (level 1)
	172	servers referred to by level 1 (level 2)
	174	distinct servers in levels 0-2.

Going this deep takes long enough (an hour or so).  I use a filter at  
each stage to cut out known slow sites (typically Eastern Europe) or  
known buggy servers.  I also have to clean the links quite a bit for
references with local hostnames only (not FQDN) and a small
amount of junk.  [Obviously mailing the webmaster at sites
with bad links would be a possibility.]

This is only for interest.  I don't generate a index.  The engine is
just a bunch of scripts using www -listrefs.

Yes - (but thats my fault :-)

The simplest way is to use a LINK element at the start of each doc
which indicates the parent doc. The parent doc uses the GROUP tag
to enclose a sequence of links to the children.

Unfortunately, I have yet to work out some of the details, like
how the browser knows to show NEXT and PREVIOUS toolbar buttons.
This could be via extending the LINK tag or with a new tag.

Note that you can use the GROUP tag to define nested hierarchies,
so the pointer from the child to the parent needs to indicate its
position in the hierarchy, e.g. via a "#" suffix and id on the URL.

In some cases, when a given document occurs in several independent
such lists, you can't provide an explicit pointer to the parent group.
In this case the link will have to be defined implicitly by virtue of
how the user navigates to the document. The details of how this might
work are all a bit hazy at this stage ...

Dave

p.s. The RFC for HTML+ I am currently writing will make the basic
     ideas a lot clearer.

 Please look at "http://moulon.inra.fr:80/oracle/readme.html" to see how

I know httpd is running on sun, thats why I was looking for pointers.
Thanks for offering to help me debug.

My server is working now. The problem was that I installed the software
while reading the install.csh script. 

The /etc/httpd.conf created in this scipt is apparently incorrect.

I had to add "file:" to make it work:
    map   /     /welcome.html
    map   /*     /Public/*
    pass  /Public/*
    fail  *

Here is the new:
    map   /     /welcome.html
    map   /*     file:/Public/*
    pass  file:/Public/*
    fail  *

Thanks for the help.

	Domain name seems to be the best way to split it.
	The problem is trading the cross-links, in case a
	node in Europe can only be found by links from the US.
	
	It would be simplified if one has the rule that
	you only trace from one place on any given host,
	preferably "/", so the various collectors would
	only have to trade hostnames and not every
	single document name.  It would be interesting
	to test that method.

I have changed libwww 2.10 to strip the trailing . and the :80 or 

:70 on http: and gopher: whenever an HTParse() of a URL is done
(ie all the time).  This should cure those two.
It should result in the end in URLs not being quoted with these
forms too, as editors will strip them out.

Perhaps not surprisingly, a lot of this discussion is reminiscent of
discussions that have taken place in the Gopher community. The existence
of global indexes like Veronica seems to be one of the few remaining
advantages of Gopher over WWW; providing global WWW indexes will be a
big step forward.

Besides Veronica, folks in Gopherspace have experimented with tools that
walk servers of interest and pull up new or changed titles. Folks who
run servers don't like to see automated widgets walking their entire
directory tree daily. So if you're going to invent a catalog structure,
you might also devise a format for a catalog of recent updates. (Yes, a
searcher could scan the overall catalog to accomplish this, but nicer to
spend the CPU once.)

Of course you want to be able to tell people to not index your Web, but
you might also want to be able to stop the indexing at a certain level.
The Gopher title index tool written by my colleague Dennis Boone allows
"stops" anywhere within the hierarchy; e.g. we don't want to index
Usenet News titles. I'm not sure how this idea would map to the Web, but
it's worth considering.

Conversely, it'd be nice to be able to advertise a particular document
as a logical starting point within one's server. For instance the root
page of your online multimedia version of Moby Dick would be a better
thing to have in a global index index than all 1000 pages within that
title.

In Veronica, it's possible to search for folders only. This narrows
searches considerably. Again, not sure how well this maps to the Web,
but it is a very useful feature. It'd also be nice to have an
automatically maintained list of all known home pages.

Will the catalog include document titles along with URLs? A major
disadvantage of Gopher indexes is that the document names are yanked out
of context, so you often don't know what an item named for instance
"Jobs Posting" means -- where it came from or what the context is. With
fully-specified URLs and with the titles, a global Web index would not
have this problem.

Summarizing, we need

1.	A standard URL like http:/Catalogue.html

2.	A convention for saying "no" which could be just an existing but void
	file.

3.	A standard format for the file.

4.	A PD program distributed with the server to generate the file so that
	many people will do it weekly.

Maybe some hints to HMTL+ will make it easier, something like:
    <DOCTYPE="homepage">
    <DOCTYPE="index">
I don't fully understand the problem but my point is that we might be
able to do a better job by making life easier for the indexing software.

This certainly is a good area to do some research.

Adding an attribute to HTML to indicate the role of a doc
        <HTML role=homepage>
would make a lot of sense, but DOCTYPE should not be the name
of that attribute, as it's a keyword in SGML.  (This assumes
that you're not suggesting getting into SUBDOC or anything

Yeah, whatever, I didn't think about DOCTYPE being SGML already, sorry.

Hi all,

I have been toying with the index from the Macintosh Archive at the
University of Michigan / Merit. I was so impressed to find descriptions
of the s/w there that I just _had_ to have it in the web.

Two perl scripts later, and 

	http://web.nexor.co.uk/mac-archive/welcome.html

looks like it works ok: you can browse through the descriptions,
request the files, and search for keyowrds. 

The maintainers of the mac.archive.umich.edu have expressed an interest in
this, so expect this service to move to the US...

As always, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Wait a second.... is the model a typewritten page or a published  
page? Typists follow the rule of adding an extra space between  
sentences within a paragraph. The rule for books (and by extension,  
anything that does not use a fixed-pitch, monospaced font) is to use  
the same space between sentences as between words. (I checked the  
standard references, both "Words into Type" and the "Chicago Manual  
of Style," on this.)

I'm not a Tex user, so I don't know why Tex adds the extra space. But  
it seems to me that there should be no issue here. 


A WWW document (which uses proportional fonts) should have the same  
space between sentences as between words. 


Besides, it's easier that way.

You should look at real books instead.

Tex adds the extra space because that's how many if not most
typographers think it should be, Chi Manual or not.

Xmosaic has correctly implemented more space after periods ending
a sentence.  >

To be more precise:
* Typewritten documents should have two spaces after sentence-ending periods.
* Word processed documents should use a single space.
* TeX and other typesetting programs often use a "long" space at the end of
sentences. It's more than a single space character, but much less than two.

Actually, I think most books don't do this any more. Newspapers certainly
don't. It's way too much trouble escaping out all the abbreviations. It
doesn't really add anything to readability.
 
I personally would prefer "one space fits all" as writers of HTML really
shouldn't need to know the fineries of typography (What's next? Range
kerning?), especially since it's not something 99.99% of people will notice
(i.e. it won't even look "wrong").

Then again, I didn't even notice until Terry mentioned so it's not a major
problem either way.

Terry Allen,

> You should look at real books instead.  


I beg your pardon?

If you mean books from O'Reilly, I see many use the double space  
convention, but at least one, your best-selling "Whole Internet  
User's Guide" uses a single space between sentences. In the  
publishing biz, I was taught to defer to "Words into Type" and the  
"Chicago Manual," just as we defer to the RFCs in the Internet world.

>  that's how many if not most typographers think it should be

Perhaps there's disagreement among typographers. Each publishing  
house is free to set its own style, and can allow different styles  
among books, too, as O'Reilly does. If you feel there's a strong  
argument for html documents digressing from the "Words into Type" and  
"Chicago Manual" conventions, I'd like to hear it. Perhaps offline.

Respectfully,
Daniel Kehoe

Subject: Searchable Indexes: LISTEN NOW!
Status: RO


At this year's Gophercon I boldly claimed that the proliferation of
names for services introduced unnecessary confusion among new users.
This hit the floor with a dull thud; folks *like* "Veronica". But
already there are brochures put out by self-styled Netexpert trainers
that speak as if Veronica is a separate entity that exists outside of
Gopherspace. From the perspective of rationality I claim that we don't
need yet another proper noun-denominated net service; call it "WWW
master index". From the perspective of marketing, a cute name might give
it visibility so as to rival Veronica.

Couple more Veronica notes, and I'll shut up:

Veronica isn't always  reliable. The harvest misses sites sometimes,
and is only done every two weeks currently. The idea of harvesting
catalogs provided by the server, rather than walking the tree, should
help a lot. Veronica doesn't do that yet; an opportunity for the Web to
do it right the first time.

Another bit of experience: the indexer shouldn't drop sites it can't
connect to. Carry their data until the next harvest. People have
complained about their titles disappearing from the index. (This has
been fixed in Veronica.)

Distribution of the Veronica database is currently accomplished by
FTPing the entire database (> 400M) from the master site. At some point
distributed updates will be essential.

FrameMaker doesn't have support for extra space after a sentence
either, and I must say I don't miss it.  I think it's mostly
propaganda by Knuth and Kernighan (TeX and troff) that makes people
want this.

Let's keep HTML simple!

                      July 1993 IETF Meeting in Amsterdam

                               BOF Session on

                      NETWORKING MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS

                                 (MULTIAPP)


   The above BOF is scheduled for 1930 to 2200 on Tuesday 13 July
   in Room H, RAI, Amsterdam.

   BOF Agenda:

     1. Introduction

     2. Identifying the issues

     3. Goals for future work

   One or two people have asked if they can formally present research
   projects, but it's not that sort of meeting.  As you can see from the
   abstract below, it is really oriented towards service development within
   the Internet.  If your research is relevant, please bring it up in the
   discussion, but there are no formal slots allocated for speakers within
   the BOF.

   If you are coming, you may wish to read [the summary of] a RARE report
   "Network Access to Multimedia Information".  You can fetch this by
   anonymous FTP from:

   Host:       ftp.ed.ac.uk
   Directory:  /pub/mmaccess
   Filenames:  report.doc    Report in Word for Windows 2 format (binary!)
               report.ps     Report in Postscript form
               report.txt    Report in ASCII text form
               summary.doc   Summary in Word for Windows 2 format (binary!)
               summary.ps    Summary in Postscript form
               summary.txt   Summary in ASCII text form
               *.*.Z         Each of the above files run through Unix
                             compress program (binary!)

Here's the abstract of what will be discussed at the BOF.

                             BOF ABSTRACT
                             ============

The ready availability of user-friendly multimedia authoring tools such
as Authorware Professional, Asymmetrix Multimedia Toolbook, Macromind
Director and many more, has stimulated much interest in multimedia
within the user community.  Sophisticated interactive multimedia
applications are being developed in many disparate subjects and for a
wide range of purposes.  Users are now beginning to ask us, as network
technologists, "how can I make my multimedia application available to
others across the network?".

In a parallel development, existing client-server network information
retrieval tools are being enhanced with multimedia handling features. 
Gopher+ for instance has been designed with multimedia data firmly in
mind.  The World Wide Web project is currently defining a new version of
its hypertext markup language, to be called HMML - HyperMedia Markup
Language - which includes multimedia support.

A third strand of activity is the emergence of network technologies
capable of carrying audio and video data across the network, initially
driven by multimedia conferencing applications.  Network technologies
such as ATM and protocols such as RTP are potentially capable of
handling isochronous multimedia data in an effective way. 

This BOF session will focus on issues which link these three strands. 
Particular questions to be addressed are:

* What are user requirements in terms of responsiveness, and what demands
  this places on the network and server system, and how these might
  be mitigated.

* The prospects for making existing interactive multimedia applications
  available over the network - eg by writing conversion tools from
  proprietary formats to a suitable open format.

* To what extent can existing network information retrieval tools such as
  Gopher, WWW, WAIS be used for sophisticated multimedia applications?
  What about the tools emerging from the research community such as
  AthenaMuse 2 (MIT), Microcosm (U of Southampton), HyperG (U of Graz)?
  Do we need another tool, or can we build on what we have?

* How can such tools be enhanced to take advantage of isochronous
  data streams?

* What relevance do standards such as HyTime and MHEG have?

* What are the security implications of providing interactive
  multimedia applications in an inter-enterprise environment?

The BOF is intended to test interest in the subject, to define issues
that need resoving, and to see whether a WG can be formed to work on
those issues.

Sounds interesting, but to avoid confusion with the SGML <!DOCTYPE HTML>
declaration, which points at a standard definition for the DTD, we should
think of another tag name.

e.g. <DOCUMENT CLASS="homepage">

Fine - I have added it to the HTML+ DTD.

Server Indexes:

It seems to me that each server should have some kind of standard README note
so you can list servers with a one liner description of what they are for.

Now if we could agree on a standard name and format ...

Sorry if this has already been said before.

Dave Raggett

p.s. how about:

Name: WWW_README.txt

The file contains email like header:

        Description: a few words only
        Contact: John D. Smith <smith@univ.edu

        Then a multi line description of who runs it
        and the aims and contents of this server.

Is there a good reason why it can't be an HTML file?  After all it is
describing an HTML server...

Marc,

There's an active effort underway to integrate PEM and MIME.  This
should give you exactly what you need.  See the Internet Draft
draft-ietf-pem-mime-02.txt for the current version.  Expect some
evolution during the upcoming IETF meeting.

When defining this file that would have an index of the local
server, it might be nice for it to be html compatible and
available to actual clients -- some sort of standard interface
that would be available at any server.

Boy, that sounds really muddled.

This is your last chance for comments!  Stop me now or forever hold
your peace.

I am ready to make changes to Lynx to implement the following improvements.

<link rev=made href="mailto:montulli@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu">

and

<a href="mailto:montulli@ukanvax.bitnet">

The first change, the "link" tag will enable document owners to
be defined in a document so that comments can be mailed directly
to the persons responsible for the documents content.

The second change, the "mailto:" url added to an anchor tag, will allow
mailing to anyone defined in the link.

Is this the way it should be done?  Cello has done it this way so I
assume it is.

Comments?

This is something we should talk about at the Workshop

How about some performance hacks for HTML+

One might be: <A HREF="..." FREQ=44>

Where FREQ is the probability that a user will select the link.
Of course, the browser would be free to throw in factors like the
user saw that yesterday, he might not want to read it again today.

This would allow browsers to fetch information in the background whil
the user is reading.

The FREQ data could be static (computed by the author) or it could
be added on the fly by the omniscient server :-)

Tony, I guess I'm just being dense.  What value is there in supporting

	<A HREF=... FREQ=44>
?

Is this meant to be the number of times a particular link has been
activated by a client?  I'm not sure what value there is here which is not
already kept in server logs.  I'd suppose that this same info could be
retrieved from logs, via ftp perhaps?

The consensus seems to be that no one wants to bother with
extra space after a period that ends a sentence.  There is
much confusion about why this was the traditional usage,
but no matter.  

Consequently, browser developers should suppress this spacing
if it is the default (Motif?) or not invoke it if it is 
optional.

<HTML>
<BODY>
<P>This sentence contains an abbreviation U.N. before its close.
The next sentence follows.
</BODY>

The space after U.N. should equal that after "close."

Fair enough?

I think that this is a bad idea.  Default treatment of spacing
after periods should be left up to individual browser developers.

See, there are at least the following three positions on the
"who controls the presentation" issue:

1) the source should not be allowed to control details of
   the presentation

2) the source should be able to explicitly override browser
   preferences on presentation details

3) presentation defaults should be standardized so that
   the source determines the presentation on any browser

Your suggestion is in the spirit of #3.  Not only do I (as
both an author and a developer) like #2 better, but I think
it is the only one with the potential of scaling up.

So, getting back to the particular issue, we should let the
browser decide on post-period spacing and perhaps add a
mechanism to HTML+ to stipulate the author's preference.

It would be a convenient way for the browser to rank all of the
possible paths from the current document and therefore do prefetching.
In other words, if I (an information provider) know that the link
"General information" on the NCSA home page is the most common link
selected by people who access the home page, then I could use this
FREQ attribute to encode that in the document itself and therefore a
smart browser could prefetch whatever's at the other end of that link
each time (or the first time, or whatever) a user accessed the home
page.

(I think this shouldn't be part of the markup language; however, it's
fun to think about how it could be pulled off otherwise.  I'm in favor
of a local agent that watches all dataflow in and out of my system and
can therefore learn to predict what I'm going to do next.)

Yes, HTML isn't the right place for this information (shame on me).  But
the user agent is going to need some outside help from somewhere (whether
it is peering with other clients or a "usage pattern" server).

I talked with Rob Raisch yesterday about his "Registrar URN Service" which
might actually be a better place to store this information.  You send it
a URN and it returns a (possibly ordered) list of URLs and some auxiliary
information.  This could be adapted to include the information we need if
can agree that it's the right place to do it (which it very well may not
be, it's not clear to me that it has all the information it needs to make
informed decisions).

Anyway, something to think about.

(a) Built-in bitmaps for browsers that support inlined images.  
    <IMG SRC="internal-foo"> would refer to a specific built-in
    bitmap, where "foo" could be something like one of...

        leftarrow-small
        rightarrow-small
        leftarrow-large
        rightarrow-large
        uparrow-large
        downarrow-large
        uparrow-small
        downarrow-small
        checkmark-small
        checkmark-large
        skull-and-crossbones
        stoplight
        gopher-menu
        gopher-image
        gopher-sound
        gopher-index
        gopher-binary
        gopher-telnet
        gopher-web

    These bitmaps would be known to be available to document authors,
    and non-graphical clients could possibly use a textual supplement
    (e.g. "[LEFT]" for leftarrow-large, etc.).  The bitmaps wouldn't
    need to necessarily look exactly the same from client to client.

(b) An optional parameter for <LI> to allow specification of a pointer
    to an image to inline (rather than using a bullet or whatever).
    This would let one do something like:

    <UL>
    <LI IMG="internal-gopher-menu"> A Gopher menu.
    <LI IMG="internal-gopher-image"> A weathermap.
    </UL>

    ... and then one would get a slick bitmap-enumerated list.  Again,
    text-based clients could substitute the normal list style or
    textual equivalents (e.g., "[menu]" and "[image]").

Whaddaya think?

Marc:

There are some things I like a lot about the idea of a stock library
of "imagelets".  I'm still VERY mindful of the plight of
those who get to the Web via low-speed mechanisms like SLIP, since it
takes in roughly 99.99% of attorneys in private practice and most of
what you might call the "home" market. My
thought was that if and as inlined images were added to Cello, I was
going to give users the option to have an "images automatically/images
by demand" switch, just to get around the delays inherent in pumping
large graphics files around at SLIP speeds.  (Incidentally I'd also
thought about having some Mac-ish bullets for Gopher menu items in
Cello and put it in the "nice to have someday" list.  I'll get to it.
Really.)

But before the shooting starts over "which images should we all
support and what should they be" permit me to make an observation and
a modest proposal.  As Marc implies by his list there are a few
(hopefully as few as possible) stock icons and bitmaps associated with
the underlying protocols supported by the Web -- bitmaps associated
with all the Gopher data "types", a file folder and a directory symbol
for FTP (which you need for Gopher anyway) and maybe some sort of
group and article symbol for the News.  I submit that any and
all other "stock imagelets" above and beyond this should be the
responsibility of  the publisher to distribute as a package; otherwise
we'll be arguing until h--l freezes over about what should and
shouldn't be part of the "standard bitmap library".  What I'd like to
see is a way of specifying -- for an image or anything else -- is a
way of saying "this is something that you should transfer across the
Net once and keep locally forever if possible".

For instance, suppose I'm offering some sort of periodical which
frequently uses a particular set of imagelets known and used by a
particular professional group, or even something with which my
audience is familiar and has come to expect in an equivalent print
publication. A lot of legal publishers use specialized bulleting
characters or footnote symbols in this way -- for example, West
Publishing's little image of a key, used to indicate a reference to
their key numbering system. What I would do ideally is put a link
somewhere where my readers would all see it which would transfer the
imagelet library _for my publication_ to their host once and leave it
available to them for all time.  But on the off chance that they would
be too lazy/impatient to do this right off, I would want to flag
imagelets in subsequent texts as "library images" so that the reader
could transfer them as they were encountered, but hang on to them more
or less forever, independent of whatever caching scheme is in use on
their browser. 

Incidentally, this would also allow publishers who want to do some
experimentation on the Net but are nervous about affecting their print
business to do some interesting tinkering with the Net product -- you
could offer "text only" and "text with imagelets" as two diferent
services, with the image library being shipped to the user directly in
return for (here comes the lynching party, Tom) -- er, uh, money.

Within a couple of days we expect to make a general announcement of an
experiment which we have undertaken with The Nasdaq Stock Market, in
which we're electronically distributing a quarterly publication of
theirs called the <I>Financial Executive Journal</I>.  This idea is
something which would have come in amazingly handy in putting that
together.  It became very clear to me in talking to them that many
publishers, particularly those who deal with a fairly restricted
audience of professionals, have spent a lot of time developing
graphical cues in their publications which through repeated usage have
acquired a lot of meaning which may be difficult or impossible to
capture in generic markup.  You need the imagelet itself, and you need
it often, since these things tend to appear many times in a document
and series of documents.   Marc's idea, with some refinements, would
answer this need.

Incidentally a not-quite-finished version of the Nasdaq thang is at
http://fatty.law.cornell.edu/usr2/wwwtext/nasdaq/nasdtoc.html

Tb.

I think it's a great idea, but shouldn't we have image types for ALL
the gopher types.  We should also have a search-large and search-small
as generic search icons.  

Maybe it would be better to make all of the icons more generic.  
Instead of gopher-sound, why not use just "sound" to represent 
any sound, or "binary" to represent any binary file.  These 
will obviously be useful for FTP menus as well as gopher
menus.  It may also be nice to have a genaric MIME icon or something
to represent mpeg movies and such.

I think the idea to add icons to <li> tags has merit, but may over
complicate things.  Couldn't we extend the definition of <dl> to
NOT require a <dd>, which would give us a list structure without
a dot.  Then we could add a <IMG> tag to display an icon within
the <dt>.  This would look the same wouldn't it?  Thats how I have
put together some menus here.

Well, there are no personal feelings here: if the image is a photo,  
then Y should point up: I believe that when I see a map or a  
landscape, I measure things higer in higher coordinates.
If the image is a drawing, then all draftsmen would agree to have Y  
point up.
The ONLY case in which I can see a slight advantage to have Y point  
down is text, and that should be editable text, not pixels. A  
PostScript original image certainly has Y pointing up. This is also  
the only reason that was taken for pointing Y down on bitmapped  
displays: it was just an extension of the line-count on character  
grid terminals.
Just think of placing the sensitive rectangles using real tools on a  
screen: When I place a rectangle in any serious drawing program I  
know of (I do not include MacPaint of course!), the position of the  
mouse is given with Y pointing up.
This is what we have to think of, not what has already been done.
Robert.

Re built in bitmaps for browsers...

I am concerned that the WWW clients will grow to
unbearable sizes, and that the set of internal bitmaps
would grow without bounds as each one lobbied for his/her
favorite cute icon.  

What's the justification for the feature?  Why not just
use ordinary inlined images?  

(I expect there's a good reason, but it's not explicit
in the proposal.  If you make it explicit we might be
able to devise a better (more general or less expensive)
mechanism to meet the same design requirements.)

If these are going to be universal bitmaps, then you
need to provide a specification so that people can
make equivalents for them on other browsers/platforms;
perhaps you need a universal bitmap format so we can
have the same appearance on diff platforms, and maybe you
need to define the intended semantics of the icons.


best wishes

If understand the original suggestion, it was not intended that the
bitmaps be internal to all the browsers, simply that there by a well
known set of names for common ones so that non-text browsers could cope.

If all browsers co-operate in this way, and intelligently cache the
icons, then in fact it should reduce the overall number of personal
preferences, and eliminate internally hardcoded icons from browsers altogether.

Of course, maybe you're right, and I'm reading to much into it....

But please God, nobody invent another "universal" bitmap format. There
are enough already. As far as I'm aware, that's the idea - a name which
implies the meaning, i.e. "home-icon" would draw a standard picture of
a little house, or "HOME" on a dumb terminal.

Yup...

It certainly may be that this is a bad idea, that each information
provider should provide his/her own set of bitmaps which are served
normally over the network as is done now, etc.  I just think it would
be nice if there were a fairly consistent "palette" of icons that
could be used liberally and would stand a good chance of being
represented in non-graphics displays as well... I think the user
interface of the overall system would benefit.

What do you developers think about changing all of the informative
user messages that currently come out of the WWW library into some
sort of standard user_message call.

Currently there are several modules that use differing forms of user
messages when they are in use.  HTNews uses NEWS_PROGRESS or some
such define which is defined to be a "printf".  HTAccess uses either
"printf" or user_message.  If all of these messages could be expressed
using the same routine my life would be alot simpler.  I suggest
using something like "HTinfo_popup" or "HTuserMessage" or something along
those lines.  The client could define "HTuserMessage" to be just a
"printf", or a popup window or a statusline message.

I would be willing to go find as many of the messages I can and change
them to this format if neccessary.

don't take me seriously, I never do,

This is a pre-release announcement for version 2.0.10 of the Lynx hypertext
browser.  Anyone who would like to do a little pre-testing of Lynx before
it's official release is invited to participate.

file://aixtest.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx2-0-10.tar.Z

This release of Lynx has been compiled by me on the following platforms:

   IBM (AIX 3.2, 3.1)
   DEC (Ultrix, VMS)
   Sun 3 and 4
   NeXT (Mine is an older version of NeXTStep, but it should work 
	 with newer ones too)

Binaries for the following platforms are available.
   IBM (AIX 3.2, should work for 3.1 as well)
   Ultrix
   Sun 4
   VMS (for multinet)

Try it out and send any bug reports and or fixes to:
mailto:montulli@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu

I'm going to be at a Z39.50 conference Tues-Fri so don't expect immediate
replies.  (Maybe when I get back I'll write a Z39.50 '92 access protocol
module.  Yeah right! :)

The instructions for compiling on a VMS system are a little weird since
the new WWW Library won't compile on VMS yet.  Therefore Lynx must use the
older 1.X library under VMS.

Otherwise Lynx is now fully compatible and preferentially uses version
2.X of the WWW Library.

If you would rather wait for the productional release, expect it sometime
this weekend.

I think that this is a great idea, especially in GUI environment where
printf does not really work. The error messages are scattered
all throughout the code, which makes them hard to modify for a
particular platform. What I would also like to do is give user the
opportunity to correct an error.

For example, when a file ends in an unknown extension, user should be
able to specify how does he want to parse it, save it to the disk,
etc. Or when anonymous ftp refuses connection, user should be able to
try again with a different password. Right now making any choices
inside the WWW lib is hard.

I would like to see a substitute for a printf method that is flexible
enough to support useer input. The ideal interface would be something
like this:

The error routine is void * ErrorAlert(short errorNumber, ...).
Arguments following errorNumber are equivalent to printf. All the errors,
and their reasons would be declared in a header file. There, arguments
expected for each type of alert would be listed, as well as arguments
expected to be returned from ErrorAlert. In case when user can take
action upon error, an argument returned from ErrorAlert would specify
the action to be taken.

This would give programs that use the library flexibility we need so
that we do not hack the insides of its code.

Right, but if you want some mechanism that is as powerful as "exec:",
your server will have to run with privilege.  Remember, I want
"exec:" to be more than just a dynamic HTML source, it can also
modify the user's files (like a .newsrc for rn.html).  Even the
safer things like a fancy file browser need to run as the user
so that they can see all the files available to that user.

So what kind of facilities do we propose be added to a server
that will allow it to do the things "exec:" can do?  That is,
what's the alternative?

I'm sorry if I'm beating this to death, but the truth is that I'm
already using some form of "exec:" and will continue to do so.
It would be so much better if there were a standard way to do this
since I'm sure there are lots of others who want to do the same thing.
Even an agreement like "We really think exec: is a bad idea, but if
you must, do it this way..." would be valuable.

Don't forget, not all messages are errors.  There are progress messages like
"connecting to news host" and such.  I also think that there should be much
more progress messages, at least as an option, to let the user know whats
going on.  I don't mean trace mode, but something that shows at least
resonable progress.  

We could use standards similar to, or the same
as X windows, with "informative" dialogs, "alert" dialogs, and "error" 
dialogs.  Alert dialogs could give the user a chance to respond, error
and informative dialogs would just inform, not query.

I think the right place for this information is in a header returned from
an HTRQ server.  The server protocal is specifically designed to return
information on a document like this without having to bother getting the
document itself.

Not anymore I hope. :)

Mising from this list is my preference:

4) The source should be able to hint to the browser how it should
   be presented.  The browser can choose to ignore these hints.

Unfortunately, there appears to be a clear division on where information
providers and information consumers stand on this issue.  In traditional
media, information provides have complete control over the presentation
of information and do not seem to want to give up this control in the
new digital media.  Users, on the other hand, don't want to be locked
into a specific presentation format.  I can sympathize with the infomation
providers who want information to be viewed in their distinctive format,
but as an information consumer I'm not going to stand for this.

Agreed.  The module of user interface messages is already there in  
fact, ready to be overridden in the GUI case. It is HTAlert and
is described in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Implementation/HTAlert.html
There is now a link to this (to and) from the internals page.

Routines are

	HTAlert,		(warning)
	HTPrompt,		(user input)
	HTProgress,		(informational)
	HTConfirm		(message, OK/Cancel response)

Precicely.  The problem is, not all the libwww code uses these
routines at the moment.

Subject: Again Sp after Per
Status: RO


I asked a similar question on comp.text.sgml, and got a good
suggestion from Anders Thulin:  if you want to maintain the
traditional convention of more space after a period that ends
a sentence, tag the abbreviations <ABBREV>U.N.</ABBREV>
and let the browser or formatter do the right thing.

I think the alternatives are to introduce an Abbrev tag or 
settle for no extra space after a period.  If this detail
of formatting is to be included in a style sheet or determined
by the user, it could be through a FRENCHSPACING toggle
(=YES or NO) somewhere.  The term is from Tex; frenchspacing 
is no extra space after a period.

I would be happy to settle for frenchspacing for WWW, at least for
now.  Or we could get into the question of what spacing should
follow a colon . . .

This is a LOT more work than I want to have to deal with for
something almost no one will notice.

Frenchspace, frenchspace, frenchspace!

Well, now that everyone knows my opinion about that, how about
hyphens, em dashes and en dashes? It should be

-   = hyphen
--  = en dash
--- = em dash

(Or is this already fixed in HTML+?)

When a link points to a gopher file, isn't the information about what type of 
data being pointed to already provided in the URL?

e.g.  gopher://ecn.purdue.edu/I9/Some_nifty_graphic 
	Is known to be a "gopher-image" because of the I9.

I would think it wouldn't be too hard for the client to display a small
bitmap instead of a bullet when it sees something like this in the link. As
soon as you move out of gopher provided information, the problem becomes very
murky, and an optional parameter like the one you suggest would probably be
just about the only way to do it without a lot of headaches.

Subject: help with simple indexed phone book...
Status: RO


Hi:
   I'm trying to get a simple phone book set up on
our WWW server. 

Here's what I have so far:

* CERN's httpd running on a Sun.
* an html file with the <ISINDEX> tag called /phonebook
* a csh script called findit that given a keyword,  searches
  the address database and creates an html formatted file
  called phonebook?<keyword> of the requested data.
  (where keyword is the first name or last name of the
   person the user wishes the phone number of)

the question:

   How do I tell the httpd that when it gets the command
GET /phonebook?<keyword> to run "findit <keyword>"?
Is this something I do in /etc/httpd.conf?  If so, can
anyone point me to a discussion of the format of the
rules that you put into /etc/httpd.conf?  If not, how
DO you do this?  Do I need to modify the source for
httpd?  If so, what do I need to change?  RTFM is fine -
but please tell me what FM...  If this is not the
appropriate list to post to please tell me where it
should have been posted.

All help is appreciated.
Thanks,
Susan Coghlan

It seems to me that the browser under control of the user can

I wanted to respond because I believe the two points of view 
you describe can be reconciled.  What is unfortunate, in my view,
is that presentation is undervalued in SGML forums and overvalued
in PostScript/Acrobat forums.  (So, I tailor my presentation
according to the forum!)

The role of presentation in an
online document is similar to the role the user interface plays
in an application.  Most developers think of the interface as a
separate but very important part of a software product these days.
Don't you make choices for the user in organizing the interface?
Those choices can be made independently of how the underlying
engine works; ultimately, without an interface, though, the engine
is unusable.   The author and designer of a book attempt to organize and
present information effectively.  Just as a developer expects
to design a user interface for a program, so the publisher expects
to design a presentation that suits the information.  Just
because presentation can be understood to be separate from
the content does not mean it is expendable or optional.  I can't
offer a good definition of presentation value, but some people use it
to in a way that makes me believe they think it is superfluous.  
(I suppose some programmers regard User Interface issues with
the same contempt.)
A publisher needs to be able to rely on presentation capabilities
to organize information effectively.
The publisher should be able to control presentation but that
does not mean he should have absolute control over it. 

A developer may allow the user to configure
the user interface and even override the packaged UI design.
That does not keep the developer
from making choices for them.   A developer doesn't ship an API to end users,
although he might provide one for providing direct access
to the engine outside the UI.
Who would want to buy a product in which the user *starts* by 
configuring the menubar and menu items and specifying their
connection to the underlying engine. 

Another point is that presentation can be very widely defined
to mean everything or almost nothing.  A user can't take a
command-line interface and make it into a GUI interface. The developer
needs to take the different capabilities into account.  
On the other hand, changing the font used for the display 
of menu items doesn't really matter very much to the functionality
of the program.  Nor does the fact that, when porting an Open LOOK program 
to Motif, the change in appearance of the menu change the program.
There is similar rigidity and flexibility in online presentation.

In summary, the presentation aspect of an online document might be
considered closer to the user interface that organizes
functions of a program.   As authors, we want to know what aspects 
of presentation can be controlled to help us organize information for readers.

Subject: Searches, problems with
Status: RO

Two parts to this post -- an answer for Susan, and a discussion of the
problem highlighted by Susan's post.

Searching
---------
The answer to your question, Susan, lies in the way that the clients
and servers work.  When the client finds an <ISINDEX> tag in a
document, it knows it has a cover page for a search.  When the user has
entered keywords for the search, the client requests exactly the same
URL as the cover page, but appends
	?word+word+word
to the end of it.  This means that the *server* receives the URL
	/path/to/coverpage?word+word+word

The default behaviour for an unmodified CERN server (as far as I know)
is to go ``this server doesn't allow searches'' whenever it receives a
?word+word style URL.  In order to have your search activated, the
server would need to call the shell script with the search keywords as
arguments.

What I did to get around it, was write my cover-page *and* the search
module as a shell script which was then called by inetd.  Instead of
making a link to http://machine:80/document, I made a link to
http://machine:9080/document (9080 being the port in inetd.conf).

DISCUSSION
----------

This is an ugly hack!  What I would much rather prefer to see is
	<ISINDEX HREF=http://machine:9080/document>
where the URL after HREF= is the bit to append the ?word+word to.

Also, a version of the CERN server that can be configured (in the
httpd.conf script) to define allowable suffixes for the search
programs, eg
	search 	.p
	search .sh

Then, when the server gets a request for URL?word+word+word, it splits
up the words, and calls
	URL.p word word word
or
	URL.sh word word word

  Another point is that presentation can be very widely defined
  to mean everything or almost nothing.  A user can't take a
  command-line interface and make it into a GUI interface. The developer
  needs to take the different capabilities into account.  

You will note, tho, that many of the GUI forms of systems are really
built out of clever interfaces on top of command-line stuff.  Much of
the catchy World Wide Web stuff (the PARC map of the world, the
various archie servers) and even commercial stuff (GENIE "Aladdin",
Compuserve "CIM") are at their core really only just someone taking a
command-line interface and making it into a GUI interface.  

Dan Farmer had an interesting "works in progress" paper at usenix in
Cincinnati where he talked about taking the "G" out of "GUI" and
separating the design cleanly between "Graphical" and "User
Interface".  His key comment was that GUIs tend to be built where the
graphical stuff has seeped quite deeply into the underlying code, and
thus it's hard to pull off the top layer and add on a new or different
look.

For on-line documents the similar observation would be that we are
making a lot of assumptions about the viewer that people are using
when we go to design a text to be read on the screen, and if those
assumptions are wrong the result it going to be icky.  Consider all of
the "texinfo" screens aimed at a 24x80 (or at best at 60x80) vt100
style screen and a nicely laid out typeset manual; is the proper
rendering into World Wide Web more book-like or more Info-like?
Or should it be both?  Do you expect people to read and browse with
the pageup/pagedown keys or the left/right/up/down arrows, and how
does the availability of bitmap fonts change that?

Subject: WWW vs. WAIS
Status: RO

I am thinking of setting up a WWW server for multiple databases, with pointers
from one database to the others. Also, certain of these pointers will
point to 2D images.

I am having an argument with someone telling me that everything I am doing
with WWW, I can also do with WAIS. Can anybody summarize the advantages
of WWW vs. WAIS, especially in regard to multiple databases and 2D image
retrieval, or point me to some existing paper describing this?

Thanks.

Yup.

Because the Gopher communications module simply produces a HTML stream
(either tokenized or raw) that looks like:

<ul>
<li> <a href="gopher://blahblah/blah">An entry.</a>
<li> <a href="gopher://blahblah/blah">An entry.</a>
<li> <a href="gopher://blahblah/blah">An entry.</a>
</ul>

...or something similar.  Yes, this could all be hacked so the Gopher
stuff is handled extra-special-different, but it would be much cleaner
to simply support the concept of arbitrary icons as bullets in
unnumbered lists.  I think.

In several papers, I have read about virtual and real documents.
How does one build (and send back to the client) a VIRTUAL DOCUMENT, for

That can be done in quite a simple way.. the easiest way is to modify the
HTTP server so that it creates a temporary file, then calls up a routine 

which handles the request and writes to that file, then sends and afterwards 

deletes it.
Here's an excerpt from our Server:
..
  tmpfile = (char *)tmpnam(NULL);
  sprintf(buf,
  "sh /LocalLibrary/httpd_index %s '%s' %s >/dev/null 2>/dev/null",
   file,keybuf,tmpfile);
  system(buf);
  if(stat(tmpfile,&finfo) == 0)
  {
     sprintf(logbuf,"INDEXFILE = %s\n",tmpfile);
     printl;
     send_file(tmpfile,fd);
     unlink(tmpfile);
  }
..
This is a bit of a dirty hack, but it works just fine :-)

Hope that helps,
Chris

Even better you can just:

   fprintf(ns, "<TITLE>Search Results</TITLE>\n");
   fprintf(ns, "...\n");

In Plexus I do this all the time.  Calling it a "virtual document" is
really just a fancy way of saying you generate the data on the fly
instead of just returning a fixed file.  You can also pass existing
data through a filter (like the man page filter) or you can do anything
else you can think of (run a macro preprocessor like m4 over it etc).

Here is registrar.  Comments are very welcome, and feel free to play.  The
next document explains the distribution of registrar servers (a few days),
and then a paper describing the sonar (repository availability) protocol.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick synopsis:

	Registrar is a 'product' registry which serves various pieces of
information when given a unique URN.  One of the returned 'attributes' is
a 'product instance record' which contains a URL, content type, content
encoding, content size, access authority, billing authority, and cost records.

	Registrar is available on port 99, server 'ruby.ora.com' and
offers help information upon receiving a HELP command, eg.

	% telnet ruby.ora.com 99

              Registrar -- Resource Registration Service

                       manager, online services

Assumptions:
-----------

     This document assumes that  the reader is conversant  in the form  and
function of Uniform Resource Locators (URL).  It would also be very helpful
if the reader were at least aware of the URI working group, and its efforts
to identify some of the issues addressed in this document.


Scope:
-----

     This document discusses an implementation for a Uniform Resource  Name
or Notation (URN)  server.   It describes  how the  URN can  map to  useful
information associated with a unique  product, and provide the location  of
instances of this product on the network.  This information can be used  to
automate retrieval of such products from multiple repositories.


Definitions:
-----------

               Instance -  an  existing specimen  of  an product  which  is
          indistinguishable from another instance of the same product based
          on the declaration of its owner.

               Product - a Product is any information declared by its owner
          to be unique and available.   That product might be available  in
          different formats  or  encodings, and  distributed  in  different
          repositories.

               Registrar - a  service which maps  a unique URN  to zero  or
          more Product Instance Records, which contain URLS.  It is also  a
          service which caches other important information which is  unique
          to a product.

               Uniform Resource  Name (URN)  -  a URN  is a  notation  that
          uniquely identifies a product.   The actual form of a  particular
          URN is up  to the  authority which  maintains responsibility  for
          that variety of URN, and  this document talks about one  possible
          form which meets the current needs of the author.  URNs take  the
          form: authority:opaque_data,  and  that the  authority  discussed
          here is called 'registrar.'

               Uniform Resource Locator (URL) -  a URL is that  information
          which allows the retrieval of a particular instance of a product.

               Product Attribute (PA) - a  Product Attribute is some  piece
          of information  which can  be attached  to the  declaration of  a
          product, and retrieved from a product registry server.

               Product Instance Record  (PIR) - a  Product Instance  Record
          contains the information particular to a specific instance of  an
          Product.


Issues:
------

     The Uniform Resource  Locator (URL) contains  information required  to
retrieve a single instance of a network resource.  It contains the name and
location of the instance, as well as the proper method used to retrieve it.

     While this is  useful information  once the decision  to retrieve  the
instance  has  been  made,  it  does  not  address  the  broader  and  more
complicated issues of whether or not we should retrieve the instance in the
first place,  and whether  or not  we can  use the  instance once  we  have
retrieved it.

     The information in the  URL is insufficient to  allow us to make  this
decision and so, we must look elsewhere to satisfy our needs.

     Thus, the primary concept  behind the REGISTRAR  server is to  provide
enough information  about  a particular  product  so  that a  number  of  a
decisions can be made regarding its accessibility and value.

     Currently, some of  the information required  to make an  'appropriate
retrieval decision' is available, but much is based on the assumption  that
the agent which makes the retrieval has this information before the  actual
URL is used.  In most cases, this is information which the  user possesses.
The user may understand that retrieving an instance from a '*.ac.uk' domain
would be less efficient than getting it from '*.berkeley.edu.' based on her
understanding or assumptions of the underlying structure of the network.

     Assuming that  we  have  already  made  the  decision  to  retrieve  a
particular product from the network, we will need the following information
to decide where we can retrieve it from, and whether or not we can use  the
instance once we retrieve it:

        - Is the instance available via a retrieval mechanism we can use?  
          (Instrumentality)

        - Is the instance available from a source (server) to which we have
          access?  (Availability)

	- Is the instance of a type which we can use? (Type)

        - Is the instance in a form which we can use? (Encoding)

	- Is the instance small enough to save and manipulate on our local
	  system? (Size)

	- Are we allowed to retrieve the instance? (Access)

	- If the instance is only available for a fee, can we pay for it?
          (Billing)

	- If the retrieval of this instance is billable, can we pay for it in
	  a currency which we use? (Payment)

Instrumentality -

     The instrumentality issue is addressed  by that portion of the  user's
application which allows or facilitates retrieval.  If the engine does  not
support retrieval using a particular  protocol or service, the  application
will, no doubt, inform the user.

Availability -

     When we  request the  instances  associated with  a  URN, we  will  be
presented with a  list of those  sites which store  those instances.   This
list, however does  not address whether  or not we  actually have  physical
access to any of the listed sites.

     Whether or not  a  particular instance of a  product is available,  in
terms of the  availability of the  repository site, is  an important  issue
relating to the  question of retrieval.   If the  instance is available  on
multiple repositories, we should  have access to  enough information to  be
able to make the 'best' retrieval decision.

     Best in  this  context refers  to  size of  repository  hardware  (its
'power'), its current load, how long  it takes to return a request  ('ping'
time), and how many network 'hops' a request must traverse.

     There is  another  protocol, SONAR  -  currently in  prototype - which
answers this issue.  We can  assume that SONAR provides enough  information
to the  REGISTRAR server  so that  when  it returns  a number  of   PRODUCT
INSTANCE RECORDS, those records  are in a sorted  order (best first,  worst
last) in terms of  their suitability as 'appropriate'  sites from which  to
retrieve a product.

     NOTE: SONAR is not meant  as a 'user' protocol,  (in the sense that  a
client program interacts with it, as an agent for a user), as REGISTRAR is.
Rather it  is  an  'inter-server' protocol,  used  only  between  REGISTRAR
servers.

Type -

     If an  instance is  in a  native format  or type  we do  not  support,
retrieving it is of little value.  Native format is that form which is used
directly by a application; eg.  ascii, postscript(tm), bitmap, etc.

Encoding -

     If an instance is in  an encoding which we  are unable to render  back
into its native type or format, the instance is of little use.  (Unless  we
can contract with a service which does the conversion for us?) This is  the
issue of  compression  and conversion  into  a form  more  appropriate  for
network delivery, eg.  unix-compress, uuencode, etc.

     There is no information  included in the URL  which deals with  either
issue.  Historically, the question of applicability of a certain  encoding,
or the availability of the required  program to uncompress an instance  has
been handled  by the  user  of the  application.   The  user has  made  the
decision to retrieve a  particular instance based on  her knowledge of  its
usefulness once it has been retrieved.

     This state of affairs is  becoming increasingly intolerable since  the
user can and should  no longer be called  upon to make these  distinctions.
As the user  base increases, (mostly  in the  low end of  network saavy  or
expertise), there will be more of a  need for agents or services which  can
make these decisions for the user.

Size -

     If an instance is too large to cache locally, and cannot be  retrieved
in pieces, it is of little value.  Information related to the size of each
particular instance is needed to make an appropriate retrieval decision.

Access -

     If we have decided that we can use an instance, we still must find out
whether or not we have permission to access that instance.

     (To be completed later.)

Billing -

     If we  have  permission  to  access an  instance,  assuming  that  the
instance is only available to those who  can pay for it, we must next  find
out if the billing authority which maintains control over the instance will
accept payment from us?

     (To be completed later.)

Payment -

     If we can pay, what will we pay?

     (To be completed later.)

	

The Uniform Resource Name:
-------------------------

     The Uniform  Resource  Name  is  a single,  unique  identifer  for  an
abstract product.

The following rules apply to URNs:

	-	Once created, a URN can never be destroyed.

	-	The actual encoding of the URN, (how it looks), is 
		completely immaterial to its function.  The actual
		content of a URN is that to which it refers.

	-	URNs are *never* created 'on the fly.'  A URN is provided
		as a pointer to a product when that product is registered
		with the authority responsible for its existance. Humans
		never make URNs, servers do.


Implementation:
--------------

     There is a prototype REGISTRAR server operating on ruby.ora.com,  port
99.  It supports all  of the features previously  identified, as well as  a
number of useful additions, such as keyword searching among products and  a
test interface to the local SONAR server.

     The server is a standard TCP session, similar to the 'finger' service,
and can be accessed via the 'telnet' program.

     The command/response structure is simple, and it should be quite  easy
to write clients for it.  Its general rules are

     o    Requests to the REGISTRAR server are in ASCII, and are  delimited
          with CR/LF.

     o    Requests to the  server are  either commands or  URN /  ATTRIBUTE
          pairs.

     o    Commands which the server understands are:

            HELP  --  returns a '.' delimited list of available commands.

            DEBUG --  toggles debugging output from the server.

            LIST  --  lists a '.' delimited list of registered URNs.

            SEARCH [keyword] --  returns a '.' delimited list of URNs which
                                 contain the keyword.

            QUERY [server]   --  returns a single line of information
                                 (from SONAR) which lists certain data
                                 about the mentioned server.  
                                 (EXPERIMENTAL - NOT ACTIVE)

            QUIT  --  Ends the session.

     o    URN  /  ATTRIBUTE  requests  are  used  to  retrieve   particular
          attributes from a product record.  Without an explicit ATTRIBUTE,
          the INSTANCE  attribute  is  assumed.    Thus,  these  are  valid
          requests

              registrar://ora/category/item:version
                       returns the INSTANCE attributes of the product

              registrar://ora/category/item:version CREATOR
                       returns the CREATOR attribute of the product

              registrar://ora/category/item:version ALL
                       returns all of the available attributes of the
                       product, including the DESCRIPTION property which
                       is otherwise unavailable.

     o    Responses all begin with a numeric, in the following form:

            0xx  --  Command failed.

            1xx  --  Command succeeded.

     o    Any response which  begins with a  dash ('-') is  a comment or  a
          debug or help message and can be safely ignored by the client.

Format of a URN:
---------------

       authority://domain/category/name:version_major.version_minor

     o    authority is  the  descriptor which  defines  the format  of  the
          following fields.

     o    domain is a reference to  the responsible entity which  maintains
          all members of  a particular  name space.   (NOTE:  Based on  the
          transience of hostnames and domains in the Domain Name Service on
          the Internet, this is not to  be assumed to represent a  hostname
          or domain.  We assume that the actual host or hosts which support
          a particular  domain  would  be  kept in  a  'top  level'  domain
          authority, registered  with the  proper authority  (IANA),  which
          would be  queried  and cached  to  retrieve the  proper  host  to
          contact when a request  for information is  made to a  particular
          name space or domain of resposibility.)

     o    category is a method of defining seperate sub-name spaces  within
          a particular domain.

     o    name is the actual official name of the product in question, and

     o    version_major and version_minor reference a particular version of
          a unique product.  If the version is left off of the information
          request, the request is assumed to refer to the 'current' or most
          recent version of the product.

Comments:
--------

     The most important  issue addressed  in this  document has  to be  the
requirement of the current Internet community that individual  intellectual
properties be uniquely identifiable and that multiple instances of the same
product be indentifiable as such.    Without this capability, the  Internet
will continue to labor under the limitation that the user is unable to make
appropriate  retrieval  decisions,  and  will  continue  to  use  bandwidth
needlessly.  An example of this is the current assumption that two files on
the Internet  are  exactly the  same,  based on  the  implicit  information
carried in their names.  (foo.tar.Z and bar.arc *might* represent the exact
same information and the user has no method of telling.)

     While  there  is  considerable  work   being  done  to  identify   the
characteristics of "Intellectual Properties",  the author takes the  stance
that the whole concept of intellectual property is a legal construction  to
protect the rights of the author.

     Intellectual properties do not exist except as the right or license to
create products.  The owner of  an intellectual property is not making  the
property itself available by  publishing it on the  network.  The owner  or
the owner's agent  is making  products available  which are  based on  this
property.

     As such, whether or not a particular file or resource on the net is or
is not an intellectual property is not relevant to the issues presented  in
this paper.  

     Once a publisher makes one or more products available on the  network,
it is the  publisher's decision  whether or  not one  product differs  from
another, and any attempt to formalize this characteristic farther than this
is not useful to the task at hand.

     The other issue is the fact that there are a number of characteristics
of a  particular product which are required to make the retrieval decision.
If the file is encoded in Postscript(tm) and the local system does not have
the required technology  to render that  file, any retrieval  of that  file
would be in vain.   The assumption  that all the  important details can  be
implied from the filename is a  very inapproprate one, based on the  simple
fact that various systems have differing  methods of naming the same  file.
A Unix server  might  represent the file as  foo.tar.Z, while a DOS  system
might conceivably name the  same file 'footar.arc', or  a VMS system  might
name the same file 'foo_tar.Z,123'

Uniform Resource Modifier

In this paper, the author proposes a method for encoding information concerning
the content and/or format of a network resource in the context of the URI 
method of naming and locating resources.

1: Introduction

A Uniform Resource Modifier (URM) is a way of encoding what is called a 
resource's metainformation [1-Weider 93].  This includes information such as 
the authors name, the resources data format, and its expiration date.  

2: Motivation

This paper was needed to separate the function of content/format specification 
of a resource from it's location and naming functions.  The naming function is 
taken care of by the Uniform Resource Name (URN) [3-Weider 93].  It's purpose 
is to uniquely name a resource.  The location function is handled by the 
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) [Berners-Lee 1993].  It's purpose is to actually 
gain access to the resource.  Neither of these items gives the user any clues 
as to the size, format, content, etc of the resource.  These are vital pieces 
of information that are contained outside of the resource itself.

The Uniform Resource Modifier (URM) is a method for encoding this 
meta-information in a way that will work together with the URL/URN encoding 
schemes.  It is designed to be extensible and flexible since many methods 
could be developed for representing meta-information.

3: The Uniform Resource Modifier (URM)

3.1 Functionality

The URM is designed to provide for a non-persistent meta-information encoding 
scheme.  It is meant to be used in conjunction with items called 
transponders [1-Weider 1993] and other network resources that need typing 
information.  URMs are meant to be used specifically in conjunction with URLs 
as a locally cached entity that is used to give typing information to network 
clients.  URMs are NOT persistent and may change.  They are meant to be human 
readable as well as machine readable.  This means that certain fields can have 
specific internal syntax but that this internal syntax is not to be defined 
here and is not required.  This allows for machine readable data to co-exist 
beside human readable data.

3.2 URM Sections Explanation

A URM (like URLs and URNs) have distinct sections to them: the wrapper, the 
encoding format scheme, and the list of encoded items.  The syntax is:

URM:Format_Scheme::"Data_Item"::"Data_Item"::...::"Data_Item":::

3.2.1 The wrapper

The wrapper consists of the 4 character header "URM:" and the 3 trailing colons.
These give separation from other Resource Identifiers and follows the convention
of URLs and URNs.  This also allows all three identifiers to be encoded into an
easily manipulated template.  This template is a subject for further 
investigation.

3.2.2 The Format_Scheme

The Format_Scheme is made of of three fields: the Format, language, and character set specifiers.  Their format is:

Format:language.character_set

Format is a single identifier that is made up of allowed meta-information 
encoding schemes.  Recognizing that other encoding schemes exist but that too 
many encoding schemes renders a URM useless it is suggested that a very 
limited number of encoding schemes be allowed and that those allowed be 
registered with the IANA.  This is for discussion among the IIIR working 
groups [2-Weider] .  This paper puts forth one as a good solution to most 
encoding problems.

The IAFA working group of the IETF has developed a very large list of field 
names and allowed data elements that are used to describe the various 
attributes of an item on an FTP site.  This list is comprehensive enough to be 
used as a URM encoding scheme.  This paper suggests that the identifier 
string 'IAFA' be used as a Format_Scheme.

Language specifies which language the resulting encoded information is in.  
This is specified in the standard format using ISO 639 country and ISO 3316 
language codes.  The format is:

languagecode_countrycode 

For example, British English would be represented as: 

en_UK

Character_set should be the ISO name for each allowed character set.

An example would be:

IAFA:en_US.iso88591

3.2.3 The list of encoded items

The list consists of one or more data items surrounded by quotation marks and 
separated by double colons.  This is the section where the actual data is 
encoded.  White space of any type is allowed here.  If quotation marks are 
needed within these items then they should be quoted with a '\' in the C style 
of special character quoting.  It should be noted that some transport
protocols put restrictions on white space and non-printable characters.  These 
should be taken into account when transporting URMs around the net.

An example follows:

URM:IAFA:en_US.iso88591::" Author: John Doe "::"
Title: \"My Book\"
"::"
Format: PostScript
":::

(Note the Carriage Return at the beginning and end of some fields.  This is 
simply an illustration of the inclusion of non-printable characters.)


4.  Syntax Specifics

Below is a BNF like syntax for a URM.  Where spaces are allowed they are listed 
in addition to other characters.  Square brackets '[' and ']' are used to 
indicate optional parts.  Single letters and digits stand for themselves.  All 
words of more than one letter are either expanded further in the syntax or 
represent themselves.

urm             URM:Format_Scheme::Item[::Items]:::
Format_Scheme   Format:Language:Character_Set
Format          alphas
Language        isoLanguageCode_isoCountryCode
isoLanguageCode alphas
isoCountryCode   alphas
Character_Set   alphas
Items           Item [Items]
Item            "xalphas"
alphas          alpha[alphas]
xalphas         xalpha[xalpha]
xalpha          alpha[:]
alpha           any character defined in any iso recognized character set
                except for a ':'

Plexus is an HTTP server written in perl (originally from cs.indiana.edu).
It's efficent because it handles it's own socket connections and most
requests are handled internally to the server itself (as opposed to exec'ing
external programs though that can be done if you need).  This means that most
requests requires only a single fork() to process.

Plexus supports HTTP/1.0 (though I only implement GET it would be easy to
add other request methods as needed).  It also now has the ability to
do format conversion (though real format negitiation is still not in yet).
As browsers support more HTTP/1.0 functions I'll be extended Plexus.

2.2 is really a working release, I expect there to be a 2.3 release before
too long to fix all the bugs I probably introduced in 2.2.  Hopefully,
things have settled down now so future release will just extend
functionality and fix bugs (instead of a redesign each time :-)
Several people are working on extended functionality, in 2.2 there is
a contributed extension called archiplex.pl, and I hope to add more
in the future (someone is working on secure access and another person
is doing a texinfo converter).

You can get plexus via anon ftp to austin.bsdi.com in pub/Plexus-2.2.tar.Z
It's also available from http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/plexus.html

comments/suggestions/improvements are welcome

>>>>> changes <<<<<<

Lots of changes, notably there were a couple of security holes I introduced
into get.pl that are plugged.  Most of the other changes are listed below.

Changes to Plexus from Previous Versions
========================================

Plexus 2.2
----------

* easier to customize install directories
* removed the crusty account.pl, I think someone is working on patches
  to do this right.
* converted everything to use pacakges
* some security holes patched with .. and invalid requests in get.pl
  Thanks to Mitchell N Charity <mcharity@lcs.mit.edu>
* added support for document translation (lots of changes in dir.pl)
* added setext.pl to convert from setext (.etx) to HTML
* added better image decoding support thanks to Chris McRae
  <mcrae@ckm.ucsf.edu>.  You can now specify image decoding
  in a configuration file ($MAP_CONFIG_FILE) and you can use
  bitmasks or rectangles.  In most cases you don't have to write
  any code!  Things like bookmark are more complicated and still
  require code, but few things really need that.
* &send_file went away and was replaced with: &wrap_file, &wrap_fd,
  &raw_file, &raw_fd.   &require is certainly the only stable
  interface at this point (though I don't see &raw_fd changing again).
  &wrap_* will probably have to change again to make file translations
  work "right".
* added support for hypertext'ed man pages from pre-formatted files.
  In this initial release they are specific to bsdi man pages
  but should be easy to configure for your local system (most of the
  config options are at the top of the bsdi-man.pl file).
* added some log file summerizing scripts

Subject: A new WWW server for botanical and biodiversity information
Date: Thu, 8 Jul 1993 12:55:45 +1000 (EST)

Greetings

I could not find a place to formally register a WWW server so I am
sending you this announcement.  I would be pleased if you could do what
has to be done to register this server, advertise its presence and
otherwise entangle it in the Web.

At the Gardens we have an FDDI compliant network of over 30 Sun
sparcstations, 8 macs, 25 pcs, 12 dumb terminals, etc. and  an
associated Novell network on site has about 24 pcs.

A major activity centres on a large botanical database on the Oracle
RDBMS.  We developed a gopher interface to parts of this database and
plan to do provide similar information with WWW.  We have a large
collection of scientifically vouched 35mm slides of Australian native
plants that we plan to digitize and make available through WWW as soon
as we come to grips with the most appropriate file formats.

All of the sparc stations have access to Xmosaic and WWW, which staff are
starting to use.  Dumb terminals are using the line oriented WWW clinet
until we can sort out the VT-100 versions.  They have been using gopher
for quite a while and are comfortable with using the network and the
menu-like hierachy - our task now is to educate them about the hypertext
view of the same information.  Those that have tried it like the Xmosaic
interface - it handles gopher so well we are thinking of using it as our
gopher client of choice.

kind regards

Jim Croft

        +---------------------------------------------------------+

The Australian National Botanic Gardens is pleased to offer a new
World Wide Web server for biodiversity information which has just
been commissioned and released to the Internet.

It has yet to be registered on any of the major WWW sites but can be
picked up from the ANU WWW server at life.anu.edu.au port 80.

The ANBG WWW server can be found at 155.187.10.12 port 80 and there are
two files, index.html and anbg.html, that point to a number of other
files and network information services.  The URLs (Universal Record
Locators ) for these files are:

     http://155.187.10.12:80/index.html
     http://155.187.10.12:80/anbg.html

The former is a terse home page with links to other network resources,
the later is a more narrative account leading to a range of other files
and information servers, essentially a verbose form of the former.

WWW is a hypertext client/server network information retrieval tool
based on linked marked up documents.  Clients exist for a range of
operating environments to allow storage and display of formatted text,
in-line images, sounds, etc.  WWW clients can access gopher, ftp, wais,
news sites and invoke telnet sessions, etc.

If you are not running a local WWW client (like xmosaic, cello, etc.)
public WWW clients (line oriented and screen-oriented vt-100-like) are
available from a number of places and can be picked up from the ANBG
gopher (155.187.10.12 port 70) under Other Information Servers.

The focus of the ANBG WWW server is the same as that of the ANBG
biodiversity gopher and in fact has links to all of the ANBG gopher
resources, including the on-line database access and the WAIS indices.
Botanical and biodiversity documents will be marked up and attached to
this server on a regular basis.

With the new ability to integrate text and images, the ANBG will be
making an effort to provide renderings of some of its slide collection
to the network at various resolutions, depending on available disk
space.  Some trial images are available, but files formats are still
being assessed.

As the ANBG WWW resource is still under consruction, it is possible
that the lower level WWW directory structure may change.  For the
time being users are encouraged to limit their links to the two URLs
listed aboove.

For information about the ANBG network information services, send email
requests to:

     webmaster@anbg.gov.au      World Wide Web
     gophermaster@anbg.gov.au   Gopher
     postmaster@anbg.gov.au     Email

Status: RO

I liked Marc's suggestions for <LI IMG=...> and will add it to the
proposed Internet Draft for HTML+ so that you guys can pick over it
at the workshop, unfortunately, I can't come :-(.

The discussion about "built-in" bitmaps seems to have forgotten URNs.
By designating the common bullets/icons as URNs it all becomes a mere
matter of caching strategy.

The URN mechanism provides a protocol for resolving a URN to the nearest
available URL, similar I guess to the domain name service for host names.
By making the local URN name server cooperate with a local HTTP server,
frequently requested URNs will be served directly from the local cache.
The cache management strategy doesn't have to be completely automatic,
and you could designate some objects to be cached using a config file.

For red-hot performance, the first point of access for the URN name service
would be a permanently loaded process on your own machine (avoiding inetd
fork/exec delay), with objects in the local cache being accessed directly
as files.

HTML+ goes along with (4). The format is presentation independent, but
does allow authors to include hints, which may be ignored by the browser.
This will be made clear in the proposed Internet Draft, that I will 
"post" in a couple of days time.

	setenv WWW_gopher_GATEWAY	gw.here.com
	
setting it separately for each type of URL.
They then use http to go to the gateway, which returns
whatever document/search it was they wanted.

The client can in fact run with a rule file instead of
the environment variables,
which allows more complicated selections to be set up.

The CERN WWW server (httpd) will run as a gateway
just by being configured correctly. The config
file needs lines like for example

	pass	http:*
	pass	wais:*
	pass	gopher:*
	fail	news:alt.*
	pass	news:*

The gateway can at the same time be a server
for files, by putting in lines like

	pass	http://gw.here.com/*	file:/pub/*
	pass	/*			file:/pub/*

There are lots of alternatives.	
It all comes out in the wash if the system is
sufficiently modular in the first place.

Subject: URLs and "routing" information
From: Markus Stumpf <stumpf@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

Hello!

We have a workstation cluster, where all the students of the first  
year
are put on. They have full email and USENET news access, but no  
online
services such as ftp, telnet, www, gopher, etc. (no default routes on
these machines) outside the campus net.

I have just taken a look at go4gw and I think the idea behind is
rather good.
As I understood it (it was a short look) it rewrites the addresses of
the gopher objects, so that the host is always the gateway server and
the real host becomes part of the object-path.

I think it would be a good idea to have this kind of routing in URLs,  
too!
It would then be rather simple to write gateway servers to other
services which may not be accessible directly or to write servers to  
sit
on firewalls.

Would this be possible?

Ciao

Folks:

Because of the potential for significant abuse of our licensing
agreement with Distinct Corporation, we will no longer be distributing
their runtime stack via the Net.  

Where does this leave us?

Distribution-wise:

Individuals at academic institutions within the United States will
still be able to obtain copies of DIS.ZIP (containing the Distinct
stack) by sending a FAXed request on appropriate letterhead to the
Legal Information Institute at 607-255-7193.  We will honor these
requests as quickly as we can, giving priority to those who represent
large numbers of other users, such as testers within campus computing
organizations. Others are free to order the Distinct stack directly
from Distinct Corporation, mktg@distinct.com.

HOWEVER, you should be aware of the following:

Yesterday, at the time Distinct communicated with us, we were on the
verge of announcing the release of a stable version 1.0 of Cello.
While we expect that minor bugs remain, it was in our opinion
sufficiently beaten-on to go into a full-fledged release.  We have
decided to withhold that release for approximately three to four weeks
until it can be made WINSOCK-compliant.  This should be good news for
those of you running multiple stacks -- who seem, at least from the
mail we've received, to be the majority of beta-Cellists.  It will also
permit you considerable freedom of choice in where you ultimately shop
for your TCP/IP stack.

In general, we counsel patience and would prefer that you refrain
from sending us FAXed requests unless you absolutely MUST have the
software within the intervening few weeks.  Please be aware that we
are a VERY small shop -- not the "development team" that many of you
have sent mail to -- and time spent mailing out disks is, to a
surprising degree,  time taken
away from software development.  So please be patient; we
will have a new version as quickly as we can.

We very much regret this delay, and hope that it won't ultimately
inhibit your use of Cello -- which we have a certain amount of pride
in and hope is working well for you.

Regards,
Tb.

Subject:  WWWLIB for VMS

Hello,

I have great troubles in Installing the WWWLIB Version 2.09 and also the
WWWDaemon_2.07 on A VMS machine.

The daemon always return error code 500 - Unable to access document.
The client also does not manage to access document.

Did anyone had any luck in installing the latest WWWLIB on VMS machine or has a
clue of the source of this problems.

I think that for some reason the URL is not translated to VMS format but I
couldn't find the solution.

Thanks

Is it still acceptable for those of in in the computing organizations

I'm not quite clear on whether or not to use a URL:
	wais://cmns-moon.think.com:210/WWP
or
	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001/cmns-moon.think.com:210/WWP

Many people report errors when the wais: URL is used, but I would think
it'd be better to use that and let each client use the best WAIS gateway
available than to always direct them to one site (that is probably already
heavily enough trafficked)

Advice?
thanks,
	Joe

Folks:

I'm happy to report that Distinct Corporation called this afternoon
and expressed their willingness to make available a 60-day evaluation
copy of their runtime stack which we will be able to distribute
without constraints.

The catch is that it will not be available until next Wednesday or so,
when they've had a chance to prepare it and we've had a chance to
mount it on the FTP site; the LII is moving lock stock and barrel to
Boston this week for the AALL meetings.

The arrangements for distribution to US academic institutions remain
unaltered, and you should contact us via FAX to make arrangements as
outlined in the previous message.  Likewise, we will continue
accelerated development of a WINSOCK version.

Regards,
Tb.

I have found at least one site, 
(http://heplibw3.slac.stanford.edu.:80/FIND/hep the SLAC SPIRES database),
which doesn't seem to like the searching routines of the 2.9 version of
the WWW Library.

The search always returns with no result and the title of the document
is severely mangled.  The title looks like:
sho indexes HTTP/1.0 Accept: text/plain Accept: text/html Accept: image/jpeg...

from a search string "sho indexes".

It appears that the extra "HTTP/1.0" and "Accept" statements are causing
the slac server problems.  Is this a problem that will be widespread?
Or should I just tell SLAC about it and forget it?

Mosaic is, so far as I can tell, completely busted wrt wais: url
support (and the associated gateway environment variable).  I haven't
tracked this down as it will be irrelevant with the coming (real soon
now) native WAIS support under libwww2.

Subject: Organizing gophers
Date: Fri, 9 Jul 93 17:27:31 EST

I wrote the following comments in response to a query on 
another list. However I thought that subscribers to  NIR 
may also find this of some interest, as it reflects some 
of my experiences in the "front lines" of network information. 

It's unfortunate that discussions of network information 
tend to focus almost exclusively on hardware and software. 
The issues involved in actually organizing the information 
are just as great, and are rapdily becoming more critical 
as the user base of Gopher, WWW etc expands.

A  number of us who run gopher services have been thinking about 
this problem for a long time now. While the number of servers, and 
the amount of information, is relatively small the problem is not 
too bad. Most managers have adopted much the same approach as I 
have, namely create a list of "other sites", so that people can 
explore for themselves. 

However this approach soon bogs down because most sites provide 
information on a variety of topics, so it can take users a long 
time to sift the "wheat from the chaff". The following are the 
steps that I have taken in order to help users: 

1. I've tried to place the infromation that users really want as 
   close as possible to the top level menu. Hence I provide a 
   series of thematic menu options on subjects that I try to 
   support, e.g. biodiversity, landscape ecology, molecular
   biology, ...

2. I've tried to build some redundancy into the system by 
   providing alternative paths to the same information. 
   e.g. the path ~/biodiversity/other_sites leads to the  
        same information as ~/other_sites/biodiversity. 

3. Instead of just providing pointers to "other sites", I 
   also try to "pick the eyes" out of each site by providing 
   direct pointers to useful information at those sites. 
   An extreme case of this is my medical folder - I maintain 
   almost no relevant data locally at all (except virus taxa
   database), but have collated a series of pointers to major 
   databases. 
   
   This may sound parasitic to some of you, but it serves some 
   very basic, but important functions: 
   (a) information is maintained at its source; 
   (b) collating live pointers to services, not just sites, 
       is an EXTREMELY helpful indexing service for users. 
   (c) it helps draw attention to sites that may be overlooked 
       otherwise - users tend to go back to the "big" sites again 
       and again. 
   (d) There's mountains of material out there. No single site 
       can hold everything, as many are now discovering. 
   
   In my view is that there is at present far too little of this 
   sort of sifting network information. Obviously the sifting 
   requires a lot of effort by the system manager. However users
   should realize that an important contribution they can make is 
   to compile "live" lists of links around specialist themes. All 
   you have to do is compile a host of bookmarks. There are lots 
   of newsgroup FAQs about, but very few of us seem to be compiling 
   this sort of information into live links. Many would see that 
   this sort of activity is irrelevant, given the power of Veronica 
   searches, but as with "other sites", veronica searches take a 
   long time to sift through. 

   I would be very happy to hear from users who have compiled 
   live links information and would be happy to create some 
   specialist folders out of such material. 

   The main difficulties with this approach are that servers often 
   reorganize, or delete material without notice, so links sometimes 
   become dead without warning. Also, as network traffic increases 
   the need to "mirror" rather than merely provide pointers becomes 
   more important. For example, I pull down weather images for various 
   parts of the world each day, so that (Australian) users won't be 
   continually transferring satellite images across the Pacific. 
   Here automation is the key - a few cron scripts go a long way!
   
4. The next stage beyond (3) is to develop coordinating projects for 
   specialist themes. My idea is that sites willing to provide 
   support for a particular topic become "nodes" in a thematic 
   information network. Here "support" means (a) maintain on-line 
   information; (b) accept contributions from users; (c) coordinate 
   with other nodes. My first experiment with this approach is 
   "FireNet", which we hope will grow into a world-wide information
   network for everyone interested in landscape fires. I am 
   currently developing material for other such themes, including 
   palynology, viruses, and complex systems. 
   
   The principle is that the information stored at all nodes in a 
   thematic network becomes a truly distributed information system. 
   Each node would provide pointers, or mirrors, for information 
   on other nodes. Moreover the directory/menu structure should be 
   consistent across all nodes in the system. Other sites can, of 
   course, provide access to the system simply by pointing at one 
   of the nodes. 

5. The above issues become even more critical as we move beyond 
   gopher to hypermedia information stored under World Wide Web. 
   Here I have adopted the principle of providing "home pages" 
   for each topic that I support. Thus I have home pages for 
   biodiversity, FireNet, pollen, weather and global change, 
   Landscapes, etc to parallel the gopher menus. These include 
   gopher links, of course, but also pointers to other hypertext 
   documents. Again the key is to provide lots of thematic trails 
   through all the documents you provide. 

Finally, I should say that I see myself very much in the role of 
network publisher. Indeed I am now literally obtaining ISBN and ISSN 
codes for some of the material that I place on the system. It's 
important that the user community come to recognize this and act 
accordingly. i.e. instead of being passive users, they should look 
at what they can contribute. Those of us who are trying to maintain 
systems cannot do the job on our own - it's intensely annoying to 
receive complaints of the kind "your info. is out of date" or 
"why aren't you providing ...". As the scale of the system becomes 
some user's need to play a far bigger role than they have to date. 

I hope that your readers will find the above comments of interest. 
I attach below contact details for my Bioinformatics information 
service for anyone interested.

Subject: Annotation support
Status: RO

Support for Annotations is not (as far as I know) part of the current HTML standard, since
   it is not really a property of the source text, but rather of the Browser. I notice that
   NCSA's Mosaic is currently providing private annotations, and is about to provide group
   and public annotations. This is a good idea, although the annotations are on a "per Window"
   basis, which may not be ideal - it could be better if the annotations are linked more closely
   to sections of text - perhaps by having "annotation anchors" in the margin, which link 
   to the annotation text

   There is an additional problem with annotations, not addressed in Mosaic's implementation, since
   it may be desirable to allow annotations on annotations! I do not believe that Mosaic does this.

I am aware of some systems which provide support for annotations, though not for HTML documents - 
   for example the MUCH system developed by Roy Rada at Liverpool, and designed for asynchronous local
   development of text, does have annotation support.

However, although it might appear that annotations are "simply" a property of the Browser - the
   problem does not end there. The way NCSA have done it is to provide annotation servers - this then
   raises the possibility of different Browsers using the same annotation server. This would be
   beneficial to many users, since there would then be no requirement to adopt a particular browser
   package - for example I could communicate using Mosaic on my Unix system, and someone else could
   annotate my text using Cello on an IBM PC etc. 

It seems to me that there is a need for consideration of annotation services, and how to provide them.

I think this is an issue which needs wider discussion - if it has not had it already.

  Personally, I like the way that Xmosaic does annotations.  They are
clearly marked off from the main body of the document, and easy to
add to documents.  (one thing lacking is support for an external
editor of some type - Marc?)

  I just finished adding the group annotation support to my emacs
browser last night - was pretty trivial.  And it wouldn't be hard at
all to support multiple servers using different protocols.  Should
there be some sort of function HTMakeAnno(url,type,...)?

   I'm pretty sure it will allow annotations on annotations on
annotations.  The group annotations are just URLS, and the server
(according to Marc Andreesen) does no checking/manipulation of the
urls before fetching the annotation.  (Which means http://somehost:80/
is different that http://somehost/, but I think all browsers should
send a fully qualified URL anyway, but thats just my 2 cents)

   I've strived to maintain compatibility with xmosaic in any way I
can think of with my emacs browser.  Supports the mosaic hotlists,
global history, and just recently the group annotations (and am
working on the private annotations).  I think all the browser
developers should do this.  Xmosaic is the best of the browsers in
most respects, and there should definitely be compatibility between
the browsers.  Would be stupid of me to put annotation support into my
emacs browser, when only the other 100 or so people using it would be
able to see them.  Remember: _WORLD WIDE_ web. :)

   I'm hoping it will be on the table for discussion at the W^5.

This was in error - I have checked and Mosaic does indeed do annotations on 
annotations.

What I would now like to be able to do is to see the annotations all on the
screen at the same time - this would presumably be possible if I can see
the annotations in separate windows - I normally run Mosaic in single window mode -
is there a way to selectively permit some pages to have their own windows at
run time?

I think the other issues I raised are still relevant.

The (unrecognised or incorrect) command used was 'ANN_GET'.

I can wait if the service isn't running yet, but if it is, then

See
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/group-annotations.html
for full info -- you're probably trying to connect to hoohoo's port 80
server rather than the port 8001 annotation server... do this:

XMosaic*annotationServer: hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001

...and it should work.

Yup.  The URL (and, in the future, URN) mechanism provides a
convenient infrastructure for cleanly layering annotations on top of
documents at any of several virtual levels, and we're exploiting it.

Absolutely.  The reason we don't do this yet is this -- how do we
track position in a text document that (a) we have no control over and
(b) could change in any way at any time?  I don't have any answers
yet, so I'm not sure how to work it...

(If we don't come up with anything better, ultimately Mosaic will use
a combination of character position plus some amount of textual
context, with a fallback mechanism to drop "detached" annotations to
the bottom of the document with clear notification that this has
happened.)

The same mechanism, whatever it is, will also be used to support

Yup, and in fact Bill Perry is currently adding annotation support to
his w3.el Emacs client, and Mac and Windows Mosaic will have
annotation server support (it's already working under Windows, as a
matter of fact, so I can *guarantee* that :-).

Absolutely!  I'm looking forward to hearing what you and others have
to say.  The current system is only a prototype, and we are absolutely
open to suggestions (or completely redesigns).  See
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Notes/group-annotation-issues.html
for a few notes I've typed up...

Comments on Rob Raisch's proposed REGISTRAR for URNs.

Rob, this is a clear presentation of the issues.  I have
a few nits and a few strategic questions.


Nits:

Your definition of an Instance doesn't quite allow it to be the
result of a query that might have differing results (assuming
the server knows where I am, I could say, "send me the
addresses of all the bookstores in my area that carry ORA books").
I think "indistinguishable" is unneeded:  the owner says they're
the same (for the purposes at hand) and that's good enough.

You say that "the actual content of a URN is that to which it
refers," which doesn't make a lot of sense when taken literally.
What's your thought here?

Your concluding discussion of intellectual property, while 
relevant to Internet publishing and URNs, doesn't seem necessary in
connection with Registrar, which is a concrete proposal for
making URNs work.


Strategic Questions:

URNs may never be destroyed, yet I might want to give URNs to 
every chunk of every section of every book in every series we publish, 
for all editions.  (Is that right?)  So a whole lot of URNs are 
going to build up, and quickly, too.  How would you figure out
when to delist a URN?  Wouldn't the number of URNs eventually
make it slower to use Registrar than to try some URLs in the
first place?  This is a general issue with URNs, not specific
to Registrar.

The amount of info you require for the URN Record Format is
considerable.  Is it all needed?  On a related point, why should
Registrar support querying for CREATOR?  If you are an individual
who just wants to put some stuff online, you are likely not to
bother with registering your URN if it's this much work.  Is that
a bug or a feature?

Regards,

I remember someone posting a while ago about adding the mailto: url to
their browser and the syntax they were going to use.  I think this
would be a good addition.

What was the format this person decided on?  I'd like to put it in my
emacs browser, and don't want to flub the syntax. :)

Thanks for any info,

	That kind of request, "...in my area...", is implicit in this
whole thing.  The idea is that any request is answered by the registrar
with a list of responses which are ordered according to their
'appropriateness' in terms of retrieval.  This is not a general directory
service.  It is a service which provides enough information to make the
best retrieval decision.

> What's your thought here?

	The URN itself contains no information whatsoever.  The URN is
simply a label and carries no semantic value.  The fact that you can read
this kind of URN is an artifact of its composition and until we can get
away from passing around URNs as human-readable text, there is some value
in making them human readable.  This will not be the case in the future.

	Well, this is an area of some debate.  My proposal that URNs refer
to products and not to property is not in line with much of the thinking
which has gone into this whole area.  I felt that there would be value in
explaining my proposal from the standpoint of the general discussion and
lay some context to understand what I was talking about.

	There is no such thing as 'delisting' a URN.  URNs are forever. 
Unless you intend on selling a chunk of a section of a book of a series,
there is no value in registering a URN for each chunk.  With efficient
indexing, slowness of retrieval is not an issue.  Yes, there will be a
proliferation of URNs, that is life.  There is a proliferation of human
names, social security numbers and registration of stars in the heavens.
What's your point?  <smile>

	This is a proposal which meets our immediate needs as publishers,
and offers flexibility for others.  I threw in things I thought would be
of value.  The template is not written in stone.  There are other
efforts that define templates for information, (IAFA.)  What
information would *YOU* like to see here? 

	Thanks for the comments.

I'm just trying to figure it all out.  I imagined a simple set of
pairs of strings, URNs and URLs.  

If I have a large hierarchical set of files (a chunked book), do
I have to give each chunk a URN for this system to be useful?
Would it be possible to give a URN for the top-level file in
the set, as determined by GROUP attributes?

It's okay with me if a lot of info is required to register with
Register.  An HTML FORM would be useful as a front end.

This shouldn't be right -- if it were that easy, there'd be no benefit
in having URNs :).  I imagined it would be something like

URN -> list of URLs and some kind of grading function

> If I have a large hierarchical set of files (a chunked book), do I

Would it be sensible to give the book a URN, and then assume each
copy is the same, so you can use a URL like
	(dereference URN to get URL)#chunk
?

Yours in equal perplexity :)

Nat, and everyone...

	I really tried to make registrar easy to understand.  It seems I
failed.  ANY questions whatsoever, please please please ask.

	I really believe that this is one of the most important issues we
have on the network today, (second only perhaps to the exhaustion of the
address space.)  

	If we cannot distribute information in an efficient fashion, as
the network grows the only answer we have to handle the increased need for
retrieval is to deploy bigger pipes.  While this is (generally) a good
thing, it swiftly becomes unmanagable.  All of this based on the fact that
we have no way to know that the file we need is on the next machine down
the line (virtually.) 

	Consider a million PDAs (Personal Data Assistants) all trying to
retrieve the same X-rated GIF of Tori Spelling or Luke Perry (never seen
it, I asked. ;) all from the same repository.  Melting the wires becomes
an understatement of epic proportions.

It does look clearer on a second reading, I promise :).  Once you get
through the definitions, it all makes sense.  For this to take off,
though:

  -- someone will have to register a lot of information
  -- some programs will have to use it

What is the state of play in both of these?  (I sincerely hope that
WWW browsers will be part of the second category :-)

	After we(*) decide on the final form, ORA will register many of
the products we will be providing via the Internet in registrar, and there
are other documents (like the hundreds of thousands of Federal Register
docs) which will prove the concepts.  (*= we in this context is the WWW,
Gopher, URI, and com-priv world and anyone else who is interested in
participating.)

Status: RO


Rob, I think you made things clear enough; it's just more complicated
than we had imagined, maybe necessarily so.

But there's still a problem with the number of URNs.  The UC Berkeley
library has 8 million volumes.  Say each of those vols has 1,000
paras, and each para gets a URN.  That's 8 billion URNs.  Can a
server system deal with that volume?  In a nutshell, does this
idea of URNs scale?

I don't have any objections to Registrar as an implementation of
URNs; I'm just trying to see how I would use it and what happens
as it develops.

  Why would you need to give each para a URN? Just specify the URN of the
book/resource and give some kind of agreed upon byte count range as what
exactly you are talking about. Now if this resource gets used a lot and
becomes more of a resource by itself then you could give that specific
URN+byte count it's own corresponding unique URN. Why you would want to
is a topic for discussion but I could see the need arising.

  For example, say I wanted to talk about the 2nd Ammendment to the U.S.
constitution directly I would talk about:

URN:Auth_ID:Consitution.Ammendments
URM:IAFA:en_US.iso88591::"ByteRange:323-450":::

(Note: Rob has pointed out that you really don't need the last 3 colons.
I'm probably going to take them out.)

It was

Anyone see any problems with that?

Note: smart browers could use the SMTP "VRFY" function to get

I'll try to remember to bring it up at the URI BOFs today at the IETF.

This is a little more complicated than it sounds.  First, the browser
must determine that SMTP is the delivery method that will be used for
that address, which is not necessarily anywhere accessible.  Once you
know it's SMTP, you need to use DNS to look for MX records that point
to the preferred delivery site, where you can use VRFY.

In most cases this can be reduced to a VRFY @site.dom.org, but it's
those exceptions that will get you....

Good idea! It brings ISINDEX into line with the FORM tag.

   Anyone see any problems with that?

How should characters legal in RFC822 mail addresses but not in URLs be
handled?  That is, how do we deal with "Erik Ostrom"@foo.bar.baz.com?  Or do
we just proclaim that addresses containing unpopular characters deserve to
lose?

I think %-quoting (and unquoting in the browser, this is important) is an
obvious answer, but I'd like to have some kind of official agreement on how to
deal with this.

P.S. And what about Gopher URLs?  Anyone else care about making implementation
and spec match up?  It's just a / away...

Thanks for all the hard work you have put in on URN's. I too think
it is really important for the future of the net.

I imagine people wanting to include a URN in hypertext links together
with attributes that influence how it is resolved to a URL, e.g. by stating
acceptable formats, or size limits (one might want to select a low resolution
copy of an image or movie).

Can you explain how the protocol can carry such attributes. Also we will need
to generalise the syntax for hrefs in HTML/HTML+ to allow such hints
to be encoded, e.g. using a semicolon as a separator:

        "URN;attr1=val1;attr2;attr3=val3"

The alternative is for the name service to return a list of URLs together
with their properties leaving the client to select the most appropriate one.

URNs seem a good solution to standard bitmaps etc. with local caching of
small/commonly accessed objects. I would like to access the URN name
resolution service in such a way that it works very efficiently for local
copies on my machine. The service calls would ripple up through local
servers, to the wider net.

I assume the name resolution service is based on datagrams (UDP)? 
If so, this places practical limits on how much information can be shipped
in each direction. Sending constraints and letting the name service select
a URL is then better than returning an unbounded list of alternatives.

Perhaps it should run continously, rather than being invoked by inetd.
This would ensure a rapid response for local files.

Lynx Ver. 2.0.10 is now available for anonymous ftp from
 FTP2.cc.ukans.edu    as   /pub/lynx/lynx2-0-10.tar.Z

( ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx/lynx2-0-10.tar.Z )

 *NOTE: This is a new ftp site.
	The old ftp site (acs220) is no longer valid.
	Ftp2.cc.ukans.edu will be the new PERMANENT ftp
	site!  Acs220 will carry a README file explaining
	the new site information for a period of at least
	two to three weeks.

Lynx is a distributed hypertext browser with full World Wide Web
capibilities.  For an explanation of features and a demo, telnet
to "kufacts.cc.ukans.edu" and login as "www".

This release of Lynx has been compiled by me on the following platforms:

 o  IBM (AIX 3.2)
 o  DEC (Ultrix, VMS)
 o  Sun 3 and 4
 o  NeXT (Mine is an older version of NeXTStep, but it should work 
         with newer ones too.)

Binaries for the following platforms are available:

 o  IBM (AIX 3.2, will work with 3.1 as well)
 o  Ultrix
 o  Sun 4
 o  VMS (for multinet)

A new listserv list has been created for the distribution of
Lynx related information and updates.
  o  Lynx-Dev@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu
 
Send a subscribe request to listserv@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu to
be added to the list.  All new releases will be anounced on this
list.

The following new features have been added:
  o  IMG tags are recognized and the word [IMAGE] appears in its place. 
        (not in VMS)
  o  "mailto:" URL's are now supported.
  o  Document owners can now be defined using the "link" tag.
	<link rev=made href="mailto:montulli@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu">
	will define me as the creator of the document.  When the 
	comment feature, the 'C' command in Lynx, is used, Lynx will 
	use the "href" value as the destination of the comment.   (not in VMS)
  o  Now uses the 2.9 version of the WWW Common Code Library. (not in VMS)
  o  Uses the full HTTP/1.0 protocol.
  o  The environment variable WWW_HOME is now recognized. 
  o  Updated search routines.
  o  WAIS support. (not in VMS, except gateway functions)
  o  Optional Emacs-style key definitions.
  o  Gopher Directory format has been changed to show verbose information
        by default, and the screen format has changed.
  o  'V' is now used to "View" the bookmark file.
  o  'G' is now used to "Go" to a random user specified URL.
  o  Tildas are removed from the first character of mail messages to
        prevent security holes in the UCB mailer.
  o  Installation has changed slightly to make the process easier.
	See the INSTALLATION file in the distribution.
  o  Support for ISO_LATIN1 entities.  At least in vt100 modes. (not in VMS)

* features followed by (not in VMS) are not currently available under VMS.  
  These features are dependent on the 2.X version of the WWW Library which
  has not yet been ported to VMS.

The following bugs have been fixed:
  o  Terminal handling under VMS is fixed.  
  o  Shells return to the original directory that Lynx was started in.  
  o  Socket closing problem under Multinet fixed.
  o  Fixed (added) VMS comment routines.
  o  Ctrl-R and Delete are now passed correctly under VMS.
  o  The VMS workings are significantly cleaner.
  o  Lots and Lots of other small and medium bugs that I didn't write down
        and now can't remember.

Thank You's:
  o  Foteos Macrides -- Foteos worked some very long hours with me and on
        his own improving Lynx.  He deserves complete credit for almost 
        all the VMS improvements and several other bug fixes.  
	(Macrides@sci.wfeb.edu)

  o  Thanks to all the people who contributed bug reports, fixes and 
        performed pre-release testing last week.  

As usual send bug-reports and comments to montulli@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu

Michael asks why you need to identify paragraphs within a document.
The US Consitution may be fairly stable (in an agreed English
version) so byte counts may be useful, but living documents
often have ids for bits of their contents so that you can
refer to them without having to go through the heuristics
"the bit about protocols 2/3 of the way down your message".
This is the classic "how do we make links to living documents"
question -- I think there is a summary of the
issues in

AS few decisions at yesterday's WG session (minutes will be out later)

1. The afs: URL type was removed from the spec due to lack of interest
   and because it had not been really discassued or thought out.

2. The mailto:mail@add.ress url was put in.

3. The practice of wrapping URLs within plain ASCII documents
    within <> (as is commonly done with mail addresses and news
    message IDs) was put in.

I personally hope that <> will also be used to wrap URNs in the same
way.  This will save the current rather messy practice of putting
buts of <a name=html>html</a> into plain text, and allow urls to be
used without a knowledge of HTML.

The discussions continue...

Yes Iguiess they should be %quoted.  Another possibility is that we
allow spaces and quotes etc in URLs.  This is sugested by about
50% of those with an opionion on the matter in the URI working
group (yesterday).  It will be discussed again tomorrow.

Hooray. Speaking as an AFS administrator, I always thought it rather
odd. I thought I mailed some comments on it to Tim BL, but maybe these
got lost in the post (UK mail is weird, all the more so because UK
mailers try to treat CERN as part of the UK). So, just to hammer the
nails in the coffin, I'll repeat my objections.

1) AFS sites access another AFS site's files simply by treating them as
local files, so the existing file: URL type deals with this. AFS sites
following the normal naming conventions simply share onw massive
"local" filesystem. The problem of exactly what file: refers to in
respect of the local system has been discussed elsewhere, but AFS
avoids this, as no file server name appears in the URL, except
conventionally as part of the filename, e.g.
file:/afs/pegasus.cranfield.ac.uk/home/cc/ccprl, NOT
file://pegasus.cranfield.ac.uk/home/cc/ccprl.

2) AFS sites are under no obligation to mount volumes consistently in
one place so that a particular pathname will always work. Though in
practise, most sites do, there are potential problems if an afs: URL
assumes that a set of files which haven't moved in AFS terms are
mounted in several different places in the AFS tree at once. Naive
applications will probably see several copies which mysteriously appear
and disappear. "Mounting" in AFS terms, can be done by anyone,
anywhere. One could make the contents of the afs: URL into an AFS
cell/volume pair and a relative filename, rather than a pathname, but I
can't honestly see any point.

3) AFS sites can only see other AFS sites via AFS. Fairly obvious, but
the point is that an AFS site wishing to publish information widely
will do so in other ways (anon ftp, http, etc). AFS is also restricted
to U**x clients, which rules out all PC people, even if they're at AFS sites.

4) AFS is not well suited for read-only access of freely published
material. Compared to http, there is a large overhead in terms of
authentication, authorization, cache maintenance and so on. These are
great for actively sharing files amongst a small group of people, but
vast overkill for most WWW stuff over the wide area. Read-only volumes
help a bit, but not much.

Just out of interest, who is using AFS in the www community?

Dave asks how one can specify particular pererences for
retrieval of an object in the link.  I don't think
this is information for the link.  In HTTP it is transferred
atthe time of retrieval from the server, the HTTP headers
containing information for stating prefernces for variants
(language, representation, encoding).

I thinkwork is needed on parameters to hte representations
like 
  image/gif
is all very well, but 
image/gif  height=200 width=400 colours=8
provides better information for the server, allowing it to
select or generate an image more accurately, and save bandwidth.

I would prefer something like

<IMG HREF="http://somenode/something/leftarrow-small" name="leftarrow-small">

The idea here would be to allow for the browser to first see if it has a built-in 
called "leftarrow-small", but if not to access the bitmap using the HREF in the 
standard way. 

This would have the advantages of allowing browsers to choose which bitmaps to 
support as built-ins, but to remain compatible with the rest of the world. 
Perhaps more importantly it would allow the list of "standard" bitmaps to be 
expanded easily without worry of breaking older version of browsers.

The document is frozen
For "frozen text documents" it might be wise to ignore white space, line
delimiters, and other control characters since the same document (a mail
message or news article) may appear to  be the same on different platforms
(Unix, Mac, DOS/Windows), but different line endings will be used, tabs
could be converted to spaces, etc. so it might be "safer" to refer to
character offsets that ignore white space. This would still allow a link to
a particular word, sentence, paragraph, etc.

On the other hand, link references to frozen documents could be made such
as "word 2 to 4 of sentence 5 of paragraph six" which would be the same on
all platforms if the terms "word", "line", "sentence", and "paragraph" are
defined. Apple uses this model in their text object model today. Many
modern scripting environments: AppleScript, HyperCard, ToolBook, MetaCard,
etc. also support this type of referencing.

Finally, references might be made to a word(s) or phrase(s) contained in a
document, so that the actual physical location of the link isn't determined
until the document is retrieved. Under this scenario, a browser also needs
to be able to find the next occurance within the document so that the user
sees all references, not just the first. A link reference by search
"phrase" works for formatted documents as well as straight text, so the
search method will work for Microsoft Word, RTF, WordPerfect, FrameMaker,
TeX, plain text, etc. versions of the same raw information, the search just
ignores formatting information. It doesn't matter if the document changes,
since no exact location offset references are made; the worst case is that
the search phrase is removed from the document so that the link is
effectively gone. An example of this kind of lookup is done by the On
Location software for the Macintosh; it maintains an index of all text on a
drive, but the index refers only to the document, not an exact location
within a document. On Location allows you to search for text "as is" as
well as the root of a word, so a link to "link" would match "links" or
"linking" if you wanted. I think this kind of link would fit in well with
the HTML+ specification.

I like the last approach, since it appears to work better with frozen
documents as well as documents with different versions. By referencing a
lookup word, phrase, etc. a browser or server can easily make a index of a
document as well as look for other documents that might be applicable. This
is one of those rare cases where the solution works well for the user and
the machine.

Ummmm... I think this is an important issue.  

URNs do not refer to living documents.  URNs refer to static products. 
Just as the URN is forever, the product to which it refers is forever, and
if there is some reason to change it, that change creates a new product.
If the product is for some reason no longer available, then the URN maps
to zero URLs.

Subject: Annotations to changing documents
Status: RO

Why not treat the document as if it were frozen, but keep an md5
digital signature of the document with the annotation along with some
context.  If the signature then and the signature now are different,
you know the document has changed.  At this point, plonk up the
annotation where it would have been (with a note saying ``annotation
may have moved'') and let the user move the annotation around to where
they think the annotation should be now.  This moved annotation then
replaces the old when it is saved.

Rather than completely automating something this complicated (which
can't be done without placing artificial restrictions on what can be
annotated), I think you'll probably either have to (a) ignore the
problem, or (b) provide for human intervention.

Cheers;

Nat.

Tim, this really begs the following question:

	If I am a browser which only displays monochrome GIFs, and the 
	item is only available as a 24bit colour JPEG, whose responsibility
	is it to do the conversion?

	I'd expect that instead of having the server tell the client that
	it can serve it only as:    image/jpeg  colours=24
	and leave the retrieval decision to the browser, (which most times
	is less powerful and feature-ful than the server), 
	would it not be a better decision to have the browser tell the server 
	what  capabilities it had, and let the server make the proper 
	conversions to serve it in an appropriate form?

	The server is more capable of doing the conversion and making
	intellegent decisions regarding what is required to meet the needs
	of the browser.  

	The other way round the server must tell the client what *possible*
	forms the property can be served in, and this quickly becomes 
	unmanageable.  (Consider that GIFs are available with the following
	attributes:  width, heigth, colour(bits), dots-per-inch, aspect)

From: Jay Glicksman <jay@bogle.eitech.com>
Status: RO

I've just read the HTML+ pre-RFC and have a couple of requests/comments
on the FIGT overlays:

We are interested in doing annotations as overlays (i.e. the user can
draw arrows pointing to sections of text and make notes "on top" of
the base document).  This would be used on top of "regular" HTML+ text
as well as FIGs. So, we would like to see FIGT permissible anywhere in
the body of a document, not just within a FIG. We know that the
position of text is not fixed in an HTML(+) document but are still
interested in this type of annotation (cf. discussion on "annotations
to changing documents").

Also, we would like to have multiple annotations as separate overlays
(e.g. so different people's comments could be in different layers).
There is a comment in the spec that "Figures shouldn't be nested" that
would seem to rule that out.  We'ld prefer to have the reverse:
"overlays can be stacked".

Comments?

Hmmm, sounds like negotiation is what's called for, eh?

The Gopher+ model allows the server to offer the client multiple
views, and the client gets to pick what it wants.  That could
easily extend to the idea of the server holding data in one form,
and offering several views (that don't physically exist), offering
to translate to the form the client asks for.

Of course, in many cases the client will launch an external viewer
and won't really know for sure what in fact is best for that viewer.

FIGT as it stands is inappropriate outside a figure, since the attachment
mechanism is defined as an offset on the figure itself. Perhaps the PANEL
element is what you need. This is attached by an id reference, and would seem
ideal for your needs. For online use it could be rendered as an icon of a
thumbtack/drawing pin at the appropriate place. Clicking on taht would show
a popup panel with the arrow back to that point. The panel should have
buttons for next/previous when there are several annotations attached
to the same point (also show a number/cue indicating how many there are).

The restriction forbidding nesting of tables, forms and figures is there
to help browsers and authors avoid overly complex documents. When a lot of
comments are made on a document, this presents choices to the reader:

    a)  To read all comments by a given person,
        and then to go onto the next person and so on
or
    b)  To read all comments attached to a given point
        regardless of author and then go on to the next point

Both of these would could be implemented by getting the server to send the
annotations separately from the original document. A neat solution is to use
the MIME multipart capability to segregrate annotations according to author
(itself passed in an RFC 822 header). The browser is then responsible to
merging them with this document, as appropriate to user preferences.

In any case the current HTML+ format seems adequate. Although it may be worth
adding a ROLE attribute to the PANEL tag, e.g. role="annotation".

What do you think?

I think this is slightly overstated.  URNs refer to documents
which will be static products.  You really open a can of worms
if you say this this strongly.  Does this mean that the URN working
paper cannot have a URN?  I like the print world analogy.  Sometimes
a book is reprinted with minor corrections and sometimes it becomes
a 2nd edition.  In these cases the reprints with corrections
would have the same URN and the 2nd edition would have a different
one.  The author and publisher (URN authority) determine which is 
the case.

The only difference in the two cases is that "minor corrections"
can occur only with some difficulty (and it is obvious from
the text, by convention on the printing history page, which version
you have).  In the electronic case, changes can occur willy nilly
and there is no history.

Cc: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Status: RO

I have been experimenting with images in HTML documents, and I have discovered that
the embedded images may display badly when viewed on a black and white monitor, using 
the Mosaic browser.

Of course, when viewed with xv, the xv viewer automatically dithers the images - 
so the results are acceptable - saving the images in dithered form does not however
assist the viewer which is in-built to Mosaic.

It is possible to force the images to dithered form by saving them as X bit maps, but
then all colour information is lost.

What is required is:

     Colour information displayed correctly on colour displays - OK as now.

     Colour information displayed with dithering on black and white displays - this would
     require Mosaic to determine the type of display while running.

     xv seems to cope with this OK, so maybe you could modify Mosaic to do likewise


Other browser developers may need to note this point.

  You mean I can't have a URN that refers to a service who's contents change
over time? That means weather servers can't have URNs since they aren't
static? I thought the whole reason we had the publisher having the final
decision over URN equality was so that we could cover ground like this without
having thousands of URNs for essentially the same document.

If URNs do not refer to living documents, than what does?  I can't see  
creating two mechanisms, one for static information and one for dynamic.  URLs  
are already used in WWW, which is certainly a vehicle for dynamic documents  
(such as the demonstration annotation server).  If URNs are to be useful, then  
they must be THE Universal mechanism for all resources.

        I can't quite get the hang of using gopher/waisindex searches of
html documents with xmosiac.  I've got a bunch of html documents that I
want to index.  I can build the index OK with waisindex, and can use gopher
to search them and retrieve the document I want.  The problem is that once
I've retrieved a doccument, none of the hypertext links in the retrieved
document work.  What happens is xmosaic assumes all relative links should
be gopher: links instead of http: links.  How do I convince it not to do
this?

Subject: XMosaic 1.2 and HTML+
Status: RO

Hi,

I downloaded and printed the HTML+ manual and noticed quite a bit of
changes and differences to the existing HTML.

The question is: Can I try out HTML+ already with the current XMosaic 1.1?

BTW, the HELP on XMosaic indicated that I am using version 1.1 and that
version 1.2 is "Now available; maintenance release." However, I haven't
been able to locate version 1.2 anywhere. Where can I find 1.2?

Thanks.
Omy

I spoke hastily without considering the issue fully.  I apologize for
being unclear.  My only excuse is that it has been a trying week.

What I meant to say is that what a URN refers to is really the provence of
the publisher.  What is at issue here, I feel, is not what the URN refers
to as much as how the URN is used. 

In the best of all possible worlds, URNs are most valuable as pointers to
static resources because there is a strong tendancy to use them to refer
to the entire product *and* as a base for references to portions of
products. 

If a URN can be assumed to point to something which must be taken as a
whole (atomic), there is no problem.  The content may change at the whim of
the publisher, and the URN is still a valid reference because there are no
dependancies associated with that URN.

If a URN can be used as a base for further pointers into a product, the
relationship between the whole document and its parts must not change or
else these pointers may become invalid. If this relationship does change,
there must be a new URN.  (If a URN refers to something which contains
other URNs, is there a requirement that the first URN be marked static? I
think so.  Or else, I think we need to have a hierarchy of dependance of
URNs, ie. these URNs are valid as long as this one has not changed.)

So there seems to be an argument here for URNs to refer to leaves and
never to branches (atomic elements and never collections of other products)
unless there is some way that the branch URN can be guaranteed to be static
or we have a method of representing URN dependancies.

--------
I believe that there is a real value in having some way of refering to a
truly static resource.  Within a static resource, links to internal
content are guaranteed to be valid as long as that resource can be
retrieved. This is a very important aspect of the problem, because if we
cannot guarantee that links to portions or pieces of a product will remain
valid, we must always refer to the product as a whole or run the risk of
creating invalid pointers.

Put another way, I need to be assured that these instructions will allow
me to retrieve this thing.  If the thing to which I refer is a whole file,
or a complete product, the instructions are valuable.  If, on the other
hand, the thing I wish to retrieve is a part of a whole and those
instructions are based on the structure of the whole, I need to be assured
that the relationship of the whole to its parts has not changed or those
instructions no longer refer to the thing I intended. 

Can this be answered by some information associated with the URN which
states that the product to which it refers is static? 

----------------
Micheal Mealling brings up the idea that a URN might refer to a service,
which by its very nature is dynamic.  There is a distinction here, I feel,
between a service and its content.  The service itself is static -- it exists
over time and does not change.  So the reference to the service is static.
The content of a service is the dynamic part.  

I think what I am trying for here is that the service itself is the
product, one which provides access to other potential products.  As a
product, the service can be assigned a URN, but that URN cannot guarantee
the content of that service. 

In the final analysis, all of this is all left up to the publisher.  If I
publish a paper which people refer to parts of, and I change that paper
(its content) without creating a new URN to it, I have potentially
invalidated those references others have made to portions of my paper.  It
is my responsibility, as publisher, to make sure that, if I feel this is a
BAD THING, it does not happen.

It may be that you can't get away with having one kind of URN. Why not
have both 'mutable' URNs and 'immutable' ones?

The mutuable ones refer to 'the latest version of this thing, as
determined by the author', while the 'immutable one' refers to 'this
is as good as if I had put away a copy'.

When you assign a URN, assign two. When you update it, the update
keeps the mutable URN and gets a new immutable URN.

Nope -- we haven't implemented support for it yet.

True, so we would like to be able to define offsets relative to the
document itself, either in coordinates or via "at" (as in PANELs as
you suggest).

This has some of the features of what we want but is missing the
crucial characteristic of being an overlay.  We'ld like to do
annotations where someone can circle a section of text, draw arrows
between sections of text, point to their own comments, etc.  We see
each user's comments being on a layer that sits on top of the original
document (as I mentioned in my previous message we are aware of the
issues of the mutability of the document text).

>The restriction forbidding nesting of tables, forms and figures is there
>to help browsers and authors avoid overly complex documents.

Understood, but then you go on to describe several ways to allow
multiple comments on the same document.  I understand what the
browser would do with multiple comments; what I don't know is the
HTML+ syntax that could be used to specify them.

>Both of these would could be implemented by getting the server to send the
>annotations separately from the original document. 

That would be excellent and we can see putting a mechanism into the
browser to give the user a choice of which annotations to view.
However, that still begs the question of what is the HTML+ format of
those annotations so that the browser knows where to place them after
it retrieves them.

>A neat solution is to use the MIME multipart capability to segregrate
>annotations according to author (itself passed in an RFC 822 header).

That is exactly the approach that we have taken.  We've also added a
MIME part in which we can store geometric information, but we would
really prefer a "standard" way of describing that in HTML+.

How about this?  (Actually this might be in my document, I don't remember
if I put it in.)

	Assume that we make a URN which names a document,
	when I request information about that document/product, I
	specify a version number, *or* I ask for the current version.

	Functionally this would be:

		<registrar://ora/nutshell books/some book> is an implicit
		reference to the current version

		<registrar://ora/nutshell books/some book:2.0> is an
		explicit reference to something which does not change,
		ie. version 2.0 of the book and

		<registrar://ora/nutshell books/some book:0.0> is an
		explicit reference to the current version

I'm begining to think the problem here is that  we are trying to 
legislate morality.

First, what we are talking about is a symbolic reference here.  Symbolic
references don't make any sense unless you know what they are symbols
for.   When you write a program you don't pick an arbitrarily variable
to use as the end of a for loop, you have to know which one contians
the information you want.  

Second, there has been some talk about delegation of registration 
authority.  How are you going to get the registrar for a particular
area to conform.  If McGraw-Hill decides to use their pool of URN's
in a contrary way do you think you have the clout to say I'm sorry
you can't publish.

I think we don't particularly care whether a URN points to a changing
resource or a static resource. What we care about is that a person
has some means to find out what a symbol is for.  The question
is far bigger than static/dyanmic, draft/non-draft, all you want to do
is know what you got.

Perhaps we need a prefix operator like, showing my age pdp-11 assembler.

show #<URN>: Displays information on the server that knows about
             this URN (Possibly useful)

show <URN>: Displays the abstract for this resource.  E. g. "The current
            front page of the new york times"

show @<URN>: Displays the resource which the URN points to.

Hi,

I have been experimenting with a browser implementation using HTTP/1.0, I have 
found several imcompatiblities between various servers as follows:

1. The servers supporting HTTP/1.0 respond differently when accessing a document  
   whose type was not in the "Accept" list on the GET command. Servers eaither:

   a) (e.g the BSDI server) Return the HTTP/1.0 header followed by the requested  
      document.

   b) (e.g: the CERN server) return the requested document with no header. 

    Question: Should servers return the whole document even though
              the client does not "Accept" that type of document? Would it be
              better just to return a polite error message in a format the
              client does understand?
 
              Behaviour (a) at least seems a reasonable alternative, but (b)
              seems particularly unfriendly.

2. The servers supporting HTTP/1.0 return different "Content-type: xxx/yyy"
   in the HTTP/1.0 header for the same file type.
   (e.g. BSDI server return "Content-type: image/xbitmap" for bitmap file
         while HCC server return "Content-type: application/binary".)

   I personally like the response from the 
   BSDI server.  The "Content-type: image/xbitmap" is clearer than
   "Content-type: application/binary". Also, I prefer the BSDI's return of
   "Content-type: archive/xxx" and "Content-encoding: yyy" for an
   archive encoded file (eg: .tar.Z) rather than the "application/octect-stream".
 

3. For the servers NOT supporting HTTP/1.0, some of them ignore the HTTP/1.0
   header and treat the request as HTTP/0.9, but some do NOT ignore and 
   return an error message. This makes it difficult to switch over to HTTP/1.0.
    
   Example of Servers ignore HTTP/1.0 header are NCSA, Indiana University, etc.
   and servers do not ignore such as CCIT Arizona, Corell, etc. 

4. Most of the server NOT supporting HTTP/1.0 take the HTTP/1.0 header 
   as an index search whenever dealing with a search.
   (e.g. http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:81/www.cis.ohio-state.edu/ultrix? 
         http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:1235/man/index  )

What about the fact that for instances of <url> in raw HTML or PRE

that ignore SGML tags they don't understand will just strip <...>
right out of the text altogether?

Hmmmmm...

Maybe I miss-parsed your sentence, but I think that the systems that
we build for caching, replication, distribution, location of URLs from
URNs will care quite a bit whether the URN is a changing resource or a
static one.

URNs are not like ISBN numbers, in that we're talking about using them
in systems and protocols; if someone builds a FTP server that doesn't
really talk the FTP protocol, then people won't be able to use it
effectively. If McGraw-Hill were to proclaim that some of their
variable URNs were static, people who maintained caches of McGraw-Hill
documents would get false cache hits. The system wouldn't work.

Secondly, we *could* very well use some scheme for URNs that couldn't
be subverted, e.g., use a one-way hash of the original document data
as the immutable URN, or use a URL with a time-stamp, rather than some
more subjective measure of 'identity' for the implementation.

Speaking for Plexus:
I currently ignore the Accept field though I do plan to use it for format
negotiation in the near future.  However, my feeling is that if a client
doesn't understand the returned type it should offer to dump it to a file
and I prefer to include the actual content-type instead of just tagging
it application/octet-stream so the user might have a clue as to what to
do with it.

What do other people think?  If this is a good idea maybe Tim should
mention this under "tolerating clients/servers".

Note that application/binary isn't a valid MIME type, it's supposed to be
application/octet-stream.

The MIME people are partially to blame for this mess, a) they should have
defined more common types up front and b) it seems to be a pain to get
new types accepted (I haven't tried but the fact is that not many types
are registered so something must be wrong).

See below for my list of types in case anyone wishes to "standardize" on
what I've dug up (aka seen other people use) OR tell me I'm full of it
and need to fix ones that are "wrong".  I just dug these up (mostly from
NCSA Mosaic and TkWWW plus various postings I've seen) so many may be
wrong and I'm happy to fix them if someone will just tell the most common
usage.

Yes, that would be annoying, somewhere in the CERN docs it explicitly says
you are supposed to ignore it.

Keep in mind that the MIME documents that define the initial content-types 
have to pass the Internet standardization process; this implies certain 
constraints, including : having a precise specification for each
content-type that permits independently developed implementations to 
interoperate, and consideration of security issues.

The registration process for nonstandard MIME types is somewhat less stringent.

Part of the reason that "not many types are registered" is that it
does take some time to discover what the registration process is.
There's also some unwritten "MIME culture" that has to be learned if
newly defined types are to fit within the MIME framework.  The various
parties are becoming familiar with the issues and trying to address
them.

The following types are not registered:

The following types are not registered, and have security concerns.
The rfc822 extensions working group considered proposals along these
lines and rejected them for this reason.  This does not mean that such
types cannot be registered (registration itself does not imply
endorsement), but an analysis of the security risks is needed.

Other stuff:

> $ext{'html'}  = $ext{'HTML'}  = 'text/html';
Not registered yet; I think the proposed name is for application/html.

> $ext{'rtf'}   = $ext{'RTF'}   = 'application/x-rtf';
There is actually an application/rtf type registered; so you don't need the X-.

> $ext{'mime'}  = $ext{'MIME'}  = 'www/mime';
This should probably be "message/rfc822".

> $ext{'shar'}  = $ext{'SHAR'}  = 'archive/shar';
> $ext{'tar'}   = $ext{'TAR'}   = 'archive/tar';

New top-level types are harder to register.  There are also security
concerns that need to be addressed.

> $encoding{'uu'}  = $encoding{'UU'} = 'x-uuencode';

X-types don't require any agreement, of course, but some MIME mail
readers do support the "x-uue" encoding.  The filename within the
uuencoded file is likely to be ignored by these mail readers.

Having just hacked at my server to better support HTTP/1.0, this discussion
couldn't come at a better time (I haven't installed the new version yet;
so no bug reports :-).

Is "Content-encoding" a standard MIME field?  No matter, either way
I think that "Content-encoding" is a good way to say if something is
compressed.

I think offering to dump unknown content types is good browser behaviour.
It appears that an older version of RFC1341 would have made
"application/octet-stream" a reasonable response since it had some
properties for giving the user clues about the data: "type" for
the content, "name" for a suggested file name to save as and "conversions"
for information on what fiddling was done with the data (encrypting,
compressing, etc.).  But they've dropped that suggesting that
"Content-Disposition:" replace name.  I guess "Content-encoding:"
can nicely replace "conversions", but I dunno what to do with "type".
I'd suggest that we just put the real type in "Content-type" and
use "Content-Description" to describe the document and its format.

Such a shame -- "archive" seems like a logical and useful top level type.
On the bright side, there's a golden opportunity here to define an
official shar format that can be unpacked with "sh" _and_ be undone
with a simple C program (or a short but bewildering perl script :-).

Except for "text/html" (or "application/html"), we should really be
using "x-" forms until there are official types registered, right?
So sending back a compressed tar file might look like:

Content-type: x-archive/x-tar
Content-encoding: x-compress
Content-transfer-encoding: binary
Content-disposition: files.tar.Z
Content-description: compressed tar archive of some useful files

Rob et al,
whilst the scheme you outline (concatentating a mutable name with a version
number) works in select cases, I can think of situations where it doesnt work
so well.

If for example the URN is derived from a high precision digital signature
algorithm then that URN has no mutable info at all.

I don't know whether it is a bug in Mosaic or not, but using BACK to return to
a previous anchor does not seem to work if the anchor is in the same file.

Sometimes it is useful to structure a document in one file, if only for distribution
purposes, rather than splitting it up into a group of related files.

I tried the same operation using the CERN Line Mode Browser on my data, and that
did manage to go back to anchors in the same file.

Is this another feature that browser writers need to consider carefully?

I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature :-), but if the anchor is of the
form

   <a href=#label>

then the link won't be recorded the window history and Back will not go
back to the anchor, but if it is of the form

   <a href=[regular URL stuff]#label>

then it will be added to the history list and Back will work as you had wanted
it to.  I thought this was intentional and found it to be useful!  Now I'm
wondering about those _other_ browsers...

Yes, we have noticed the same thing.  I'm not familiar enough with the HTML
specs to say if that's a bug or not, but it's certainly not the expected,
or desired, behavior.

I disagree.. let's say you have a list of local links in your file, e.g.
in a table of contents or something like that. Now if you click on one of
these links, it'll take you somewhere else in the file, and the only way to
go back is by scrolling back and forth and trying to find where the heck you
came from... I *do* consider this a bug! Not keeping the local link in the 

history list is ok, but one outh to be able to go back.

Cheers, Chris

Look at it from the point of view of the casual browser (person).  You
click on something and it goes somewhere.  You click on Back, and it goes
back.  That's all they need to (or should) know.  This behavior adds a
hidden twist -- you have to know whether the link is to somewhere else in
the same file, or to another file.  There is (as far as I can tell) nothing
visual distingusing the two types of links, so the user has no way of
knowing which it is.

	This was not what was intended, but I suppose as Tony
	says it could be construed as a good idea. One way to
	control it would be to allow www/source to represent
	the source whatever it was, and to allow the client to give
	that as a (very low weight) option on every request. The
	same dummy content type could be used to request the
	source whatever it is.  This would allow clients bothered
	for example by waiting for pictures they can't display
	to turn it off.
	If nothing matching is found, then an error should be
	returned.

>   b) (e.g: the CERN server) return the requested document with no

	This is a deliberate bug introduced by teh -DXMOSAIC_HACK
	option in the libwww.  It is put in because otherwise
	XMosaic would not be able to read anything except for
	plain text and HTML. The MOMENT that mosaic uses HTTP2
	then all servers should turn off this hack!

	Two qustions here. One is standardisation of types -- I'm
	not going to talk about except to say that if MIME are
	too restrictive we can *define* HTTP types to be mime
	types OR http types whcih are registered separately. No
	sweat.

	Second question is why things differ. Application/binary
	(should be octet stream) is used in eth CERN server as
	a default. The default, and indeed the relationship
	with any file suffix, can be set up in the rule file.
	You just have to keep the confiug info in your perl
	and teh config info in your httpd.conf rul file 

	equivalent if you wnat the same results.

	If you find a server which returns an error message you
	seend mean messages to its system manager.  We have
	the problem with the VMS HELP gateway which we havenn't
	bothered to fix... but oterwise we have fixed any we had.

I'm not sure how you can disagree with "I found it useful".  I happen to be
a noted authority on my own opinions :-).

About the link behavior: your example is a good one, and you could use the
second (albeit rather verbose) form and it will behave as you want.  All I was
saying was that I found the other behavior to be useful in some circumstances.

Now, whether that behavior is legitimate with regard to HTML specs is another
matter...

"Back" is not defined by the HTML specs (nor are the semantics of
following a link, I believe).  But my vote would be to have a 1-1
mapping between forward and backward moves, with the motivation that
it's less confusing for the first-time user.  I'm sure that the
complaint which triggered this thread will occur times and times again
as long as Mosaic has its current behavior.  On the other hand, I
expect that nobody will complain when "Back" moves back in the same
file.

Marc, could we have this, please?

This is very strange behaviour.  A partial URL is an abreviation
for a full one.  No information was intended to be conveyed by
the fact that it was abbreviated! The NextStep editor will allways  
write out a link in minimised form when a file is edited, so this
rather questionable information will be lost!

Instances of <url> are NOT allowed in raw HTML of course!

This is strictly a method for mentioning URLs in plain text.
It meamns that you can use URLs without HTML.  

Given that users won't in general see HTML (and as a general rule  
anyway) this
is a good thing.

Parsing
plain text is only a guess of course, there is nothing
to stop someone writing <http:junk> to confuse people.

IF <url> is represented in HTML (PRE or otherwise) it will of course
be &lt;url> and there will be no problem.

Due to the way word wrap depends on the font and window size etc. it is
impractical to use coordinates outside of figures (or perhaps PRE stuff).

The idea of showing a circled portion of the original document is appealing
but doesn't work when you can't say where a line break will occur or which
words will be under each other. Just change the window size and it all
changes.

What one could do is to mark a particular sequence of words or characters
as being pertinent to a given comment. This could be done by inserting
the appropriate markup into document, in the same way that HTML+ handles
change bars. The PANEL tag can be held separately, but relies on there
being predefined anchors to attach to.

In the absence of write access to the document and any suitable anchors,
one is then forced to adopt character offset from known points or pattern
matching, as the basis for attaching comments.

The HTML+ syntax permits multiple PANEL elements to be attached to the
same anchor using the AT attribute:

    <p id=z35>Some text that you want to comment on.

some where else:

    <panel at=z35>Thats daft, why don't you ... </panel>
    ...
    <panel at=z35>Another comment on the same paragraph</panel>

I think that a role attribute would clarify the use of the panel element
e.g. role=annotation.

We could extend the FIGT element to have an IDREF which names the figure
to which it applies. This would allow these to be kept separately as well.

Hoping thats clear.

My browser used to work this way, but I decided it was a definite BUG, e.g
its a real pain if the document took a long time to download, and you
hit Back and its gone! All links now go onto the history stack.

I probably didn't make it clear in my message but we are aware of this
issue and are looking into ways of "circumventing" it.  Even with the
possible limitations that might result, we still think a WYSIWYG
drawing tool on stacked layers would be an appealing way to do
annotations.

This looks promising.  I don't see anything on change bars in my
version of the html+ document. I'll get the newest version.

I think both of these would be useful.

Yup, and Mosaic 2.x will have the opposite behavior from Mosaic 1.x
(due to popular request, and the fact we needed to support it for some
other stuff anyway).  So it'll be fun to see how many people think the
2.x way is a bug :-)...

Well, it's not quite *that* simple.  The original decision (and yes,
it was a decision) was to put _documents_ in the history list.  Moving
around inside a document was thought to be different than moving to a
new document.

Like I said, 2.x reverses this policy.  Now, the question is: I go to
document foo.html and scroll to line 58.  A hypertext reference leads
to #myanch and I follow it, jumping to line 699 (which is where the
named anchor 'myanch' sits).  Now my history list looks like --

        foo.html        [cached line 58]
    --> foo.html#myanch [explicit line 699]

So then I scroll down to line 784, and then go 'back' (which jumps me
up to line 58).  Now the history list is:

    --> foo.html        [cached line 58]
        foo.html#myanch [explicit line 699, cached line 784]

NOW, if I go 'forward', should Mosaic put me on line 699 or line 784?

Hope this makes some sense,
Marc

In my mind, there is no question that 784 is the right answer.  That being
said (and in such an absolute fashion), I can understand how other people
would see things differently.

I guess a more succinct way to ask your question is "does back mean go back
where you came from, or does it mean re-traverse the last link you
traversed before you got here".

If one really wanted to be pedantic about this, one could say that the real
meaning of scrolling down is to pretend you are traversing a link to the
next line in the document.  Thus, in your case, doing the back would get
you to line 784, and doing additional backs would scroll you in reverse
back to 699, and then finally jump you back to 58.  I doubt, however, that
that's the behavior people would expect (or want) to see.

I don't quite follow the logic here. Why does the hack to support HTTP/0.9
for mosaic have to affect the behaviour of the server when a HTTP/1.0 client
is trying to connect. This makes it very hard to try out HTTP/1.0 now, and will
also make it difficult for mosaic when it does support HTTP/1.0, unless all
servers are instantaneously upgraded.

If the hack is changed to affect only the HTTP/0.9 protocol now, then the 
transition to HTTP/1.0 will be easy and not involve any instantaneous upgrades
in the future.

Or have I missed something here??

Subject: saving URL's
Date: Thu, 15 Jul 1993 16:44:36 PDT
Sender: dcmartin@library.ucsf.edu
Status: RO

I have wanted to be able to save URL's for some time and have now hacked
Xmosaic to support this feature.  This feature allows you to find a
document via navigation and then save the URL for that document in the
UNIX filesystem as a symbolic link (and, of course, open the local file
and have it interpreted as a URL).

Comments, bug fixes, etc... appreciated.

BTW: You need to -DCKM and add search.[co] to the Makefile.

Saving URL is a really nice idea.  I have been lobbying here for
the same thing.  Users should be able to save the pointers
to things, rather than the things themselves.  I have
been thinking that we ought to be able to save URL
in folders and organize them as I do email messages.  Nice work.

At the IIIR working group I learned that the MIME type registry is now
open to register many more types than was originally intended --
apparently some Gopher people had the same idea and convinced some
people it was useful.  I don't know exactly what the rules are but it
should be possible to register any type for which you want a
standardized name.

Subject: WWWWorkshop
Status: RO

Tim and the others:

Unfortunately I cannot attend the WWW workshop in the US. I am   
looking after the needs of users (mainly in the CERN environment, but  
believe they are not special). I have here summed up the most urgent  
wishes for development of WWW in the near future. I would like you to  
consider them at the meeting, and wish you all a fruitful gathering,  
brainstorming and wise reflection. 


Robert.



Among the wishes, two stand out far more strongly than any others:

1) how do authors who are not computer literate put information
   into the web?
For this, we need:
- a portable HTML editing object plus some ancillary objects for
  setting styles etc.
The moment we have html editing, a large number of people will be  
able to provide urgent information themselves as if they were using a  
word processor. A number of features now proposed or in use will also  
become unified and/or irrelevant: hotlists, document lists, saving  
and organising of URLs and all these schemes dreamed up by those who  
could not from the first use Tim's browser for the NeXT, and have not  
experienced direct WWW authorship.
I would consider any transformation of files in existing formats as  
useful but not adequate in the longer term.
- simpler server installation and configuration.
- serving of different sets of documents from the same machine on the  
same port 80.
Today it is difficult to organise both html directories and several  
indexes from the same machine unless you use different ports and run  
many servers.
I also take the opportunity to repeat that there is a grant available  
for any interested developer to work at CERN (provided he/she holds a  
passport of a CERN member state).

2) how do we protect the documents that belong only to our workgroup  
from unauthorised access?
This we are doing now (Ari Luotonen, luotonen@dxcern.cern.ch)  
according to the design of http2, and thus it is being taken care of.

Then there are to my mind a number of smaller items but which are  
important for the continued future:

- anything that will unify and simplify the URLs.
Do not let them grow into large unintelligible things. When I see a  
URL, I want to have an idea of what it is that I'm going to get.
Is there really a need to have so many protocol specifiers? Can some  
be unified with others?

- indirect documents (to deal with both relocations and references,  
most of that is defined in the http protocol now).
This must also include program documents: the URL specifies the  
script to be run by the server at the server site, e.g. complicated  
Oracle queries.

- decide on a (very) few formats for graphical material, and  
implement their viewers as part of the browsers. This does not  
exclude that any arbitrary format can be handled within a closed  
community through the general format negotiation.
However, I do not wish to accumulate tens of viewers just because  
there are pictures out there in all those formats. Providers also do  
not wish to waste storage to keep copies in multiple formats.
A few wisely chosen formats displayed inside the browser window (i.e.  
without launching separate processes) would certainly drive the  
provider community in a direction.
Personally, I see two main graphics uses: (1) drawings (scalable and  
composed of editable objects, like technical drawings and diagrams)  
and (2) images (bitmaps, like photos).
Having seen some of the uses, I think for drawings PostScript (and  
the new PDF format of Adobe) are essential. While some packages are  
notoriously bad for generating huge PostScript files, good drawing  
packages such as Illustrator and xfig generate very compact and  
well-behaved files.
For images clear contenders are GIF and JPEG.

Well, it's not quite *that* simple.  The original decision (and yes,
it was a decision) was to put _documents_ in the history list.  Moving
around inside a document was thought to be different than moving to a
new document.

Like I said, 2.x reverses this policy.  Now, the question is: I go to
document foo.html and scroll to line 58.  A hypertext reference leads
to #myanch and I follow it, jumping to line 699 (which is where the
named anchor 'myanch' sits).  Now my history list looks like --

        foo.html        [cached line 58]
    --> foo.html#myanch [explicit line 699]

So then I scroll down to line 784, and then go 'back' (which jumps me
up to line 58).  Now the history list is:

    --> foo.html        [cached line 58]
        foo.html#myanch [explicit line 699, cached line 784]

NOW, if I go 'forward', should Mosaic put me on line 699 or line 784?

Hope this makes some sense,
Marc

----- End Included Message -----

Surely it depends on whether the significant "objects" from the readers
point of view are the just the anchors, or also include points from which jumps
have been made.

If only anchors are considered, then the history list as in the example above
is correct, and the forward jump should be to line 699.

If however, the point from which the Back command was issued is also of
interest, then it should also be included in the list. However, it should be put
in front of the previous anchor... so we would now have ....


    --> foo.html        [cached line 58]
        foo.html - back ref to line 784
        foo.html#myanch [explicit line 699]

What is now going on is that instead of having a single list, there are really
two lists - its a fairly standard data structures situation - you could use code
something like ....

BACK (docstate(doc,#line), (d1,#n1):backlist, forwardlist)
     = (docstate(d1,#n1), backlist, (doc,#line):forwardlist)

FORWARD (docstate (doc,#line), backlist, (d1,#n1):forwardlist)
     = (docstate(d1,#n1), (doc, #line):backlist, forwardlist)

        { I hope I got this right....mmmm!}

The problem with this is that sometimes there will be a need to discard items -
and also that if the state of each document is maintained as it was before each
"jump", then the size of the forwardlist and backlists will increase, simply
by alternating between FORWARD and BACK, but moving the cursor in between times.

Discard policy would then have to be considered more carefully. If ONLY anchors
are stored in the forwardlist and backlist, then this particular problem should
not occur.

As it is, I am not sure what policies browsers, such as Mosaic, actually use to
discard document states from the forward and backward lists - perhaps trying to
reach an document state which is already on the backward list should be noted,
and be stored - but even this could be upsetting for some - thus

Visiting:        A B C  A D 

could store      A B C  A D
with full retracins, or

 only            A D  where it is noted that docstate A has already been visited

I guess the storage for the necessary lists is only going to be of the order
of a few KiloBytes for each session, so that isn't a major problem - there is an
additional difficulty if the data referred to is also going to be cached, since
this could put the storage requirements up considerably. However, the issue of
maintaining the history list is not directly related to the caching problem - it
is not necessary to discard items from the history list, simply because local
space for caching is not available - it should be possible to fetch the data
again.

I hope this helps.

Dave

Subject: File names and URLS
Status: RO

As a user, I want to know whether there are any inherent conflicts in WWW URLs
and file names. On our Unix system, there does not appear to be a major
difficulty, since file names can be pretty long. However, we also support IBM
PCs, and they share some of the same fileservers. This causes us problems when
we try to access the same files on the IBM network - because names longer than
8 or with extensions longer than 3 get mapped into other filenames.
 (My true feelings about this are barely printable....
      IBM get your act together....)

Maybe the accessing a file by its URL will still work - even if the names
are compromised, but I rather doubt it....

When the Cello browser becomes available, it is possible that we will wish to
use that on IBM PCs as well as Mosaic on Unix. Presumably Cello will be able
to access our files on our fileservers via a Unix machine, and the correct files
will be retrieved. If, however Cello attempts to get at the files locally, via
the network file server, then the file names could be incorrect! 

One other thing is that Cello seems to expect HTML files to have an extension
of .htm whereas Mosaic uses .html 

It seems to me that if we use short file names, with 3 letter extensions, then
there may be some chance that we could use single copies of files, without
having to develop complex aliasing mechanisms --- I'm sorry about this - why
the world has to conform to the lunacies perpetrated by IBMs continued attempts
to sell software systems developed using obsolete notions of file names .......

I'll give up now, before the wires burn!

Has anyone else looked at this?

I'll look for .htm as well as .html for 2.x (although Mosaic assumes
anything not otherwise typed coming over http is html anyway, so there
shouldn't be any immediate problems here).

There are now two separate VMS ports in ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu,
/Mosaic/xmosaic-contrib.  See particularly README.VMS and
xmosaic-1.2.VMS.tar.Z, a full source distribution contributed by Bjorn
Nilsson of CERN.

As we are still an unfunded project and barely have the manpower to
stay afloat these days, and we have a huge heaping plate of things we
want to do, we are unable to support VMS.  Among other things, this
means that Mosaic 2.0, when it's released, won't have native VMS
support.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause,

Anyone know what's up with the WWW server at Ohio State Univ?  There seems
to be some data transfer when I connect to http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/
but the browser displays a blank screen and quits! (or returns to the HTML
doc with the link there)

And there's no one at webmaster@www.cis.ohio-state.edu, and I don't
remember anyone's address there... (at least, who has anything to do with
the web...) 

Thanks,
	Joe

There is a short term and long term solution to your problem. The short
term solution is for a PC server/browser to generate an 8 character
filename with 3 letter extension to match the longer name and then either
maintain its own internal database of filenames or generate names on the
fly. Quite a few software packages already do this, though it has its
problems; if the algorithm used to generate the filename.ext name comes up
with a duplicate name for a given directory then it truncates filename to
filenam1 and so on, which isn't very pretty and means the same file might
have a different name when moved to a different directory.

The long term solution (next year) is to wait for Windows 4.0 aka Chicago
aka Windows NT Lite which uses the same file system as Windows NT (so say
the industry rags ;>) so you get 256 character filenames  and then the DOS
FAT compatibility module of the OS generates the filename.ext for you just
in case some DOS weenies try and access your file system.

Mac people of course would like names to stay under 31 characters which is
the Mac filename limit, Mac names also can't contain colons, which is used
to separate directory names like "/" under Unix and "\" under DOS. In
general, you wouldn't want to use real long names (approx. 50-256
characters) anyway because names would then start looking like sentences or
even whole paragraphs, wrapping on the screen and prone to many typos by
less than perfect humans.

Hopefully, URNs would allow you to have many name variations for the same
item otherwise the problem you're having with DOS will be forever with us.
The same file is going to end up having a French name variation, Kanji
variation, German variation, OS variation, etc. If URNs won't solve this
problem, then we probably need to agree on some algorithms to consistently
map from the URLs to a variety of different OSs and maybe languages as
well.

I know.  The daemons are running (or were a few minutes ago).  The
host that they run on has been flaky, which is to say that it isn't
acting right and I don't know why.

If you are still seeing problems, let me know, please.

Also, don't know if this is part of your problem, but none of our
daemons conform to the current http specs.

I just created webmaster, so that should work from now on.  Did you
try to send mail to postmaster or root or anything like that?  If so,
I didn't see it...

   There are a couple of problems with the www servers out there.  The
one on port 80 just spits out a blank line and then exits.  And the
texinfo server on port 85 does not respect HTRQ requests.  It will
always fail saying 'Cannot find blahblah htrq or blahblah htrq.info'.

   Can whoever is in charge of these servers fix 'em up? :)

   Thanks,
    Bill P.

Perhaps this could also be seen in the context of the IETF UR* work.   The URI  
(Universal Resource Identifier) working group already has on the table  
proposals for URL (Universal Resource Location), URN (Universal Resource  
Name), and URM (Universal Resource Modifier).  It could make sense to have a  
Z39.50 request within this framework (URM ?).


The UR* effort has among its goals to provide a standard means of accessing  
all Internet resources.  WWW is certainly something that could utilize such a  
request, and Gopher/WAIS are candidates too. 


I think both the ZIG and UR* efforts would benefit from some joint work.  The  
UR* community already has representation from the MARC world.

I cannot attend the WWW conclave, but wish to affirm the priorities  
suggested by Robert Cailliau -- most particularly, his recognition of  
the importance of easier authorship of HTML documents.

Cailliau also mentions incorporating into browsers the ability to  
display

>  a few wisely chosen formats (for graphics)

including Adobe's new PDF format.

Adobe offers a public specification for PDF in the "Portable Document  
Format Reference Manual" (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-62628-4, US$  
24.95). It doesn't seem to be available from Adobe's server,  
ftp.adobe.com (130.248.1.4), but it's available from booksellers.  
There may be more information available from the Adobe Developers  
Association (US$ 195 to join, +1 415-961-4111 or +31-20-6511-200).

Here's what's interesting so far:

PDF files are much more compact than PostScript files.

Adobe offers commercial products that will generate a PDF file from  
any Mac or Windows application and from any PS file generated on any  
other platform.

Unlike PS, text can be extracted easily from PDF files for copying.

PDF files can contain hyperlinks -- though only within the PDF file.

It appears the format of PDF link annotations could be extended to  
accomodate URLs, if browsers were available to read them.

PDF hyperlinks are rectangles on a page (that is, they are not  
anchored in text and can be placed over nontextual matter).

Adobe has stated that the PDF format is extensible and indicated a  
willingness to work with third-party developers (unfortunately,  
Adobe's organization is such that commercial developers gain easier  
access).

I'd be happy to hear from anyone who's interested in working with  
Adobe. Perhaps we can develop interest in WWW at Adobe.

(Forgive the non-elagance of these comments, its late :)

Howdy, just finished reading through the HTML+ RFC, and have a few comments
about it.

1) The specification allows </> to be a valid end tag for all tag's.  I feel
this is a mistake as it leades to great ambiguity when the document is bein
parsed automatically, or being read by a human.

2) It appears that both the <img> and <fig> tag should be rolled into one, as
both accomplishes esentially the same thing.

3) Physical styles should remain seperate tag's as they are currently
implemented in HTML.  (I.e <b> instead of <em b>).  The <em> tag should refer
exclusivly to logical role's, and not physical styles.

(How come I have this dreaded feeling im about to be flamed? :)

At the IIIR group on the IETF I heard that someone was writing up a
dsescription of Z39.50 as currently in use by WAIS over TCP/IP, and
would submit it as an informational RFC.  (Sorry, I've forgotten the
details.)  This might be relevant, as it will make Z39.50 much more
accessible to developers (the ISO standard is unreadable in my eyes).

And isn't there native support for Z39.50/WAIS in the next version of
libWWW, meaning there is already a possibility for peaceful
coexistence?

Yup -- in fact, I've got freeWAIS 0.1 linked happily with Mosaic 2.0
(development version) via libwww2.

On a related topic, at IANET in Pittsburgh, Jim Fullton & others came
to a general consensus that it'd be nice to allow WAIS to separate
indexing from retrieval -- the upshot would be that WAIS could, in
response to queries, return URL's and URN's that do *not* necessarily
correspond to documents within a traditional-style WAIS database.
E.g. you could get back a list of hits like this:

        gopher://foobar.com/argh/blargh
        news:13523514514253@2314654321545132.34154351453
        http://yoyodyne.com/bigboote/john
        ...

This would be unbelievably sweet.

Cheers,
Marc

Subject: html-mode.el, version 2.0 (beta)
X-Md4-Signature: 2345f98e46448ae48299cfb978e548bd
Status: RO

Following is a revised html-mode.el; call it 2.0 (beta) -- it really
should be 2.0 (crappy beta) since it still has problems and hasn't
been cleaned up to pristine, machine-like perfection yet.  But I've
procrastinated long enough.

In particular, the font-lock support doesn't seem to work (at least
under Lucid Emacs 19.6) and I'm not sure why, and I've been too
embarrassed to ask jwz.  I'm'a workin' on it, slowly and
sporadically.  Fixes welcome, oh please oh please.

A couple of people have sent in very interesting major improvements to
html-mode.el in the last couple of months, which is great, but none of
'em have been rolled into the current version yet (so much carpal
tunnel syndrome, so little time, sigh).

So lemme know what ya think.  5:30am Sunday, Black Sabbath replaced
Beethoven two hours ago and I think it's time for bed...

Cheers,
Marc

;;;
;;; html-mode: Major mode for editing HTML hypertext documents.
;;; Revision: 2.0 (beta)
;;;
;;; ------------------------------ INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------
;;;
;;; Put the following code in your .emacs file:
;;;
;;; (autoload 'html-mode "html-mode" "HTML major mode." t)
;;; (or (assoc "\\.html$" auto-mode-alist)

;;;                               auto-mode-alist)))
;;;
;;; Emacs will detect the ``.html'' suffix and activate html-mode
;;; appropriately.
;;;
;;; You are assumed to be at least somewhat familiar with the HTML
;;; format.  If you aren't, read about it first (see below).
;;;
;;; Here are key sequences and corresponding commands:
;;;
;;; NORMAL COMMANDS:
;;;
;;; C-c a         html-add-address
;;;   Open an address element.
;;;
;;; C-c b         html-add-blockquote
;;;
;;; C-c C-b       html-add-bold
;;;   Open a bold element.
;;;
;;; C-c c         html-add-code
;;;   Open a 'code' (fixed-font) element.
;;;
;;; C-c C-c       html-add-citation
;;;
;;; C-c d         html-add-description-list
;;;   Open a definition list.  The initial entry is created for you.
;;;   To create subsequent entries, use 'C-c e'.
;;;
;;; C-c e         html-add-description-entry
;;;   Add a new definition entry in a definition list.  You are
;;;   assumed to be inside a definition list (specifically, at the end
;;;   of another definition entry).
;;;
;;; C-c C-e       html-add-emphasized
;;;   Open an emphasized element.
;;;
;;; C-c C-f       html-add-fixed
;;;
;;; C-c g         html-add-img
;;;   Add an IMG element (inlined image or graphic).  Note that the
;;;   IMG tag is currently an extension to HTML supported only by the
;;;   NCSA Mosaic browser (to my knowledge).  You will be prompted for
;;;   the URL of the image you wish to inline into the document.
;;;
;;; C-c h         html-add-header
;;;   Add a header.  You are prompted for size (1 is biggest, 2 is
;;;   next biggest; bottom limit is 6) and header contents.
;;;
;;; C-c i         html-add-list-or-menu-item
;;;   Add a new list or menu item in a list or menu.  You are assumed
;;;   to be inside a list or menu (specifically, at the end of another
;;;   item).
;;;
;;; C-c C-i       html-add-italic
;;;   Open an italic element.
;;;
;;; C-c C-k       html-add-keyboard
;;;
;;; C-c l         html-add-normal-link
;;;   Add a link.  You will be prompted for the link (any string;
;;;   e.g., http://foo.bar/argh/blagh).  The cursor will be left where
;;;   you can type the text that will represent the link in the
;;;   document.
;;;
;;; C-c C-l       html-add-listing
;;;
;;; C-c m         html-add-menu
;;;   Open a menu.  The initial item is created for you.  To create
;;;   additional items, use 'C-c i'.
;;;
;;; C-c C-m       html-add-sample
;;;
;;; C-c n         html-add-numbered-list
;;;
;;; C-c p         html-add-paragraph-separator
;;;   Use this command at the end of each paragraph.
;;; 
;;; C-c C-p       html-add-preformatted
;;;
;;; C-c r         html-add-normal-reference
;;;
;;; C-c s         html-add-list
;;;   Open a list.  The initial item is created for you.  To create
;;;   additional items, use 'C-c i'.
;;;
;;; C-c C-s       html-add-strong
;;;
;;; C-c t         html-add-title
;;;   Add a title to the document.  You will be prompted for the
;;;   contents of the title.  If a title already exists at the very
;;;   top of the document, the existing contents will be replaced.
;;;
;;; C-c C-v       html-add-variable
;;;
;;; C-c x         html-add-plaintext
;;;   Add plaintext.  The cursor will be positioned where you can type
;;;   plaintext (or insert another file, or whatever).
;;;
;;; C-c z         html-preview-document
;;;   Fork off a Mosaic process to preview the current document.
;;;   After you do this once, subsequent invocations of html-preview-document
;;;   will cause the same Mosaic process to be used; this magic is
;;;   accomplished through Mosaic's ability to be remote-controlled
;;;   via Unix signals.  This feature is only available when running
;;;   Lucid Emacs v19 (it will maybe work with GNU Emacs v19; I'm not
;;;   sure).
;;;
;;; COMMANDS THAT OPERATE ON THE CURRENT REGION:
;;;
;;; C-c C-r l     html-add-normal-link-to-region
;;;   Add a link that will be represented by the current region.  You
;;;   will be prompted for the link (any string, as with
;;;   html-add-normal-link).
;;;
;;; C-c C-r r     html-add-reference-to-region
;;;   Add a reference (a link that does not reference anything) that
;;;   will be represented by the current region.  You will be prompted
;;;   for the name of the link; if you just press RET, a numeric name
;;;   will be created for you.
;;;
;;; SPECIAL COMMANDS:
;;;
;;; <, >, &
;;;   These are overridden to output &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;
;;;   respectively.  The real characters <, >, and & can be entered
;;;   into the text either by typing 'C-c' before typing the character
;;;   or by using the Emacs quoted-insert (C-q) command.
;;;
;;; C-c <, C-c >, C-c &
;;;   See '<, >, &' above.
;;;
;;; ---------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------
;;;
;;; If you are running Epoch or Lucid Emacs, highlighting will be used
;;; to deemphasize HTML message elements as they are created.  You can
;;; turn this off; see the variable 'html-use-highlighting'.
;;;
;;; To reorder all of the link NAME fields in your message (in order
;;; of their occurrence in the text), use:
;;;
;;; html-reorder-numeric-names
;;;   Reorder the NAME fields for links in the current buffer.  The
;;;   new ordering starts at 1 and increases monotonically through the
;;;   buffer.  If optional arg REORDER-NON-NUMERIC is non-nil, then
;;;   non-numeric NAME's will also be numbered, else they won't.
;;;
;;; HREF arguments in anchors should always be quoted.  In some
;;; existing HTML documents, they are not.  html-mode will
;;; automatically quotify all such unquoted arguments when it
;;; encounters them.  The following variables affect this behavior.
;;;
;;; html-quotify-hrefs-on-find       (variable, default t)
;;;   If this is non-nil, all HREF arguments will be quotified
;;;   automatically when a HTML document is loaded into Emacs
;;;   (actually when html-mode is entered).
;;;
;;; -------------------------------- GOTCHAS ---------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML documents can be tricky.  html-mode is not smart enough to
;;; enforce correctness or sanity, so you have to do that yourself.
;;;
;;; In particular, html-mode is smart enough to generate unique
;;; numeric NAME id's for all links that were (1) created via an
;;; html-mode command or (2) present in the file when it was loaded.
;;; Any other links (e.g. links added via Emacs cut and paste) may
;;; have ID's that conflict with ID's html-mode generates.  You must
;;; watch for this and fix it when appropriate; otherwise, your
;;; hypertext document will not work correctly under some browsers.
;;;
;;; html-reorder-numeric-names can be used to reset all of the NAME
;;; id's in a document to an ordered sequence; this will also give
;;; html-mode a chance to look over the document and figure out what
;;; new links should be named to be unique.  However, note that doing
;;; so may confuse references to named anchors from other HTML
;;; documents.  Beeeeeeee careful.
;;;
;;; ------------------------- WHAT HTML-MODE IS NOT --------------------------
;;;
;;; html-mode is not a mode for *browsing* HTML documents.  In
;;; particular, html-mode provides no hypertext or World Wide Web
;;; capabilities.
;;;
;;; The World Wide Web browser we (naturally) recommend is NCSA
;;; Mosaic, which can be found at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic.
;;;
;;; See file://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3 for w3.el, which is
;;; an Elisp World Wide Web browser written by William Perry.
;;;
;;; ------------------------------ WHAT HTML IS ------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a format for hypertext
;;; documents, particularly in the World Wide Web system.  For more
;;; information on HTML, telnet to info.cern.ch or pick up a copy of
;;; NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System via ftp to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu
;;; in /Mosaic; information is available online through the software
;;; products distributed at those sites.

Subject: Weird problem getting HTTP/1.0 to work in my emacs browser
Date: Sun, 18 Jul 1993 15:41:06 -0500
Message-Id: <28029.743028066@mango.ucs.indiana.edu>
From: "William M. Perry" <wmperry@mango.ucs.indiana.edu>
Status: RO

Ok, lets see if anyone out there can figure this one out.  I'm just
slightly confused this problem. :)

I have been working on my emacs www browser, trying to get HTTP/1.0 to
work.  Now, as I understand it, a valid HTRQ would look something like
this:

GET /somefile.html HTRQ
From: wmperry@mango.ucs.indiana.edu
Accept-encoding: x-compress; x-zip
Accept: Accept: application/postscript
Accept: application/dvi
Accept: application/latex
Accept: application/tex
Accept: application/texinfo
Accept: application/x-rtf
[...] more headers here
User-Agent: Emacs-W3 .904b

^^ Blank line to end header, ala rfc822

Problem is, on some servers this will return a truncated page.  I
checked, and my process-sentinel isn't jumping the gun, the
network-stream had actually closed, its just that part of the file
didn't come through.  If I go to a shell window and telnet to the host
and send it the string GET /somefile.html HTRQ it responds immediately
with the whole file.  (As its supposed to, since this one I know
doesn't grok HTTP/1.0 fully)

Sooooo - is it the extra lines that don't get actually sent to the
network stream that are causing the process to die early?  (Typical
request is ~750 bytes)  Is there some sort of maximum string size that
you can send via process-send-string?  (Doubtful, since it works fine
on lots of servers that understand the new protocol, and others that
don't)    <<< On the odd chance any elisp hackers are reading. :)

Also - the files are always truncated in the same spot.  (I don't see
how it could be net lag either - this crops up going to NCSA from IU,
with an average round trip time (according to ping) of 29
milliseconds)

Could this be a problem with the servers?  (Doubtful since it works
when it only gets sent the one line)  The only server I've been able
to find this on is www.ncsa.uiuc.edu - /evl/Welcome.html always gets
truncated after "The animations are in a RGB file format and".
(Although I just retrieved it, and it worked, retrieve it again, and
it gets truncated after 'format and')

As I said, very weird.  1 person has reported that the HTTP server
here at IU shows similar flakiness with this new HTTP support, but I
haven't been able to make it die yet.

If I take the call to w3-create-mime-request out and replace it with
just a plain old "GET file" it works great.

Anybody out there that can shed some light on this?

Thanks in advance,
    Bill Perry

Rre type registration problems.  As of this IETF, the type registration
process is going to be significantly loosened up. With no artificial
barriers to registering types and the requirement for a formal
definition loosened up to allow things like "Files produced by version
xx.yy of AAAsoft's BBB product".  This is going to make iiir work 
much easier, and forstalled the likelihood of at least gopher setting up
its own type registry.

Subject: PS chart: Gopher, WAIS, WWW usage-- WWW growing
Status: RO

The attached chart shows relative usage of Gopher, WWW, and WAIS on
the NSFnet backbone.   Cautions to note in interpreting the chart:

1) This is the NSFNet backbone, so it doesn't show usage in Europe
or the rest of the world.  Relative usage may vary elsewhere.

2) This is based on using IANA values; it's fairly common to serve data
on ports other than the assigned ones.

3) One protocol sometimes gets credit when another "owns" the data.
Example:  I run a WAIS server and a Gopher server that points to it.
If you retrieve info from my WAIS server over the NSFnet via the Gopher
link, Gopher gets "credit".

4) These are packet counts, not raw bytes.  I picket packets because that's
closer to a transaction count (e.g. users clicking on huge documents,
such as MPEGs or giant text files, don't skew the numbers quite as much).
Note that Merit gathers these numbers as samples, not absolute counts.

5) These three well-known networked info tools still don't dominate the
traffic; FTP ranks number 1, with 22% of the packet traffic, which is 

*** 18 times *** the level of Gopher, which ranks number 11.

Comments:  


Gopher continues its dominance and growth among these three, but WWW is
really beginning to take off. WWW is now ranked 21, 0.276 of traffic. WAIS,
ranked 29, remains relatively stable, its traffic having actually declined
in May, but that may be due in part to the masking effect mentioned above.

Subject: Execute a shell-script to search
Status: RO

I've taken the standard CERN (2.06) daemon and added an executable
shell script ability to it.  What it now does, when it is given
keywords on a URL like http://host/path/file is:

 -- expand /path/file using the rules file, giving a filename
 -- look for filename.search
 -- if it exists, execute it with the search keywords as arguments
    -- whatever this returns is passed back to the client verbatim
 -- if it doesn't exist, fail

This has enabled me to put in my home.html file,
	<ISINDEX>
and make a file called home.html.search that contains

	#!/bin/sh
	ARGS=`echo "$*" | /bin/sed 's/ /\?/g'`
	/usr/local/bin/www -source "wais://wais.vuw.ac.nz:90210/this-server?$ARGS"
	exit 0

thus enabling users to search the home-page directly, and get the
results of a WAIS search back.

Sexy, eh?  Diffs follow.

Cheers;

Nat

Subject: launching executables through HTML files: solved?
Status: RO

It doesn't make sense to let *other* sites exec your programs, so why
not have a check in the HTRule() code that compares the previous URL
to this URL, and checks if the previous URL's address was one that is
``acceptable''.  Acceptable could be defined in a .client file or a
rule file, or simply through guesswork (same class-B/C address?).

Comments?

Neither Xmosaic nor the CERN library (2.09 or so) supports the BASE

have it.

Next release, please?

I think I'm a bit confused about the current WAIS debate.
In the above case you get URL's back. Unless you have a WWW browser they
are no good, so I assume you are using a WWW browser to send the searches.
Then where does the need for WAIS come in?

Can you not achieve the same thing by having waisindex generate an index
of a file with titles, keywords and URL's, and have a command line WAIS
client called from the HTTP server, or compiled into the HTTPserver do 
the lookups? This would eliminate the need for the WAIS protocol, and in
effect you only use WAIS's impressive search performance as part of your
server implementation. If you then educated the server about say a suffix
indicating a WAIS index file you would have a really flexible capability.

I have been thinking about doing this for the Mac Archive, but as I know
nothing about WAIS, a Perl script will have to do for now...

Am I missing some vital bit of insight?

Subject: WAIS and WWW patches
Status: RO

I've just finished some rough and ready code to implement the
following behaviour:
 -- waisindex can cope with documents of type URL, in so far as it
    sets the headline to be the URL of the document
 -- HTWAIS.c in the CERN library knows about files of type HTML and
    delivers them as such
 -- HTWAIS.c in the CERN library knows about files of type URL, and
    formats the results of a WAIS search accordingly.

This is pretty ugly behaviour (test it out on
http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home.html which is searchable -- searching it
searches a WAIS database using the patches I described previously) but
it works.  In the future, a smart HTML-aware part of waisindex should
be written to suck out the <TITLE>...</TITLE> text and use that as the
headline, storing the URL in the DocID.

Anyway, add this to the irbuild.c file in the section where all the
various document types are defined

---begin
      else if(0 == strcmp("URL", next_argument)) {
        dataops.type = "URL";
        typename = next_argument;
        URL_trim = s_strdup(next_arg(&argc, &argv));
        URL_prefix = s_strdup(next_arg(&argc, &argv));
      }
---end
and add this to the help section:

---begin
  fprintf(stderr,"           | URL what-to-trim what-to-add /* URL */\n");
---end

irtfiles.c now has in index_text_file

---begin
  /* Make the current filename accessible via global variables.
   * Increment current_filecount so routines can efficiently detect
   * changes in the current file.
   * -- Prentiss Riddle, Rice ONCS, riddle@rice.edu, 5/6/92
   */
  
  if(current_filename == NULL) current_filename = s_malloc(MAX_FILENAME_LEN+1);

  if (URL_prefix && !strncmp(filename, URL_trim, MIN(strlen(URL_trim), strlen(fi
lename)))) {

SGML tags act like brackets and must be properly nested. There is therefore
no syntactic ambiguity. However, in the real world, people do make typos and
you are right in suggesting that this abbreviation would make it harder for
browsers (and people) to recover from errors.

Before I remove this feature, does anyone else feel the same way?

I have included IMG for two reasons.

    a)  for simple captionless graphics, which are positioned
        as part of the current text line.

    b)  for backwards compatibility with HTML (X Mosaic and Cello)

The single tag mechanism was adopted to solve the issue of a proliferation
of emphasis tags. Everyone has different ideas on the appropriate set, and
I felt that we needed a mechanism that didn't freeze in today's prejudices.

Physical styles are hints to the browser, and independent of the logical
role of emphasis. I forsee browsers ascribing particular styles to certain
roles which override the hints. It didn't seem worth keeping <b>, <i> and <u>
given that the others had been removed.

Not all tags are brackets (e.g. <BR> and <P> aren't).  The HTML-0 spec
has the useful property that if you ignore unknown tags and end tags
you can still match up properly the tags that you do understand, even
if you don't know whether the unknown tags are brackets or not.  I
don't know if in HTML+ specifies that unknown tags must be ignored.
If it does, </> introduces a problem: if you've ignored a tag and then
you find a subsequent </>, you don't know if the tag you ignored was
bracket or not, and hence you don't know whether to ignore the </> or
match it up with the previous bracket.

In other words, I'd like to see </> go as well.

Fine, but what happened with HTML-0 compatibility?  You leave <IMG> in
for compatibility, but drop <I> <B> <U> in spite of it.  Personally
I'd really favor being completely backward compatible, since it
appears that HTML-0 might have a long life of its own, especially once
canonicalized as an informative RFC.

---

Some unrelated remarks of my own after scanning through the HTML+ doc
(can't find my copy now so I'm working from memory here):

1) The section where you address implementers and give various hints
about the implementation doesn't really belong in a spec of this type
-- maybe it can be an appendix.  It is quite possible that I want to
implement HTML+ in a totally different context than a web browser
after all, and I prefer to have just the specs as a defining
document.

2) The overview of tags mentions the <ICON> tag -- I suppose this
should be <IMG> and <FIG> tags.

3) The definition of <P> allows some attributes (I believe an "ID" for
a link destination) that label the paragraph.  Unfortunately <P> is
between two paragraphs -- which one gets the attributes?  (Some styles
of formatting raw HTML keep the <P> tags consistently at the end of
the first paragraph, others don't.)

WAIS handles the searches, so your starting point in the web is a
document that's relevant to your topic of interest.  It's easy to
implement already, and getting easier.  If you're running a WAIS client,
you call an external viewer (like NCSA Mosaic) to display documents of
type URL (or HTML) - just as you'd use an external viewer to display a
document of type GIF or TIFF.

It's efficient because you don't have to retrieve an entire document
using WAIS - only a URL.  If you let the WWW client handle the document
retrieval from the URL, you always have the documents in context - i.e.,
you always retrieve from the HTTP server, so things like relative links
work correctly - they don't if you use WAIS to retrieve the document.

You probably could, but this seems to require less code hacking.  It's
not a hard thing to do - it's a clever thing ;-)

I agree completely. I don't want to use WAIS for document retrieval.

> It's easy to implement already, and getting easier.  

I am not quite sure what you are referring to here... 
implementation of WAIS in a WWW client?

What I am after is the best way an information provider can provide a
searcheable index of web-accesible information into the web.
I want the performance and the algorithm of WAIS, but I don't really want to 
have to run a WAIS server, and I'd like to have some HTML control of how the 
results are displayed. Have a look at the searches in my Mac Archive to see
an example <http://web.nexor.co.uk/mac-archive/welcome.html>. Another
application would be the UU Meta library.

If you generalise this I want to do WWW searches for keywords in a file
with three fields, like:

	title	keywords	URLs(or any HTML)

and get a list like:

	<H1>Results</H1>
	<H2>A title</H2>(Score: 1000)
	...the HTML, with a pointer to some document...
	<H2>Another title</H2>...

This would give a general framework to publish indexes, especially if I
can just run a program on this file, and dump the result somewhere under
a HTTP server that would know what todo with it.

If there is an easy way to do the above I'd love to hear it.

Exactly.  However, you would like to separate the two functions as it
would allow you to index information contained in various objects
(files, etc...) and then utilize that index to return some compilation
of those objects or some other object (e.g. indexing a database of faxes
utilizing the OCR text, but actually returning the fax, not the OCR text
file).

I think I'm a bit confused about the current WAIS debate.
In the above case you get URL's back. Unless you have a WWW browser they
are no good, so I assume you are using a WWW browser to send the searches.
Then where does the need for WAIS come in?

Can you not achieve the same thing by having waisindex generate an index
of a file with titles, keywords and URL's, and have a command line WAIS
client called from the HTTP server, or compiled into the HTTPserver do 
the lookups? This would eliminate the need for the WAIS protocol, and in
effect you only use WAIS's impressive search performance as part of your
server implementation. If you then educated the server about say a suffix
indicating a WAIS index file you would have a really flexible capability.

I have been thinking about doing this for the Mac Archive, but as I know
nothing about WAIS, a Perl script will have to do for now...

Am I missing some vital bit of insight?

PDF viewers have to be able to render PostScript! Rendering is slow even in
Adobe's browser...

>PDF files are much more compact than PostScript files.

Depends on what kind of information is in the PostScript file versus the
PDF file. PDF files wouldn't normally contain font information because the
Arobat viewer relies on Multiple Master font rendering (another thing you
need), yes LZW compression can be used on text and there are lots of
options for compressing images using "lossy" techniques. To make a fair
comparison, run a .ps file through the distiller and see what you get. Keep
in mind that PDF and the Acrobat technology right now is oriented towards
screen viewing, so resolutions higher than 72-100 dpi are usually a waste.

There will be a Unix version as well. The output from the PDFWriter is
fine, but if you output from a desktop publishing application or your
document contains embedded PostScript, etc. you have to use the Distiller,
just like for .ps files; this is a slow process and the licensing on the
Distiller is much higher than the basic Acrobat viewer/PDFWriter.

While PDF has promise, it has a completely different focus than the Web
right now, specifically presentation instead of structured documents. The
Web will have worldwide multi-user editing and annotation of HTML documents
across multiple platforms well before Adobe even knows if Acrobat is a
flop. Adobe definitely has to take the ball here. While they might change
Acrobat's market focus in the future to work with networked hypertext such
as the Web, it won't happen anytime soon and it would be a waste of energy
right now to pursue PDF as part of the Web.

We can however benefit from some of the interface elements used in Adobe's
viewer, which have been used in viewers before, so the ideas are well
tested. One, graphical browsers should be able to generate "thumbnails" of
a user settable "page" size as a navigation aid within a document;
eventually this iconic view can be extended to give a 2-D or 3-D overview
of a document and its links to other documents. Two, outline views of
document(s) and their links should be available. This would also simplify
identifying annotations and threads of annotations related to a particular
point or link within a document. A browser could even follow links within a
document, caching potential destinations and showing those as part of the
hierarchy. The "outline" view might be a separate window (floating on the
Mac or Windows), or appear as a dynaic menu or split pane on the browser
window. Three, the ability to copy information from a document, either in a
HTML and/or formatted form (including font and style information) should be
supported when possible, especially on the Mac and Windows platforms where
the "clipboard" is standardized across applications.

I'm definitely in favor of </>; I think it's very clean and quite
nice, and as its meaning is completely deterministic there's no reason
not to have it.

It's fine with the Mosaic folks if IMG goes or stays (we're not
emotionally attached to it :-).

I don't recall much discussion on browser recovery from errors. I thought
that the general idea was to have a server do the parsing so that browsers
aren't complicated by lots of error checking code. A server either parses
the document  or it doesn't, how likely are non-parseable documents anyway,
once people stop hand entering all the codes, this is the 90s you know ;)
Even if a server just verifies the correctness of a document before a
client does its own parsing would simplify matter greatly.

In the future, most people will never see the tags, since their editors
will generate the codes automatically, but not show them on screen and
their browsers wouldn't show them unless requested. How often do you see
the formatting codes of your favorite word processor, desktop publishing
program, etc. (WordPerfect users need not answer :>)?

For now, when editing, it is much easier to make a typo when YOU have to
match up your tags than if you always end a tag as </> (you probably would
even bind this sequence to a single keystroke).

Verbosity in the form of requiring a tag end other than </> has little
value today, longer end tags increase file size (though not much),
increases the number of typos when hand entering codes, and probably has no
value as editor/browsers become more sophisticated.

Will HTML+ and future HTML versions have version identifier tags so that
backward compatibility can be maintained without complicating the parsing
process. It isn't necessary for current HTML documents to have any kind of
identifier, but if HTML+ and future versions had a version tag to go at the
beginning of the document, then that would simplify extending HTML in the
future and also allow a document to be parsed differently based on its
version. A document without a version would be parsed as the current HTML
spec or what appears in the upcoming RFC.

Kevin Altis makes the point

Yes, very true. PDF and WWW will be used differently. HTML is  
suitable for structured documents. PDF is suitable (Adobe tells us)  
for cross-platform exchange of unstructured documents.

There may be times we want to include unstructured documents within  
an HTML document. For example, drawings or maps. Or documents that  
were created in applications that don't translate to HTML. 


Is PDF suitable? There will be questions of performance. There may be  
insurmountable technical problems (e.g., how does a WWW browser  
handle Multiple Master font rendering).

But we might consider accomodating PDF, if it allows us to bring in  
documents from many diverse origins, especially if it allows us to  
bounce out of the unstructured "presentation" document to the wider  
web of HTML documents (through a hyperlink, if the PDF link  
annotation were extended to accomodate URL/URNs and a browser could  
handle this). It's worth exploring.

Regards,
Daniel Kehoe

P.S. Kevin's consideration of interface elements was also very  
intriguing.

I would like to again bring up the error detection problem.  Let's say
you are in the middle of transmitting a document and you get some kind of
error (disk error, processing error, whatever).  There is currently not
any clean way to notify the client.

We can partially solve this by using the <EMBED> tag, something like this.

HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows

Content-type: text/html

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Sample Document</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Everything is going along just fine...</H1>
And then BOOM... we get a disk error or something.

<EMBED TYPE="www/mime">

<BODY><H1>Server Error: 500 Internal Error</H1>
document ``foo'' does not exist <P>
If you feel this is a server problem and wish to report it, please
include the error code, the requested URL, which and what version
browser you are using, and any other facts that might be relevant to: <P>
<ADDRESS>webmaster@BSDI.COM</ADDRESS>
</BODY>
</EMBED>

But that doesn't completely solve the problem, as we might be in the middle
of some other <EMBED> or something like that, and what happens when you
"double fault" (get an error inside an error)?

Ideas?

There are already an overwhelming number of documents like this that we
reference and want to reference in the future, including many bitmap
formats, PostScript, dvi, spreadsheets, formatted documents from various
word processors, etc. Support for PDF should be through the same mechanism
as handling PostScript documents or any other non-HTML document that will
be displayed or rendered by a different application or DLL (in the case of
Mac or Windows) rather than the browser itself. Translation of other
documents to PDF or encapsulation of some sort would consume too much time
and space. A browser should not have to understand PDF.

I discussed some of the methods that could be used to provide hypertext
references to non-HTML material in an earlier message (LinkToLiving). This
needs to be addressed for the existing large body of non-HTML documents
since those documents will always outnumber HTML documents by several
orders of magntitude. PDF is a minor issue in comparison.

I also think that there is a real need to a </> tag.

Is this the proper time to mention that <P> really
needs to be a container (ie. <P>Content</P>) ?

The abstraction of <P> being a seperator and not
a container is the cause of much woe for those of
us interested in defining styles.

Why is this?  The <P> as separator makes sense to me, and is valid
SGML.

Is there a way to print a document currently being viewed so that graphics
are also printed out?

I selected File, Print, lpr -Plw27 and selected Postscript.

It only prints text.

Thanks.

Please bear in mind that many, many, many more documents are likely to

Kevin,

You made the point,

> Support for PDF should be through the same mechanism
> as handling PostScript documents or any other non-HTML document

I agree with you -- from the point of view of architecture, why  
should PDF be a special case.

But consider my point of view as an information provider. Suppose I  
have a book that contains text and drawings. I'd like to distribute a  
hypertext version of the book. I'd like to know that the format I  
pick for my drawings can be read by most (or all) WWW browsers. PDF  
might be that format, for the reasons I outlined earlier. Is there a  
better format to use as a default?

Furthermore, as an information provider, I want to distribute only  
one version of my book. I can distribute a single PDF file with  
assurance that any Mac or Windows user can read the document (and DOS  
and UNIX users too, when Adobe achieves its promises). (This begs the  
question, "will Acrobat catch on" -- but anyone can buy an Acrobat  
reader in an Egghead Software store for $40 and I'm willing to take  
that chance).

Suppose the first page of the book said...

"If you have a WWW browser and an Internet connection, click here for  
a more current version of this book (across the net). If you are  
using an Adobe PDF reader, click here to learn more about WWW and the  
Internet (information in this local file)."

If the PDF link annotation were extended to accomodate URL/URNs, and  
the user's WWW browser read PDF files, the user could bounce to a  
newer (and structured) HTML version of the book. If they can't, well,  
I'm still assured they can read the version they've got and maybe  
they'll get web-happy later.

As an information provider, I want to be assured the format of the  
files I distribute can be read by as many people as possible. I'm not  
going to be distributing the majority of my books across the net  
(that would limit my market for now). But I'd like to offer the  
advantages of the Web's Internet hyperlinks to readers who can use  
them. Of course, PDF ability doesn't have to built into every WWW  
browser for this. I can hope some WWW browsers are installed with PDF  
viewers as linked applications. But that still leaves me with the  
problem of not knowing if I've picked a format that can read by most  
WWW users. So I'd prefer to see native support for PDF in WWW  
broswsers.

Of course, we need to recognize that this is wildly speculative right  
now. I don't know that a WWW browser can accomodate PDF and I don't  
know that Adobe would accept a proposal to extend the PDF link  
annotation specification. But it's worth exploring.

Regards,
Daniel

I'd like second Rob on the issue of EMPTY P elements, since this issue
is something I've been thinking of the last couple of months...

Nat writes:

It is valid, but - in my view - it is not very good SGML. 

I assume that the DTD in http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.dtd.html
is current(?). 

Come to think of it, could someone (Tim? Dave?) summarise the status
of and plans for W3 DTDs? I have a very old one, dated 15 Jul 92, made
by Dan Connolly, then there is the one I referred to above and then
there's the HTML+ DTD (which I haven't seen).

I agree with Rob's point that

> 	   There is a strong habit for authors to think if the <P> as a

Looking at the DTD, there is actually more cases where I find the use
of EMPTY tags unfortunate.

For example (quouting from http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.dtd.html, 
with a lot omitted)>

     <!ENTITY % inline "EM | TT | STRONG | B | I | U |
			     CODE | SAMP | KBD | KEY | VAR | DFN | CITE "    >
     <!ELEMENT (%inline;) - - (#PCDATA)>
     <!ENTITY % text "#PCDATA | IMG | %inline;">
     <!ENTITY % htext "A | %text">
     <!ELEMENT DL    - -  (DT | DD | P | %htext;)*>
     <!--    Content should match ((DT,(%htext;)+)+,(DD,(%htext;)+))
	     But mixed content is messy.  -->
     <!ELEMENT DT    - 0 EMPTY>
     <!ELEMENT DD    - 0 EMPTY>

Why not make this:

     <!ELEMENT DL	 	- - ((DT+,DD)+) > 
     <!ELEMENT (DT|DL)		- O (%htext;) >

(or something similar)? It corresponds to the comment by the DL
declaration? Of course there is mixed content in this too, but that is
inevitable due to structure of %text;. Of course, in this example
there is no room for P elements in DT and DD, but that could be worked
out.

What I don't understand is the choice to have EMPTY tags which CREATES
problems with mixed content.

To go back to Rob's point, I think the same problem occurs with the
declaration of the P element. The structure of HTML instances would be
much clearer if no text could occur outside of elements (ie. all the
text that is currently outside should be put in P elements).

Please note that this would not have to incur a lot more tagging since
the end tag of P should be optional. The main difference is really in
the _interpretation of the instance_, since text would be interpreted
as the _content_ of P. In terms of actual tags, a <P> tag would be
required before the first paragraph (or text, really) rather than:

     <BODY>
     bla bla bla
     <P>bla bla bla
     </BODY>

we should have:

     <BODY>
     <P>bla bla bla
     <P>bla bla bla
     </BODY>

			     ---

At the Euromath Center we work on the development of the Euromath
System, a system which at the core has an SGML editor. I am developing
at Network Information Service module for Euromath, which - hopefully
- will provide Euromath users access to both Gopher and W3 information.

I have developed the necessary bit and pieces to let me export HTML.
That way we get WYSIWYG editing of HTML. The idea is to create a
translator that will let me read HTML, thus producing a real WYSWYG
HTML editor.

I intend to include browsing capabilities (time permitting) when the
translator is functional.

Tim has been asked by folks in the IETF for something to identify HTML docs
as being such, and I have included in my spec the recommendation that authors
include a version statement. The standard way to do this in SGML is via
the DOCTYPE element, e.g.

        <!DOCTYPE htmlplus PUBLIC "-//Internet/RFC xxxx//EN">

This states that the document conforms to the htmlplus DTD as defined by
the named publicly available specification. The name used here will be
instantiated to something more formal by the time the HTML+ spec becomes an
RFC, and would change with subsequent revisions.

This may seem like overkill for small manually keyed documents, but with
WYSIWYG editors almost upon us, it will be entered automatically as a matter
of course when you create a new document.

Why do I keep thinking we want the same thing? :-)

Yes, definately separate the retrieval from the indexing.
But how are you going to display the results of the search to the user?
In your example, if I search the database of faxes, I'd want to see a list 
of results like say

	<LI><A HREF="...">Fax</A> from m.koster, 19 Jul 1993, 10K (Score 1000).

rather than just something like:

	<LI><A HREF=".../fax_08932">fax_08932</A> (Score 1000)

Either you build a special server that generates this extra info on the fly,
or you need to generate it beforehand. The latter is far more general.
What I am after is how to best do it, preferably integrated in a HTP server.

I have yet to come across a server which checked an existing HTML
document for correctness.

But if in future most HTML will be automatically generated, typos
aren't a problem, are they? Anyway, I use html-mode.el in GNU emacs, so
even though I see the tags, I don't type them per se.

Not when things are working normally, no. However, when they DON'T,
verbosity is very useful. SMTP/rfc822 mail headers could be much more
terse than they are, but I'm glad they aren't. C blocks simply use {
and }, but I still put in comments and indent so that I can quickly
match the pairs. The difference between </> and </a> is minimal in
size, but signficant in meaning. Please remember that even automatic
HTML generators are still debugged by hand at some time.

While we're about it, I like with the idea of treating <p>,</p> as
bracketing tags, with an implicit </p> preceding the next <p> if
necessary. I have two reasons: first, this allows for paragraphs to be
display differently (e.g. poetry); second, figures (other than in-line
icons), titles, etc are not paragraphs (as I understand the idea), and
I reckon that it makes more sense to have them explicitly defined as
being outside paragraphs.

Is it reasonable to extend the implicit </p> idea to other tags, e.g
there is an implicit </h*> before every </p>, i.e.

<h1>Chapter heading    <----- Implicit </h1>
<p>Paragraph           <----- Implicit </p>
<p>

etc. I reckon this would make even for less verbosity than </> but
still be very human readable.

Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.36.1.1]
Status: RO

The workshop is now coming up fast, and I would like to update the HTML+ spec
to include recent comments, to give everyone a chance of printing out a copy
in advance of traveling to Cambridge.

    1)  Minimization of the end tag to </>

Allowing this causes problems with unknown tags, which may or may not
have end tags. I therefore propose to forbid all forms of minimisation.

    2)  Backwards compatibility with HTML

        Two ideas:

        a)  Include <CITE>, <MENU> and <B> etc. in the DTD as
            deprecated elements for backwards compatibility

        b)  Don't include them as part of the HTML+ standard
            but suggest that browser writers provide continued
            support for them for for backwards compatibility.

I personally favour (b) as its cleaner.

    3)  Notes to Implementors

This section will be moved to an appendix and perhaps merged with suggestions
on backwards compatibility.

    4)  <P> as a container

In HTML this acts as a separator. In HTML+ it acts as a container for the text
FOLLOWING the <P> element. This allows authors to tag the paragraph's role
and to specify rendering hints, e.g. to indent the margins. It also allows
hypertext links to be anchored on whole paragraphs.

I propose to leave this part of the spec alone.

    5) Support for Annotations

It seems a neat idea to allow annotations to be held separately from
documents and later merged together. The PANEL element can already be used
for this purpose. I have added an IDREF attribute to the FIGT tag to allow
figure overlays to be also treated in this way.

To allow users to select an arbitrary part of a document for an annotation
I have added a new tag: NOTE with similar attributes to the CHANGED tag. This
would have to inserted into the document and then acts in a similar way to
the syntactically more restricted "A" tag.

I forsee the URL syntax for anchors being extended to allow specifying
character offsets from the start of the document (or a named element), and
perhaps also to permit pattern matching as a mechanism for gracefully coping
with minor changes to documents. Such extensions would allow arbitrary
annotations to made independently of whether suitable predefined anchors are
available in the document or not.

    6)  Error detection

How about an error tag? This could be detected even inside the EMBED element
since "<" characters are required to be escaped as per PRE. In theory one
could even cope with nested errors.

I propose to include this in the spec.

How does that sound?

No, this is a transport level problem which shouldn't affect the
document format at all.  Agreed, HTTP currently doesn't have a way to
tell normal EOF from an error, but HTTP+ will solve this problem and
then the transport will be able to tell the higher layers that an
error occurred.  Please don't mix layers!

I'd prefer a) so as to ensure that these tag's remain somewhat supported.

I feel that the <p> tag should remain just a indication to stuff in a blank
line at the current point, and use the <justify> tag to set alignment's and
such.

I was hoping someone would suggest this, was looking for something like it just

I can imagine that in real practice the use of the "logical" hints will be
scarce, while we'll see prolific use of the physical ones.  As someone who
has to actually create these documents by hand, its certainly nicer to type
singular tags, as well as see them close off nicely (same argument as the </>
for me here..) i.e.

<em b>This word is <em i>italic</em></em>

                vs.

<b>This word is <i>italic</i></b>

Anyone else feel the same way?  Or am I just looney? :)

I noticed this also as I was going over the document again.  It would be nice
if there were a <justify> tag instead of putting justify options inside the <p>
tag.  The <justify> tag shouldnt cause a paragraph break, for example:

<justify left>Left Justified<justify right>Right justified<p>

should produce:

Left Justified                                                  Right Justified

Granted, this is rather unlikely case, but it may be desired in some
situations.  In any case, the justification hints definatly shouldnt be part of
the paragraph break tag. (IMHO of course ;)

Id also like to suggest adding a "flush" option to the <justify> tag, that
presents nicely flushed text.  In conjunction with the <fig> tags, a magazine
style article could be represented almost identically in HTML as on paper.

I'm one of the loosers that creates html by hand. I have no trouble
understanding and writing <b>This word is <i>italic</i></b>
if there is a </em> tag then *I* would expect tho end any emphasis
and return to the normal font.
I know this implies that <em b><em i> hdhdh</em> isn't very nice from
a parsers viewpoint, but to end the correct em I would suggest using
<em b><em i> hdhdh</em i>still bold</em b>.

So my suggestion is to include a tag to end any emphasis and </em> seems
most logical to me. If you want to end only the italic emphasis use </em i>.
This means that <em b><em i>bold italic when possible</em></em> would be
wrong (there is one /em too many)

Note that this is just the way I *feel* things, not that I really want
that to happen.

I don't believe this is possible in SGML: the proper matching of <em>
and </em> must be done independently of any attributes, if I'm
correct.  (It certainly is easier for parsers that don't inspect the
attributes too carefully).

Subject: Re: HTML+ Comments
Status: RO


All,

Firstly, many thanks to Dave Ragett (and others) for taking on what must be 
an unenviable task.  Inevitably HTML+ is expected to be everything to all 
people and resolving conflicting requirements to everyones satisfaction is 
never easy.

I have a few comments to add to those that have gone before about the HTML+ 
DTD.  Some from my own experiences with writing DTD's.  I also had a browse
of the OSF DTD while writing this.  The HTML+ version I looked at was dated 
24 June 1993.

(The examples may be a bit wobbly - I havn't actually parsed them)

1  Given the simplicity of the current HTML DTD, is it necessary to "ensure 
   that most existing documents conform to HTML+"?  The task of mapping from 
   HTML to HTML+ should be pretty much the same whether or not HTML is a 
   subset of HTML+.

2  The paragraph tag as a container.  Great.  The trouble of having it as 
   a separator is that it becomes a formatting tag (stick an empty line in 
   here) rather than semantic markup (the text between the start and end 
   tags constitute a paragraph).  It initially caused me some confusion, 
   given that different formatters treated it in a different manner.

   The same comment (as noted by Klaus Harbo) apply to other EMPTY elements 
   which logically should have content.

3  Semantic markup using attributes - hmmmm!

   I appreciate the logic behind this decision, but I can't help thinking 
   its a bit of a kluge.  It _does_ mean that anybody can invent their own 
   "tag" and have a conformant document, but does nothing to ensure that it 
   will be rendered by a given viewer.  There will still be the need to 
   agree on a common set of elements (now transformed to attributes) and we 
   are back pretty much back to where we were before.

   Please, lets have the current list of <emph> types as elements in their 
   own right.

   In the same vein, could I suggest that <p> and <quote> are elements 
   "without style" and a separate element <note> carries a style attribute
   taking one of margin, caution, error (and maybe reviewer).

4  Given 1 above, how about introducing sections as containers rather than 
   H[1-6] being paragraph type elements - i.e.

      <!element section -- ( title?, (%main;)* ) >

   Nested sections then imply the level without the need for explicit tags.
   Would this be more difficult for clients to parse?

5  Formatting hints.  Given the option between a client supporting a wider 
   range of semantic markup and being about to tweek the format of individual 
   elements I know where I would put my money :-).

   If they are to be included however, it would make some sense to bung 
   them all into one entity to be included as an attribute for any element 
   that may require special formatting.

      <!ENTITY % inline-format
      "font   CDATA           #IMPLIED
       size   CDATA           #IMPLIED
       weight (bold | italic) #IMPLIED" >

      <!ENTITY % para-format
      "justify (left | centre | right)  #IMPLIED" >

   Superscript and subscript should be elements in their own right.

6  I cannot recall the reasons why line break and hard space were requested.
   Given that they are needed (I have a hard time with line break):

   - there is a character entity in the "ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Numeric and 
     Special Graphic//.." representing "no break (required) space".  (This 
     entity set is the one defining lt, gt and amp).  This would be more 
     appropriate than the <sp> element.
   - line break should be added as a processing instruction <?line-brk>, 
     which is exactly what it is.

7  QUOTE is permitted in the DD element without it being declared anywhere.  
   Why doesn't sgmls complain ?

8  Tables.  Dave asks if complex data should be allowed in table fields.  
   In principle I see no reason why not, but there are other things I'd 
   rather see implemented before supporting this.

9  The mailto URL.  (I know that it is not part of the DTD).  Maybe it 
   could be included as an element <mail> rather than a URL.  I think it 
   would make more sense - it sits awkwardly as a URL.

     <!ELEMENT mail - - ( #CDATA ) >
     <ATTLIST  mail
               address   CDATA   #REQUIRED >

   where address contains the fully-qualified Internet address.  Other 
   header fields could be added as attributes or elements.

10 Embedded data.  Would it be possible to use the SGML NOTATION construct.  
   In this way, any SGML conforming renderer would be able to process it 
   given the capability. E.g.

   <!NOTATION PS       SYSTEM>
   <!NOTATION PDF      SYSTEM>
   <!ELEMENT  EMBED    - - CDATA>
   <!ATTLIST  EMBED
              id       ID        #IMPLIED 
              notation NOTATION (PS|PDF) #IMPLIED >

   (I don't know if the mime types would be valid as notation types - I 
   can't find any info on whether NOTATION takes a defined set of values).

11 Tables, figures, examples etc. should have a display container.  Or am I     
   missing the point and this is the purpose of <panel> or <fig>?

   I was thinking of something like:

   <!ELEMENT DISPLAY - - ( title?, (fig | eqn | example | tbl)*, caption?).

11 Comments, marked sections etc.
   Given the (relative) complexity of this DTD it is likely that many people 
   (myself included) will resort to using an SGML editor if given half a 
   chance.  It is important therefore to support or tolerate as much of the 
   standard as is reasonably achievable.  This should include processing 
   instructions, comments, marked sections etc.

In case you skip read - most of these comments above revolve around ensuring 
HTML+ conform to the spirit of SGML:

- markup should wherever possible describe content not format,
- attributes qualify an element, not define its type or content,
- wherever possible physical form should be derived from the markup,
- use what SGML provides,

and some are just nigly points which go to show that I'm a pedantic bugger.

Right, now I'm off to hide for a few days :-)

Steve.

Why do I keep thinking we want the same thing? :-)

Yes, definately separate the retrieval from the indexing.
But how are you going to display the results of the search to the user?
In your example, if I search the database of faxes, I'd want to see a list 
of results like say

<LI><A HREF="...">Fax</A> from m.koster, 19 Jul 1993, 10K (Score 1000).

rather than just something like:

<LI><A HREF=".../fax_08932">fax_08932</A> (Score 1000)

Either you build a special server that generates this extra info on the fly,
or you need to generate it beforehand. The latter is far more general.
What I am after is how to best do it, preferably integrated in a HTP server.

Subject: Extentions to httpd
Status: RO

        I'm not sure if this is a html-related, or http-related, or what
exactly, but let me throw out some ideas I'm mulling over and see what
people think about them.  I'm relatively new to this game, so I may be
reinventing the wheel, or just making a wheel with a shape that doesn't
roll very well.

        This all started with problems getting gopher and www to interact
"properly".  We want to be able to do waisindex searches of html document
collections.  If we call gopher to do that (with a gopher://.... URL) we
get the search executed correctly but we're stuck in gopher-space, with no
way (that I can see) to get back to http-space.  Similar problems occur
with doing CSO searches.  I have to do them through gopher, and the various
clients have too much (to my mind) knowledge of what a CSO search is built
in to them.

        Anyway, this is my idea.  I want to hack httpd (I'm working from
NCSA's version 0.4) to allow executing external programs.  If a http URL
starts with a |, httpd would treat the rest of the URL string as a program
to execute and pipe the result back to the client.  Anything after a "?"
would be passed to the program as arguments.  Obviously, there are security
issues to be resolved here; you can't allow people to just execute anything
on your system, but that's a detail to be worked out.

        Here's an example:

        Let's say I want to set up a waisindex search.  I put the following
somewhere in a html file:

        <A HREF="http://myhost.mydomain/|wwwbin/">Microbiology</A>

        The wwwbin program looks at its arguments.  If there are none, it
emits something like:

        <isindex>
        <H1>Please enter a keyword to be used for searching</H1>

        If wwwbin has arguments (i.e. the stuff after the "?"), it uses
those arguments to execute the search and sends back a page of html
containing the results.

        Does this seem like a reasonable approach?  It involves hacking the
server slightly, but it requires no changes to any client.  It also allows
me to easily customize how a search looks by just altering some external
program (which could very well be a shell script).  My initial complaint
that got me thinking along these lines what the XMosaic has the format of a
CSO search page built in.  With my scheme, you can tear all that out of
XMosaic, and put it in the server side, allowing the database administrator
to determine what it looks like (for example, I might want to include some
explanitory note, warning, copyright notice, etc).

I don't understand why there is this foregone conclusion that PDF will
not support structure.  I went to the announcement and spoke to the
product development manager and both the announcement and the individual
said that SGML structure would be incorporated into PDF.

Granted, it might not be there today, but I think that the PDF format
has more going for it right now than HTML (or HTML+).  At least it has
the prospect of becoming as ubiquitous as PostScript :-)

There are many other concerns related to document interchange than those
being addresss by the WWW community.  The presentation of the document
is paramount to many publishers and they would not consider the use of
something like HTML/+ to distribute their publications.  Many are moving
to SGML, but their DTD's will differ among both publications and issues
(as the DTD matures) and PDF at least offers the hope of being able to
distribute an electronic version of the document w/o the loss of the
presentation or the structural information.

Now, this is only my $0.02, and I haven't read the PDF book (yet).  But
my contacts in the publishing field look at PDF with great expectations
and are definitely considering it as a potential solution.

Kevin,

You made the point,

I agree with you -- from the point of view of architecture, why  
should PDF be a special case.

But consider my point of view as an information provider. Suppose I  
have a book that contains text and drawings. I'd like to distribute a  
hypertext version of the book. I'd like to know that the format I  
pick for my drawings can be read by most (or all) WWW browsers. PDF  
might be that format, for the reasons I outlined earlier. Is there a  
better format to use as a default?

Furthermore, as an information provider, I want to distribute only  
one version of my book. I can distribute a single PDF file with  
assurance that any Mac or Windows user can read the document (and DOS  
and UNIX users too, when Adobe achieves its promises). (This begs the  
question, "will Acrobat catch on" -- but anyone can buy an Acrobat  
reader in an Egghead Software store for $40 and I'm willing to take  
that chance).

Suppose the first page of the book said...

"If you have a WWW browser and an Internet connection, click here for  
a more current version of this book (across the net). If you are  
using an Adobe PDF reader, click here to learn more about WWW and the  
Internet (information in this local file)."

If the PDF link annotation were extended to accomodate URL/URNs, and  
the user's WWW browser read PDF files, the user could bounce to a  
newer (and structured) HTML version of the book. If they can't, well,  
I'm still assured they can read the version they've got and maybe  
they'll get web-happy later.

As an information provider, I want to be assured the format of the  
files I distribute can be read by as many people as possible. I'm not  
going to be distributing the majority of my books across the net  
(that would limit my market for now). But I'd like to offer the  
advantages of the Web's Internet hyperlinks to readers who can use  
them. Of course, PDF ability doesn't have to built into every WWW  
browser for this. I can hope some WWW browsers are installed with PDF  
viewers as linked applications. But that still leaves me with the  
problem of not knowing if I've picked a format that can read by most  
WWW users. So I'd prefer to see native support for PDF in WWW  
broswsers.

Of course, we need to recognize that this is wildly speculative right  
now. I don't know that a WWW browser can accomodate PDF and I don't  
know that Adobe would accept a proposal to extend the PDF link  
annotation specification. But it's worth exploring.

Regards,
Daniel

I really do have to agree with this.  HTML is the kind of thing that can
only be loved by a computer scientist.  Yes, it expresses the underlying
structure of a document, but documents are more than just structured text
databases; they have visual impact.  HTML totally eliminates any visual
creativity that a document's designer might have.  Sort of like newspeak. 
Saying "This text file doubleplus unpretty.  Leave, redo, return when
complete" may get the message accross, but it hardly has the flair and
nuance of "This document looks like shit -- get out of here and don't come
back until it's completely redone!"

OK, here's (IMHO) a better way to do this.  Better because it takes
the output of the executable and still applies all the stream
processing/filtering/formatting.  I also chose to flag things using a
trailing "!" instead of ".search", but this is easily enough changed.

By retaining the stream processing, I can do things like have a
``script.txt'' executable, and have the server stick in the
<PLAINTEXT> for me.  As more filter/converters get written into the
daemon, I can take advantage of all those simply by identifying the
nature of the executable's output via the suffix.

I highly recommend having a ``fail *!'' at the top of the rules file,
and then selectively mapping various nodes to ``whatever!'' to prevent
folks from trying to execute arbitrary docs as executables.

One detail: the code as exists treats the ?* search parameters as not
a part of the node, so the parameters are not normally passed any
deeper than HTRetrieve().  My unsightly hack is to point a global at
them so that they can be accessed deep inside HTLoadFile().  They also
simply could have been passed on down as part of the node address but
it seemed to me that violated the intent of the address parameter.

enjoy!

Very sexy :)  What (ideally) I'd like to do is to be able to specify,
in /etc/httpd.conf is
	SEARCH	file:/home.html	/usr/local/bin/www/search-home-page
	SEARCH  file:/*.html /usr/local/bin/www/search-this-page

Specify what the search program is for each page.  Then, when it comes
time to fork and exec, the argv[0] of the search process is set to the
page that it would have been searching (/usr/local/www/home.html for
eg).

Nevertheless, I think your solution of using the extension of the
executable to specify the data returned is rather elegant.  I hope
CERN are taking notes :)

}-- End of excerpt from Roy Smith

We're a publisher planning to distribute documents in HTML/HTML+.
I agree that there are presentation concerns that publishers have
because that is one aspect of a document where they add value 
to information.  I don't want to lose that ability, but I also
want to do new things.  I might like the ability to control
presentation for an individual document in WWW, but I'm happy
that I have more control than I do in gopher. Small steps.
 
As a publisher, I want to be able to distribute information 
as best I can to people on lots of different computers using tools
that they choose.  Delivery of information is paramount, in my
opinion.  If you want to receive my document on a VT100 document,
I want to be able to send it to you.  If I can show it to you
in Mosaic, and take advantage of a graphics display, then you
will recognize greater value in that form of presentation.  You
might recognize that we had designers involved in creating
that presentation.  Our designers are anxious to have more
tools to create more interesting, effective documents, so, sure,
they are concerned about presentation. 

SGML actually serves the needs of publishers quite well. 
Even in HTML, I can create one file and allow users of Xmosaic
and users of lynx on a vt100 can retrieve the same document.
It makes sense in both environments.  SGML isn't the single
solution to all the world's problems, but it makes some useful
distinctions.  I wish that
there were better tools available for SGML and I wish that we had standard
ways to represent formatting information.  Publishers are divided
over PostScript or SGML, and they are different ends of the spectrum.
I'm in the SGML camp because I want to reuse my information in
different forms and with different technologies.  I want browsers
to be able to process and manage the information, not just display it.

Let's look at WWW as a system and ask where it makes sense to introduce
a mechanism that aids in controlling presentation.  Don't assume that HTML must
provide it.  Don't assume that we need absolute control.
We have proposed a style 
sheet mechanism for consideration and believe that it offers a good way to map
formatting attributes to structural elements. I think it is better
to regard formatting info as instructions that can be interpreted with
some lattitude by the browser to achieve the best results.

I'd like to see more discussion of how to control presentation.  If
you junk SGML, you will lose more than you gain.  I have no problems
with supporting additional formats, such as PDF, if there's a good
PD implementation.  I don't think too many of us would be keen on
paying Adobe large sums to use its electronic xerox machine.

How about a decompression system ... when stat() fails on ``file'',
look for ``file.gz'' and ``file.z'' and ``file.Z'' and ``file.f'',
etc, and decompress as needed.  That way once I have an area static, I
can gzip the lot and save on diskspace (no, whatever makes you think
that I'm referring to the thesaurus and CIA world-fact-book? :-).

If the client says they know about x-gzip or whatever the MIME
incantation is for ``I've got decompression nous'', then the
decompression doesn't have to be performed.  Sound reasonable?  If you
think so, write your name and your idea of this week's mystery guest

idea, implement it and send it to CERN.

I'm sure I wasn't the first to suggest something like this, though I
helped spark off a  discussion a few weeks ago. I would really like
HTML to be able to format poetic verse and postal addresses nicely. I
also like the idea of semantic markup, and the last thing I want is
something which will be used to undermine this essential feature of HTML.

The line layout of a poem or a postal address is semantic information.
Poems are that way because they are poems. You could get a haiku on to
a single line of a browser by separating / the lines with / slashes, but

  I think that
  this looks 
  much better

(before any flames me, no, it's not a haiku, I can't be bothered to compose one)

Likewise, a postal address is laid out like it is because each line
represents a yet more general indication of location. That is semantic
information. I prefer it on separate lines. Others may want (or may be
forced) to reduce it to one line, but that's their (or their browser's)
choice. My address at the bottom of this email is a mixture, with the
last sections comma separated to keep the whole thing within 4 lines. I
don't regard that as correct; it's a compromise, and the kind of thing
that a HTML browser might be configuerd to do.

Suggesting markup in terms of a line break seemed like a better idea
(at the time), than requesting specific types of layout each with their
own tag, since HTML would then grow as everyone wanted their own
favourite e.g. <poem>, <postal_address>, <british_rail_timetable>, etc.
In hindsight, the term "break" was a bad one to use; I appreciate why
many people object to it.

So, in the light of recent discussion and the change to the <p> tag,
may I suggest that, if <p> is encloses paragraphs, we define values
which describe the nature of the paragraph (e.g <p postal> or <p
poem>), and then permits appropriate markup within the paragraph - such
as line breaks. That, or a variation on <pre> so that newlines in the
source HTML are still respected, but text displayed proportionally,
rather than mono- spaced. I suggested the latter to Dave Raggett some
time ago, but the former feels more semantically "right" to me. As long
as something along these lines can be done, I'm very happy to live
without a line break tag, entity, instruction or whatever.

Pthptt !!

I would agree with the statement that many publishers would not consider the 
use of HTML or HTML+ - it may not be sophisticated enough for their 
requirements in terms of the elements it contains.

But don't confuse that statement with Marcs assertion that this applies 
equally to SGML.  SGML allows you to define _any_ DTD - HTML is a specific 
DTD designed for the WWW project.

SGML was designed specifically for publishers.  It allows you as much 
flexibility as you want in determining the presentation style of a document. 
If necessary, processing instructions can be added to a document, the 
NOTATION construct allows embedded data of other types and by abstracting 
the information about formatting of elements, you can display it 101 
different ways if thats what you want.

It certainly does appeal to computer scientists because of the power of 
the idea.  In a project I am working on, we are using one source document 
coded using SGML to provide online documentation, printed documentation 
(several versions - reference manual, quick reference card etc), context 
sensitive help for a GUI, and the program the SGML document documents even 
reads the SGML itself to check information about input parameters.  Do that 
with PostScript or PDF :-)

Just a quick note to y'all out there -- I hope that no one confuses my
particular prejudices with where Mosaic's going to go -- we will
definitely do HTML+, no sweat.

Meanwhile, I think we oughta collectively buy Dave Raggett a beer for
his excellent work on the HTML+ spec.  (Hmmm, he won't be in

Yes, in theory, but there will be large amounts of manually created HTML
which omits this element.

I think that (b) keeps the spec clean, while providing practical advice
to browser writers, so that browsers will be able to work with both
formats or a mixture of the two, at least for the short term.

It has been implicit in the converstions over the past few weeks that 
one goal of HTML is to keep it small wrt the number of elements it contains.

It may seem like a daft question, but what is the justification for this.  
I can think of a few things that may have gone unsaid:

 - bigger equals more difficult to understand,
 - bigger means more difficult to implement conforming clients/editors,
 - small is beautiful.

There are a number of design guidelines mentioned in the HTML+ DTD - the only 
one that seems to be relevant is 

"Fast and easy to render with modest programs ...."

Comments anybody?

Steve.

Well, while we're on personal feelings.

I truly believe (yes, I'm computer person, if not really a scientist)
that the last people who should have the final say on the technical
document presentation are technical publishers. This applies to paper
and electronic versions. I really, really wish that the majority of the
technical docs I see had even a tenth of the strcuture of most of the
HTML around. I'd like to be able to change font sizes to what I need
(if my sight is not good, I need large print), not what someone has
decided I should have, and I want document layout to change
intelligently to suite me. Me, me, me, I, I, I. You want two or three
columns? I don't, I find it bloody irritating seeing lots of words
hyphenated; don't force me to read your doc that way.

While it may be argued that non-technical documents really does need a
human touch, the HTML policy of semantic markup is definitely what this
reader wants to see.

Many thanks Steve for your lengthy comments. Have you seen the draft RFC
for HTML+ ? This is available at:

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/htmlplus.ps

> 1  Given the simplicity of the current HTML DTD, is it necessary to "ensure 
>    that most existing documents conform to HTML+"?  The task of mapping from 
>   HTML to HTML+ should be pretty much the same whether or not HTML is a 
>    subset of HTML+.

I don't think its necessary. HTML+ browsers could easily include support for
the HTML tags that aren't present in HTML+ itself. This would make browsers
robust in the absence of the DOCTYPE element, even for documents which mix
the two formats.

> 2  The paragraph tag as a container.  Great.

I have specified it as a container, even though it doesn't (and mustn't) have
an end tag. The scope of <P> is delimited by any element which is not given
by the entity definition %text; e.g. headers, lists, tables, figures, ...

>   The same comment (as noted by Klaus Harbo) apply to other EMPTY elements 
>   which logically should have content.

Virtually all elements in HTML+ have content.

> 3  Semantic markup using attributes - hmmmm!

>    I appreciate the logic behind this decision, but I can't help thinking 
>    its a bit of a kluge.  It _does_ mean that anybody can invent their own 
>    "tag" and have a conformant document, but does nothing to ensure that it 
>    will be rendered by a given viewer.  There will still be the need to

>    are back pretty much back to where we were before.

You are right in saying that "anybody can invent their own 'tag' and have a
conformant document", but wrong in assuming that viewer's can't render it
effectively. There is always a valid default for rending emphasis and
paragraphs etc. Authors can also include rendering hints which are
deliberately independent of the role for this very purpose.

>   Please, lets have the current list of <emph> types as elements in their 
>   own right.

Doing this would lead us back to the pressure for continual extension as
people find the current set too restrictive for their needs. The role
mechanism is designed to avoid this trap.

> 4  Given 1 above, how about introducing sections as containers rather than 
>    H[1-6] being paragraph type elements - i.e.

>      <!element section -- ( title?, (%main;)* ) >

The GROUP tag was designed to cover this need.

>   Nested sections then imply the level without the need for explicit tags.
>   Would this be more difficult for clients to parse?

Deriving the level automatically is considered as being too expensive,
particularly when a document might span across a number of nodes (retrievable
chunks - i.e. files).

> 5  Formatting hints.  Given the option between a client supporting a wider 
>    range of semantic markup and being about to tweek the format of
>    individual elements I know where I would put my money :-).

But what about semantic markup needs yet to be identified? The HTML+ role
attribute is intended to allow the format to be kept simple while allowing
novel roles as yet unforeseen. Commonly accepted roles should be registered
to encourage standard useage.

>   If they are to be included however, it would make some sense to bung 
>   them all into one entity to be included as an attribute for any element 
>   that may require special formatting.

This was considered but didn't seem worthwhile.

>   Superscript and subscript should be elements in their own right.

Why make a special case for these?

> 6  I cannot recall the reasons why line break and hard space were requested. 

Line breaks often have semantic significance, e.g. in poetry or in quoting
parts of old manuscripts for which the rerences are to given line numbers.

Hard spaces are needed since there is no way for browsers to deduce which
spaces mustn't be broken.

>   - there is a character entity in the "ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Numeric and

>     appropriate than the <sp> element.

That sounds good to me. As you can see in the RFC, I have used character
entities for em and en dashes. Do you know the appropriate entity names for
all of these?

>   - line break should be added as a processing instruction <?line-brk>, 
>     which is exactly what it is.

See previous explanation.

> 7  QUOTE is permitted in the DD element without it being declared anywhere.

My mistake! Thanks for spotting this. (I wished sgmls had complained)

I have recently extended tables to also allow <P>, headers and lists.

The mailto URL is gaining favour and I see no good reason not to support it.
The FORM tag does indeed allow you to include RFC 822 headers, see the MH tag.

Mime content types can have attributes themselves. How would this fit with
the NOTATION mechanism?

FIG includes support for captions etc. PANEL behaves in much the same way as

I expect most people will use public domain WYSIWYG editors designed for HTML+
itself. A half way house uses menus/toolbar to insert the markup, which
otherwise remains visible - the Emacs editor for HTML works this way.

Browsers should already support <!-- comments >.

Agreed.

Generally true, but look at the ISO DTD's. They show the results of
sticking to this policy - there are huge numbers of elements. Whereas
HTML+ is designed as a lightweight flexible format.

> - wherever possible physical form should be derived from the markup,

Yes, but don't forget user preferences.

HTML and HTML+ both support the <TITLE> ... </TITLE> element. It is used to
define the title for the current document. HTML's ADDRESS tag can be used
for a byline for the current document. HTML+ does it a little differently
via paragraph roles:  <P ROLE="Bbyline">.

When you want to markup the author/title for a cited work, then HTML+
expects you to use the EM tag:

        <em role="cite"> a citation </em>
        <em role="author"> the author's name </em>
        <em role="title"> title of cited work </em>

You can also nest these to bracket the author and title as belonging to the
same citation.

This scheme is extendable so that you can define novel roles for classifying
other types of information. Browsers will normally show all text within the
EM element in italics, but you can override this with rendering hints.

I would very much like to know how well HTML+ matches your requirements
and what areas would cause you difficulties.

Good in principle, but unfortunately, HTTP 1.0 only passes control information
at the start of data transfer - there isn't a way of intermixing control
and data and subsequently separating them. FTP gets around this problem by
using separate links for control and data.

I think we should consider a transport escaping mechanism for embedding
control info into the data stream. My suggestion for <error> ... </error>
would allow this for HTML/HTML+ and could be stripped out of the data stream
before it gets displayed.

Last I heard, how precisely to incorporate compression into MIME
wasn't well defined (hence all the x-types.)  Dunno how soon that'll
change.

It seems likely to me that you'll want to wait on using such a feature
much until the majority of users can receive compressed files directly
(i.e. xmosaic goes HTTP/1.0) unless your server has little disk space
and tons of free CPU.

I wish I could resist this one, but...

The real semantic markup for a Peter's not-really-a-haiku would be

<haiku><first-haiku-line>I think
that</first-haiku-line><second-haiku-line>this
looks</second-haiku-line><third-haiku-line>much
better</third-haiku-line></haiku>

This pleading for hard line breaks is all nonsense, special pleading to
allow just this one oh-so-necessary bit of procedural markup.  This
slippery slope leads to Postscript!!!

(Ah, that feels better :-)#

That being said, Peter's suggestion to allow <p poem>, etc., sounds
quite reasonable to me.  It should be clear, though, that no special
handling of line breaks within such a markup is promised, but that
browsers that know the meaning of the paragraph modifiers may "do the
right thing".

Subject: Hello World.PDF
Cc: Paul Holbrook <holbrook@cic.net>, uri@bunyip.com
Status: RO

Below is a PDF file I created on a Macintosh. I did this because many
people probably haven't seen the heart of the PDF beast yet ;> It doesn't
get much simpler. All the file contained was "Hello World" without the
quotes to be printed on an 8.5" x 11" page. I made the typeface Courier, so
that the PDF file wouldn't contain lots of font metric information, if I
would have used a TrueType font the file would have been much larger (about
2500 bytes for a scaleable font like TrueType Geneva). The point here is
that PDF is not simple, it is like a PostScript superset, oriented towards
presentation, not content. The files are fairly large; in this example the
11 characters of Hello World turned into a 942 character PDF file, almost
100 times larger than the original, of course I didn't use the LZW encoding
for the text :). Like PostScript, this is not very human readable.

There has been a lot of excitement lately about Adobe's PDF. While I
welcome PDF as a replacement for the distribution of many PostScript
documents, PDF has a lot of shortcomings, it is not a panacea. It certainly
doesn't address most of the issues in WWW. A PostScript file (.ps) requires
a PostScript printer in order to view the file; GhostScript doesn't work
for many complex documents, doesn't address PostScript Level 2, etc. PDF
ups the requirements, it requires that you have a PDF viewer, which is not
free and the viewer can't be attached to the document itself. Simply having
a PostScript printer does you no good since PDF is not valid PostScript and
requires a PDF reader to view or print the file. Adobe has stated that they
won't distribute a "Print Only" PDF reader for free and no vendor has
announced intentions of bundling Acrobat that I know of. Version 1.0 does
not address the issue of modifying documents, you simply create read only
PDF documents, which may contain separate annotations. Links are confined
within documents, so a HyperText system isn't currently possible.

Acrobat is available on the Mac OS (6.0.5 and later) and Windows 3.1, some
Unix versions are on the way, everyone else is out of luck, so much for the
"portable" part of PDF. In addition, use of the Distiller which is
necessary for PostScript files and output from many Desktop Publishing
programs (or other applications that use embedded PostScript) is extremely
slow and a memory hog (12MB of application RAM is recommended).

Acrobat and PDF do not address the issues of workgroup collaboration, Web
style HyperText, or accessing document types other than PDF. Acrobat is one
solution to read only publication of material for CD-ROM or one of the
phone/cable services coming soon to a wall jack near you. Adobe hopes you
will standardize on PDF and electronic exchange of information instead of
using FAX or Fed Ex or making paper copies of documents for your
co-workers; the Acrobat reader is cheaper over time than the reams of paper
you would normally print, fax, and copy, assuming you view on screen rather
than printing. I'm sure many big organizations will use Acrobat (I know I
will for some distribution), but if PDF and Acrobat addressed even half of
the issues I'm concerned with for information sharing and collaboration I
probably wouldn't be on this mailing list today.

Sorry for such a long message, but there was a lot to share.

Excuse me, but I could not let this one pass. The most common problem by far
with documents failing to work with Ghostscript (or any other interpreter) has
nothing whatsoever to do with any Ghostscript shortcomings -- it is instead a
direct result of either poor quality PostScript production or bad handling of
the resulting PostScript data stream.

The number of PostScript applications which produce output that will only work
on one specific sort of printer is staggering. The PostScript specifications
outline in considerable detail what is printer and transport-specific and what
is not, yet applications continue to produce PostScript which uses bizarre
printer-specific features for absolutely no reason. Such problems are not
limited to LaserWriter-specific usage either: I've seen LaserJet-specific
output, DEC PrintServer-specific output, and many other variants.

Garbage in the data stream is also a common problem. PostScript is pure binary
data, really, yet it looks so much like text that many people treat it as text.
This leads to big problems in some cases. Applications also get confused about
what things are truly part of PostScript and what are just an artefact of the
transport (like CTRL/D). This leads to a wide variety of problems.

In the old days the big problem was whether or not your printer has the right
fonts available. But this has dwindled into insignificance now that almost all
interpreters have all the common fonts. The remaining problems are almost
always related to printer specifics and stream corruption.

So what about Ghostscript? Its support of the full PostScript language is the
best I have found anywhere. (A recent comparison of several interpreters on
lots of sample inputs found that Ghostscript was the only interpreter tested
that fully conformed to the specifications in all cases. It was also the
fastest interpreter in most of the tests.) Ghostscript supports all the fonts
people have come to expect. Ghostscript also supports quite a few Level II
features now and full support should be in place by the end of the year. (I
have yet to see widespread enough usage of Level II to make this an issue
anyway.) It also provide emulation features that eliminate many of the problems
with printer-specific usage; features which practically every other interpreter
does not have.

I speak as someone who spent 5 years doing diagnostic work that often included
troubleshooting document printing problems. I have subsequently spent an
additional 3 years supporting a product that includes PostScript interpreter
functionality that is based on Ghostscript.

I should also point out that I have nothing to do with writing Ghostscript -- I
speak only as a *very* satisfied customer.

Gateway WWW - Oraperl for Plexus 2.2
====================================

Characteristics
+++++++++++++++

 o only the condition of the WHERE clause is required in the search text 
 o links to other queries can be made.  
 o multiple styles (glossaries, lists, plaintext, ...) 
 o queries to multiple databases are possible.  
 o only the server knows the access details for the database (database name,
   username, password).  
 o no modifications for the clients, only the server is upgraded.  
 o URL of the document must begin by "/oracle".  

Syntax
++++++

 o With each document (suffix ".html") is associated a file with suffix ".sql".
   This file defines the format of the output to be returned.  The file contains
   HTML text with possible keywords : 
    o <unesc> condition of the WHERE clause (HTUnEscape) 
    o <esc> encoded condition (HTEscape) 
    o tag <sql "file"> where "file" is the pathname of an oraperl script.  

   The macros <unesc> and <esc> are replaced by the search text entered by the
   user in escaped (URL) or unescaped (as typed) form.

 o the oraperl script can define: 
    o "format STDOUT = ..." this format is used to display the returned
      values.  Columns of the SELECT clause, are specified by variable
      "@column" (or "$column[0], $column[1], ...) 
    o "format STDOUT_TOP = ..." (optionnal) 
    o "$statement" : this variable define the SELECT clause.  It can have
      one, or many, keywords "<unesc>", each used for the condition of the
      WHERE clause.  
    o "$database" : database name (default 'A') 
    o "$username" : oracle username (default "SCOTT") 
    o "$password" : password (default "TIGER") 
    o "$maxselect" : maximum number of returned row (default 40).  
    o it must have the following line : 

      require "server/oracle_search.pl";

Subject: Search keyword dialog box in Mosaic 2.0pre0?
Status: RO


	Having to go through the extra step of opening the dialog box
before typing in a keyword seems a bit extraneous to me. How about keeping
the old field style but only having it appear when the document requires
it (like the way the horizontal scroll bar appears)? What does everyone else

Full Approval!

I also really miss highlighting of keywords in the found text.  This
feature is present in xwais and xgopher and is the main reason for me
that I still use xwais.

At the moment it is very awkward to find the relevant parts of
retrieved documents. You have to popup the other search box and fill in
again your keywords one by one. A first step could be to supply a
default for the second search box where the default could be the first
keyword from the first search.

Arnold

P.S.: 	My mosaic-sun (binary from ncsa) version of Mosaic 2.0pre0 crashes
	when I try to print in postscript format.

I agree.  I have some applications that make heavy use of the search
keyword feature.  It is already a problem for many users that the mouse
must be inside the small search keyword box for type-in.

I would prefer the old style, and it would help if all type-in to the
document area is directed into the keyword box.  I am willing to lose
the menu keyboard short-cuts.

This might more properly be a server function than a client one.
Depending on the server, there is no guarantee how the "keywords" used
to find the document correspond to any words in the document.

I can image a server marking up the document with some appropriate
highlight emphasis tags around the matching keywords.  This would have
an advantage in cases where the server does sophisticated stemming,
etc, of search keywords.

A problem is that due to the stateless nature of HTTP, the server
usually does not have the context to remember what the search keywords
were when the document is retrieved.  The only way I can see around
this is to encode some of the context into the URLs returned by the
search (yuck?).  For example:

	http://server:80/database?word1+word2

might return a list containing:

	http://server:80/database/doc3458?word1+word2
	http://server:80/database/doc8754?word1+word2
	http://server:80/database/doc9235?word1+word2

and in turn, retrieving the docs using the above URLs would result in a
copy with the search words appropriately highlighted.

Just an idea.  Comments?

Me too.  I find having to make sure the mouse is in the search box to be a
major pain and annoyance.  And, I never use the menu shortcuts, so I
wouldn't miss them if they went away, if that's what it took to fix the
mouse-in-search-box problem.

When I run X_Moxaic, it's under Mac-X on a Macintosh.  This may color my
view of the world slightly, since the X and Mac user interfaces have some
culture clash built in.  To be perfectly honest, when a good native Mac WWW
client becomes available, I'll probably stop using X-Mosaic completely.

Seconded (thirded?, fourthed?). The essential features should be;

Don't waste screen area when no search term is needed.
Make it OBVIOUS to the user that a search keyword is needed when it is.
Don't obscure the MIDDLE page with a dialog box (like Cello does)
Don't Require the user to do anything extra.

I also support the idea of directing all keyboard to the search box.
This has caused problems to naive users here, though it wouldn't be too
bad if the input are was highlighted more obviously.

 you are in luck! xmosaic prerelaese 2.0pre0 includes images support
for postscript. There seems to be a bug in that code that makes it dumps
core on a sun. (but that's why it is a pre release :-)

If someone can send me dbx output of where that happens I will look into it

Hmm, I sort of agree with you but I don't want to lose the keyboard
short-cuts.  Some heavy UI thinking needs to be done to make this work
right.  Having a short-cut ('/' maybe though I wish that were search) that
warps the mouse in to the keyword field would be ok with me.  Note also
that NCSA Mosaic does have:

warpPointerForIndex: Boolean 
   If true, the pointer will be warped to the keyword entry area when accessing a
   searchable document.  (Since NCSA Mosaic is point-to-focus, this automatically
   gives input focus for searchable documents.) Default is false.  

(which can be annoying sometimes so I don't think it's the right solution
but it's nice as an option)

Also, I agree with a previous comment about having words highlighted that
appear in the "search keyword" box.  I sort of believe this is the
responsibility of the server though because the data in arbitrary
and the browser wouldn't always get it right.  This means we need a
new style <EMPH TYPE="keyword"> that means this is only important
as the result of a search.

It does seem odd to have two search dialogs and I would be interested
in efforts to unify them.

Maybe a group can splinter off and brainstorm some at the Workshop
about how to do the UI for these features.

The UCSTRI does this, although not in an extremely elegant fashion.
It tends to look a little funny, because Xmosaic will wrap in the
middle of words if emphasis changes (e.g. if I have

   <STRONG>Algori</STRONG>thms

it may wrap in the middle of the word.  I'm guessing this is a Motif
text bug?

I agree that it's a server function rather than a client one, in
general.

I think it is a very good design. When I have used the search field for
the first time I don't dismiss it, I throws it to the back, iconify it or
just move it out of the way. When I need it again I already have it there.

This is indeed not an argument for having the search field in a dialog box,
merely my disagreeing with it being a disadvantage.

The advantage of the new design is, the way I use it, that you can move it
to a place were it easily accessible. I often use XMosaic spanning from the
top to the bottom of the screen. When searching indexes you sometime, if
you're lucky, only get a few hits. These are at the top of the screen while
the cursor is at the bottom and you have to move it around more when clicking
and entering search-terms.

Generally, I like to be able to move things around to where I want them.

Finally I think that the NCSA XMosaic team are doing a great job! I wish you
all the luck!

I would prefer to have the keyboard short-cuts rather than simpler keyword
input.

Maybe this could be made optional? A resource named somthing like
XMosaic*keywordsThroughDocArea:		{true|false}

When true all keyboard short-cuts are turned off.

Just an idea.

I think having a separate dialog box for searching is a good idea.
Removing the special 1 line entry box is the right step along the path
to more general form input.

If one is doing a lot of keyword entry, they can move the dialog box
to an appropriate place on their screen and leave it there, so the
interface can be similar to the 1.x one.

I also like the "forward reference" feature of 2.0 where you can see
the URLs of anchors in documents as you move the mouse over them.

Since several people are now working on projects for Plexus I would like
to have everyone doing so send me a short note about what you are working
on and what state it's in and when you expect it to be available for public
consumption (if ever).  Even if what you have done is only useful at your
site it would be helpful to know what you have in case someone is working
on something similar.

I'll summerize it, post back to www-talk and include it in the next release
(which probably will not be for several months since 2.2.1 looks fairly
stable).  This will also end up on the Web of course.

Pointers to the service, source, and docs are helpful also.

If it is enough to get the image printed outside its context, the file
could be fetched via XMosaic to an extern viewer and printed or saved
and then printed.

To give an example of this there is, in the document
http://www.luth.se/index.html (also name http://www.luth.se/)
a refence lookin like this:
<IMG SRC="/luth/logo.gif"> (line 7, second line in the body)
If you do an explicit 'open' in XMosaic and then enters the URL:
http://www.luth.se/luth/logo.gif
XMosaic starts your gif-viewer (xv is default) with the image.

If a document that has, for example, the URL:
http://www.some.address/path/more_path/document.html
and contains a refence looking like:
<IMG SRC="pics/gif/illustration.gif">
The address to give XMosaic to fetch this direct would be, as the
SRC-specification is relative the containing documents path:
http://www.some.address/path/more_path/pics/gif/illustration.gif"

I hope I covered the essentials, if anyone thinks otherwise I happily
accepts careful flaming (-:

The method suggested should be fine. It should also be possible to use a tool,
such as xv to grab the contents of the Mosaic window, and 
thus get a representation of it, if that is required. 
I expect that eventually details like this will be sorted out by the 
developers, so that the "whole" document page can be printed.

I want the old situation back: the space at the bottom reserved for
the search keyword.  I think that showing the URL of each anchor as
the mouse hovers above it is overkill and might even confuse novice
users ("what are all these strings of computerese appearing at the
bottom at random times?").  My preference (which I expressed before
:-) would be to take 3rd mouse click in an anchor as a command that
pops up a little dialog showing as much about the anchor.  Maybe, once
asynchronous interruptable IO is possible, this dialog could also try
to ping the server and ask whether the link is actually valid.  I'd
also like to see other stuff that the client happens to know about the
link, e.g. whether it has cached the data and whether it's in the
hotlist or in the global history...  (Where have I heard this before?)

In general it seems not a good idea to use a 3rd mouse button in portable
software (There are even computers with only one mouse button)

Subject: Annotation support
Status: RO

Support for Annotations is not (as far as I know) part of the current HTML
 standard, since
   it is not really a property of the source text, but rather of the Browser. I
 notice that
   NCSA's Mosaic is currently providing private annotations, and is about to
 provide group
   and public annotations. This is a good idea, although the annotations are on
 a "per Window"
   basis, which may not be ideal - it could be better if the annotations are
 linked more closely
   to sections of text - perhaps by having "annotation anchors" in the margin,
 which link
   to the annotation text

   There is an additional problem with annotations, not addressed in Mosaic's
 implementation, since
   it may be desirable to allow annotations on annotations! I do not believe
 that Mosaic does this.

I am aware of some systems which provide support for annotations, though not for
 HTML documents -
   for example the MUCH system developed by Roy Rada at Liverpool, and designed
 for asynchronous local
   development of text, does have annotation support.

However, although it might appear that annotations are "simply" a property of
 the Browser - the
   problem does not end there. The way NCSA have done it is to provide
 annotation servers - this then
   raises the possibility of different Browsers using the same annotation
 server. This would be
   beneficial to many users, since there would then be no requirement to adopt a
 particular browser
   package - for example I could communicate using Mosaic on my Unix system, and
 someone else could
   annotate my text using Cello on an IBM PC etc.

It seems to me that there is a need for consideration of annotation services,
 and how to provide them.

I think this is an issue which needs wider discussion - if it has not had it
 already.

They sure do, direct your XMosaic to annotation server
hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001 and look at
URL="http://www.mit.edu:8001/"
There you will find a hierarchy of annotations.

Personally I find it distracting for urls to flash at the bottom of the 
window as I move the mouse across the text area.  Its useful though to 
be able to find out quickly where the anchor goes without having to open 
the document source window.

As the Xmosaic uses Motif it is appropriate to follow the Motif style guide 
which states that the third mouse button should be used for application
specific functionality.  (The style guide assumes a three-button mouse.)

Thanks,

Status: RO

In the current version of Mosaic it is possible to Mail a document page to
another user.

It would be useful to be able to mail to a user, having selected an anchor from
the text


For example:-


   For further information please contact 
   
	Dr P Smith, The Rectory, XYZ University, <p>
	Telephone: 801-4367 <p>
	email id : psmith@xyz.ac.uk <p>
        
        <a mail="psmith@xyz.ac.uk : REF page #1234:DEFAULT-TEXT returnmsg1"> MAIL NOW </a>

The reference would be given to enable the intended recipient to remove his/her name
from a document which caused a large volume of unwanted mail to be generated.

User activation of the anchor would cause a suitable MAIL COMPOSE window to pop
up, possibly including a default message for filling in by the respondent - which could
of course be held in a separate file with its own URL.

Ideas like this may bave been discussed before - they would sure be useful.

(Of course in the future, telephone dialling could be included also!)

Status: RO

For those of you off to Cambridge for the workshop, there is a revised
version (dated 23rd July) of the HTML+ spec at:

        ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/htmlplus.ps

An older version can be found at:

        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/htmlplus.ps

Can I suggest that you try and print off a copy to take with you.
Unfortunately I won't be able to come myself, but hope that there will
be discussion of the spec and look forward to finding out how you all
get on.

I am hoping to get the HTML+ spec accepted as an Internet Draft as soon as
practical, and would very much like help with checking the spec for technical
feasibility and improving clarity etc.

Have fun,

Dave Raggett

p.s. There seems to be a Ctrl-D at the start of the file, an annoying
artifact generated by Microsoft Word! This shouldn't cause problems though.

I think that the original message was suggesting a third mouse _click_
(i.e. triple-click) and not the use of a third mouse button.

Actually, now that the search line is a separate box, this gives us a simple
solution: if the box is up (visible), and contains text, highlight any 
occurrance of this text in the page.

Also, maybe if the box is still up with text, the document search field could be 
pre-loaded from it.

Actually, in some future prerelease the URL display will be the "power
user" option and the normal display will be something along the lines
of "An image in GIF format at www.ncsa.uiuc.edu" with more information
as it is available.

The two most frequent interface requests we got with 1.x were "the
search keyword field takes up too much landscape and shouldn't always
be at the bottom of the window; put it in a dialog" and "show me where
the link is going to go before I go there", and we're still working on
how to accommodate everyone :-)...

Here's a thought, how about having the search keyword field add-itself to the
window only when the page is an index page?

How about an option to have the old-style search line automatically add itself
to the window when it encounters a searchable index, and not in any other case?

So I see a couple of minor interface tweaks kicked up a firestorm :-).

Here's what's probably going to happen:

- The "Search Index" button gets moved to the left side of the window,
  so it never falls off the end.  Note also that it's supposed to be
  blue in the 2.0 defaults, to differentiate it from the other
  buttons; put the following line or something similar in any existing
  app-defaults files:

  XMosaic*searchindex_button*Foreground:      #1d1d15155b5b

  There may be a "display text entry field in window when viewing an
  index; make it go away for normal documents" feature at some point
  but I don't like interfaces that mutate themselves so I'm gonna
  think on it and talk it over with our user interface expert.

- The new mouse-tracking URL display will show something like "Image,
  type GIF, from host foo.bar.com" by default, with a power user
  option for just the URL.  I'll probably put in a "don't display
  anything at all" resource too.

Cheers,
Marc

Subject: Documents and Manuals menus in Mosaic going away
X-Md4-Signature: 57fe150284807188e1d7ceb143881f17
Status: RO

I'm strongly considering stripping out the Documents and Manuals menus
of Mosaic for 2.0, and replacing them with hypermedia equivalents on
www.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80 and referenced from the Mosaic home page.  Why?

(a) As the information falls out of date or is expanded the interface
    wouldn't need to be updated, just the documents, and old Mosaic
    versions would continue to work.
(b) Those menus were largely put in there as part of Mosaic's proof of
    concept stage, so network pros and others who walk up to Mosaic
    for the first time not knowing what it can do will see interesting
    and useful things.  This is less useful now that it's established
    and has a broad and expanding user base, as many users are simply
    confused by many of the entries (what's X.500?  what does "News
    Interface" mean and why can't I get all those groups?)
(c) They are definitely confusing and misleading for people without
    pure Internet access.
(d) The various Manual servers may or may not be strictly legal, and
    it'd make me feel better if they were out of the interface proper.
(e) Many requests have come in for configuration functionality.  I'd
    rather discourage that, and rather encourage people to generate
    hypermedia documents instead -- better for them for some of the
    reasons being listed here, aids use of different browsers and
    avoids dependence on Mosaic, and more likely to help grow the Web.
(f) Some requests have come in to simplify the interface, particularly
    wrt those two menus, for people who want to present a simple
    information browsing environment to people for straightforward
    purposes (e.g., tour our library).
(g) Quite a few requests come in for additions to the "Other Home
    Pages" menu, and I feel guilty turning them down but don't want to
    bloat the menu beyond just a few; I'd rather leave new server
    tracking, etc. to the central index of Web servers at CERN +
    Mosaic What's New + demo document, so I'd like to get rid of that
    submenu altogether.

The Help menu, of course, will stay.

Feedback straight to me, please.

Cheers,
Marc

Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.36.1.1]

Several people have said they are having problems with printing out copies
of the HTML+ spec. I have now created a postscript version for 8.5" x 11"
paper:

        ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/htmlplus8.5x11.ps

The version in ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/htmlplus.ps was formatted for A4
paper and had one inch margins to avoid trouble, or so I thought ...  :(

I don't seem to be able to get rid of the Ctrl-D character at the beginning
of the postscript file. If this causes you problems, you may want to retrieve
the Microsoft Word for Windows orginal form of the document from:

        ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/htmlplus.doc           (use binary mode)

It uses the Adobe ATM fonts: Helvetica and Times. Change these to TrueType's
Arial and Times New Roman if there are any problems.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

n.b. Its going to be much much easier writing documents in HTML+ than
     with MS Word and having to fight styles, fonts and pagination etc. :-)

Subject: HTML and TEI?
Status: RO

Seriously impressed by our new Xmosaic server, I have at last started
to look at the differences between HTML and the emerging TEI dtd. I
downloaded the most recent HTML spec (the draft RFC titled "Hypertext
Markup Language", dated 13 July 1993) and read through it fairly
carefully.

This exercise has so far produced a mapping file which can be used with
the TF filter to turn a P2X file into a close approximation to an HTML
document, though I have yet to put this to the test. It also lead to my
producing the present note, which I am forwarding to both WWW and TEI
technical discussion lists in the hope of opening up a  useful
dialogue. Anyone on the TEI list who doesn't know what WWW is, and
anyone on the WWW list who doesn't know what TEI is, please ask me
directly rather than waste bandwidth rehearsing the familiar here.

What follows is mostly organized as a set of reactions to the RFC. In
each case, I've tried to think how I would express HTML semantics using
TEI syntax (rather than the other way round, which looks like a
non-starter). Various minor queries and niggles about HTML and the RFC
itself emerged in the process which I have also included. For clarity,
HTML tag names are given in uppercase (eg TITLE)  and TEI ones in
pointy brackets (eg <title>).

Apologies if I am rehearsing points already made several times over by
others!


Firstly, a minor irritant: the RFC is spattered with typos and spelling
errors. I can supply a list if needed, but a spell checker would do so
more quickly and painlessly.

More specific comments (keyed by section number) follow:

1.1.3 Several sections/features don't specify any status. Does this mean
they are mainstream or what? Does "treat the contents as though
the tags were not there" mean that processors suppress any tag they
don't know about but retain its content? It would be nice if they could
at least optionally preserve the tag for the benefit of other downstream
applications that can do something with them (tho I suppose that might
be counted as processing them). 

I think any reference to "undefined elements" here should be extirpated
root and branch. If you are using an SGML dtd (which HTML appears to
be) then there cannot be any undefined elements in your document,
unless you are willing to countenance illegal documents. In which case,
why are you using SGML at all? One should distinguish between elements
not defined in the dtd (always illegal) and elements which are defined
by the DTD but which an application does not know, or care to know,
about.

2.1 The paragraph on character sets seems to imply that the top half of
the ISO-646 IRV can be used ("There is no obligation...to contain any
characters above decimal 127"). As I read it, however, characters above
127 are at best undefined, at worst precluded, by the statement
 DESCSET  0 128 0 within the HTML SGML declaration.

3. The reference for ISO SGML is not present.

3.1.1 The second para under heading 'Attributes' reads "See other
tolerated forms (@@)". It would be nice to know what other forms are
tolerated. Presumably both e.g. <A HREF='FOO'>  and <A HREF=FOO> are?

3.1.2 Under the heading 'Character data' there is a rather confusing
discussion of the difficulties inherent in representing markup
characters within HTML content in such a way that they are not
interpreted as markup. There are at least two other ways of achieving 
this not suggested here: 

(a) use entity references, e.g. &lt and &gt for < and > respectively
(these do appear in the reference list at section 5, but they have been
expanded!)

(b) enclose the passage within a CDATA marked section (This last is the
most effective method we have found for dealing with the vexed problem of
getting SGML examples into our text in the TEI)

3.1.3 Obviously, given my previous comment, I am alarmed to read that
"Marked sections are deprecated". Why and by whom? And does "deprecated"
mean that they are illegal, unsupported, or what? And what is the
reference "See the SGML standard for complete information" supposed to
be doing here? (I mean, it's definitely a true statement, but I dont see
what it does to help in this context)

3.1.5 "In HTML, multiple spaces should be rendered as proportionally
larger spaces". I think this means that an HTML processor should treat
sequences of white space characters differently from a single such
character, which is sort of reasonable but rather far removed from the
spirit of SGML. More to the point though, it seems to contradict the
sentence "Neither spaces nor tabs should be used to make SGML source
layout more attractive or easier to read". I agree that tabs should be
eschewed entirely, but I don't see what's wrong with making the HTML
source human readable, so long as it's clearly understood that a
processor won't necessarily take any notice!

4.1 The elements defined as content of the HEAD element would, to my
way of thinking, more naturally be defined as attributes, since they
are "properties of the whole document", not content; an exception to
this is the LINK elements. It would be helpful to have a clear
statement of  the circumstances in which one would encode an
association between documents using a LINK rather than with an ANCHOR.
Is it in fact arbitrary, or must a LINK also be included for *all*
ANCHORs in a document that target some other document?

TEI equivalence: There is nothing directly equivalent to the HEAD and
its content in the TEI scheme. The 'n' attribute on the <text> or
<TEI.2> element would be the most natural place to put the information
contained by the TITLE element. It would probably be better to define a
special element within the <encodingDesc> of the <TEIHeader> to hold the
other contents of the HEAD.

4.7 Anchors

There is a lot to be said about the different linking philosophies of
HTML and TEI, and I will only scratch the surface here (particularly
because details of the TEI proposals are still being finalized). As I
understand it, the target of an HTML LINK or ANCHOR is either the whole
of a document (identified by URL) or to a point within it,
distinguished by being preceded by a sharp sign, or a combination of
the two. In TEI the natural way of doing the former would be to use an
<xref> and of doing the latter to use a <ref>. The former uses
TEI-defined syntax for extended pointers, while the latter relies on
the built in id/idref mechanism of SGML. 

For example, the HTML link <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</A> might
be represented in a TEI document as <xref doc=CERNdoc>CERN</xref>. This
has the added requirement that there be an system entity definition
somewhere else in the prologue associating the entity CERNdoc with the
system identifier which is given explicitly within the HTML document. 
[I think Elliot Kimber made a similar point in relation to making HTML
HyTime-conformant in May this year]

An HTML link such as <A HREF="#foo"> (which is presumably legal only if
there is somewhere else in the same document another anchor <A
NAME='#foo'>) translates simply into <ref target=foo> (again, assuming
that somewhere else there is an element bearing the attribute
specification 'id=foo'). 

Finally, an HTML link such as <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/#foo"> maps
fairly neatly onto <xref doc=CERNdoc from='id (foo)'>, with the same
additional requirement that the entity CERNdoc be declared.

There are no direct equivalents for the REL REV or METHODS attributes,
though there is a 'type' attribute which could carry similar information.
The TITLE attribute could here, as elsewhere, be mapped to the TEI
global 'n'  attribute. I don't understand how the proposed URN attribute
will work, so cannot comment on it.

When the A element is used to encode the target of a pointer (i.e. where
the NAME attribute is used rather than the HREF attribute), the natural
TEI solution might appear to be to use the <anchor> element,
representing 
  A <A NAME=serious> serious</A> crime ...
as
  A <anchor id=serious> serious crime ...
However, as shown above, <anchor> is an empty element, whereas A has content.
I don't know how serious a problem this is, partly because I don't see
what the purpose of delimiting the scope of the A element is in this
case. If it is important, then some other element needs to be chosen,
probably the general purpose <seg> element -- in the TEI scheme, all
elements may take the 'id' attribute, and can therefore serve as the
target of a link.

The TEI scheme also provides a parallel pair of elements <ptr> and
<xptr> for links which do not have content. These are probably not
relevant, except when converting from TEI to HTML, which will always be
fraught with difficulty because of the number of possible ways of
encoding links in the former which are unsupported by the latter. 

An alternative would be to regard the HTML coding for targets simply as
an alien notation, and use only <xref>, specifying the correct HTML
syntax  with the 'foreign' keyword on the 'from' attribute. I think
this simply sweeps the difficulties under the carpet, but it may turn out
to be the only generally viable solution in the long run.


4.8  The TEI <address> currently has element content only and cannot
therefore be used as a direct equivalent for the ADDRESS element. This
may be worth reviewing; I don't see any reason why it (the TEI one)
should not have mixed content.

4.10 It's not clear from the discussion whether the BLOCKQUOTE element
is also intended for use with inline quotes, nor exactly what "rendered
specially" means here. The TEI has a <quote> element which is probably
the best match.

4.11 As defined, HTML will allow for entirely arbitrary sequence of
heading levels, so that a sequence like 'H1 H2 H4 H2 H5' would be
perfectly OK. The TEI (like most other SGML schemes) would find that
decidedly odd. The 'level' semantics in the TEI scheme are attached to a
DIV element rather than to a heading (so that untitled document
subdivisions are possible, which HTML does not allow). 

This means that translating from TEI to HTML is relatively painless:
<div1><head> becomes <H1>, <div2><head> becomes <H2> and so on.
The reverse translation would be problematic if the HTML document
had an erratic sequence like the one noted above.
The TEI scheme also allows for an arbitrary depth of nesting levels, if
"vanilla" or un-numbered divs are used: however, as noted in the RFC,
deeply nested structures are improbable.

4.12 IMG. Why is the attribute which specifies the URL of an IMG called
'SRC' (rather than HREF?) It might be handy to have an extra attribute
to hold a brief description of the image for the benefit of processors
which cannot display the graphic: or would this be better treated as an
Anchor? The notion of "inline" might helpfully be defined here. Is the
implication simply that an IMG will not cause a line break on the
screen, whereas an A that points to a graphic image always will?

The TEI has an element <figure>, but I'm not sure whether this is what is
wanted here. More probably the generic <xref> or <xptr> would be an
appropriate equivalent, possibly with a REND attribute.

4.13 I don't understand the sentence beginning "The node may be
queried...". I also don't understand what "Status: standard" at the end
of this section means (it's not in the list at 1.1.3 unless it's
synonymous with 'mainstream')

4.14 See remarks under 4.1 and 4.7. Clarification as to whether LINKs are
permitted within BODY would be useful.

4.15.1 The content model for DL is a bit weird, and does not reflect the
constraints required by the discussion here. For example, the content
model would allow <DL> <DT>term1<DT>term2<DT>term3 </DL> which is
clearly wrong. It should be changed as the note in the DTD suggests. I
will refrain from pointing out that the underlying problem here is the
use of empty elements to indicate things that really have content (such
as terms, definitions, paragraphs etc.) rather than any inherent
"messiness" in mixed content models, as I expect you're sick of being
told as much.

What is it about glossary lists? The TEI also currently proposes a
somewhat eccentric model in which DT would be mapped to <label> and DD
to <item> (note however that this has already attracted some adverse
criticism, and may change). 

One thing which probably won't change is that all lists are mapped to
the same element <list>, with the distinctions specified in HTML by
different tags being specified as values of a 'type' attribute. So, for

<UL><LI>list element <LI>another one</UL>
<OL><LI>list element <LI>another one</OL>

a natural TEI translation would be

<list><item>list element <item>another one</list>
<list type=ordered><item>list element <item>another one</list>

The values for the 'type' attribute are not currently defined. It would
be reasonable to use 'ol', 'ul', 'menu', 'dir' if that seemed
appropriate. 

The COMPACT attribute on DL would most naturally be translated into
another of the TEI global attributes 'rend', which can be applied to
any element to supply additional information about its rendering. Why
is COMPACT not permitted in HTML for anything except glossary lists?

4.17.2 Additional white space has crept into the first example within
the <P> tags.

4.18 The PRE element has no obvious equivalent in the TEI scheme as
published, though we have (of course) found it necessary to invent
something like it in the dtd for documenting tagsets. This is the
element <eg>, which has a content model of CDATA, but generally
realizes this by a CDATA marked section. Probably because I have been
doing things this way for so long,  I find a bit strange the way that
some, but not all, elements within a PRE element are interpreted. I
think I would be happier with an element which was  entirely
preformatted, behaving rather like the LaTeX verbatim environment.

The sentence describing the use of the tab character needs to be a bit
tighter, I think. I suggest it should read " ... must be interpreted
either as the smallest positive.... multiple of 8, or as equivalent to
a single space." (and delete the last sentence)

As with COMPACT, the TEI equivalent for the WIDTH attribute would
probably be 'rend=width:80' or something like it.

4.20.1 It would be nice to know whether these physical styles are
additive, i.e. whether <I>this is <B>really</B> important</I> 
results in bold italic for the word 'really'. If so, there must
be some combinations which are illegal or undefined: for example
<I><TT>implausible</TT></I>, or <B><B>very bold <B>indeed</B></B></B>

The TEI approach would be to mark all passages which are distinct
typographically (but not in any other respect) with the <hi> element,
optionally using its 'rend' attribute to specify the flavour of
hilighting involved: thus  <hi rend=I>this is <hi rend=B>really</hi>
important</hi>. And, before you ask, I don't think the TEI has
expressed an opinion as to whether the semantics of the rend attribute
are additive either. 

4.20.2 I need more information about what exactly most of these mean
before being able to specify TEI equivalents for them. In an ideal
world I'd recommend that they all be junked and replaced by whatever
subset of the existing TEI phrase level elements seem to be most
useful. For starters, the list should include foreign words, technical
terms, names of persons places and organizations, dates, times,
expressions of quantity... What is a citation? (examples would help)

That's probably enough for now.

I think I have to disagree with you there, Dave. Try telling that to
the MS Word fans here. MS Word (and Interleaf, PageMaker, WordPerfect)
are a helluva sight easier to write in than a text editor, even with
Marc A's excellent GNU mode to help.

What I (and I think you) really want are output filters for the like of
MS Word (and/or RTF) that produces HTML(+) to make PUBLISHING it
easier. I had a desperate try a few months ago, and the results were
fairly horrible (I tried to use DEC's RTF and SGML CDA converters).
While we're on the subject (again) I repeat my cry; has anyone written
such a filter yet? I'd have a go if I had the time and even the
faintest understanding of RTF.

I think you are on the right track (and a necessary one).   I had wondered 
why all those documents were coded into the menus ... it seemed like a simple 
problem eagerly waiting to become an administrative nightmare!

I would like to request/clarify two things:

(1)   >> The Help menu, of course, will stay.

      Do I interpret this correctly when I assume that this will provide
      a clear and intuitive entry to COMPLETE "How to Use Mosaic" docs?
      (I.e., the entry "NCSA Mosaic Manual" on the Manuals menu will 
      migrate to the Help menu.)

(2)   Will there be a menu entry accessing the centralized documents which
      will in turn give inexperienced users some intuitive way to get out 
      to the Web?  E.g., will be a built-in pointer to the central index
      described below?
      
      >> I'd rather leave new server tracking, etc. to the central index 
      >> of Web servers at CERN + Mosaic What's New + demo document
      
      Of course, a maintained link in the Mosaic Home Page or in the
      Tutorial would also work.

      (Brand new users are always going to need some sort of help getting
      around at first.  And Mosaic will spread faster if their first
      experiences are satisfying rather than frustrating.  But you know that.)


Thoughts off the top of my head...

Subject: W4W WYSIWYG HTML authoring tool
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 2.0a7>
Status: RO


THIS IS NOT AN PRODUCT RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT (YET)


I have long pondered the availability of HTML authoring
tools to speed the proliferation of WWW served data. My
organization is largely a PC/Windows based one (unfortunatly),
therefor a tool for that environment is desireable. I read
Chuck Suttons's previous message about W4W/RTF conversion
to HTLM with great interest. A read of his code, and test 
drive of his products, caused me to rethink the approach.  As a
result I've had one of my students take Chuck's initial idea
and try to take it furthur, but without any C-code external
to W4W.  We have had a surprising degree of success in
achieving our goals with W4W style sheets and macros alone.
In essence, we have defined a W4W style to mechanize 
structuring HTML documents and then a macro to create an
export filter which produces the HTML. We accomodate 
embedded (invisible) URLs and "hot words" to give the
appearance of making W4W into a WYSIWYG HTML Authoring tool.
Much work and experimentation is still needed, but I wanted
to let you'se guys know we were pushing this front, And to
solicit input of ideas, effort, or other useful things.  One
of the thinks we'de like to do in the future is to have but
a single tool be our authoring and viewing tool, and also our
general word processing program.  It would also be nice if this
tool could read in the HTML+ DTD to remain current without
reprogramming the macros for each change. This may be a tall 
order given my uncertainty of tbd changes in HTML+ and given
how long we've been using W4W around here.

I was assuming that you would be using a WYSIWYG editor for HTML+. It will
*definitely* be a lot easier to use than Word, particularly for figures and
margin notes! This is partly due to the lower level models used in most
DTP packages, and partly to infuriating features e.g. the problems in deleting
unwanted styles in Word after merging two documents.

I can't comment on the other packages as I haven't used them!

Dave.

I regret that I'm unable to attend the W^5, though I had hoped to.  I
have a reasonably stable set of rough recommendations for addressing
the security needs of HTTP in the short-to-medium term; I've tried to
write it in an accessible way.  I'm interested in any comments or
whatever, and would like to remain involved with what people want to
do for integration.

ADDING SECURITY TO THE HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
--------------------------------------------------

This document is intended to be a review of some available security
mechanisms and their usefulness in adding security to the HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a protocol associated strongly with the
World Wide Web (WWW).

I assume security will be useful in the short run for interactive uses
of HTTP (e.g. the PUT and CHECKIN/OUT commands) as well as possible
access control.  In the longer run, a security service would be
necessary if publishers are going to make copyrighted material
available via HTTP on some basis for charge.  In considering
solutions, I believe an answer to the first set of problems is most
urgent, though something which will also address commercial concerns
is preferable.

First, I'll address what I believe the security needs for HTTP will
be, both for the short term and for the long term.

- LOCAL USER AUTHENTICATION seems likely to be needed, and soon.  As
  authoring tools become available and become integrated with browsing
  tools, it will be desirable to allow people to create and edit their
  hypertext documents through the standard HTTP protocol.  By "local"
  I mean "mostly used for people within the same administrative
  domain"; it seems likely that this will be a big need early on.
  User authentication and message integrity checking should suffice
  for this application; disclosure protection may be desirable in some
  cases.  This authentication could also serve as a mechanism for
  access control if restricted information is to be put in the Web.

- REMOTE USER AUTHENTICATION for similar purposes, such as group
  editing, collaborative hypertext, and annotations is also a
  significant need.  It will probably be needed somewhat later than
  local authentication.  User authentication and message integrity
  checking are also probably enough, though disclosure protection is
  also sometimes desirable.

- COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION AUTHENTICATION will likely be slower to catch
  on than the above; the political barriers to its widespread use are
  nontrivial.  Commercial transactions require the greatest security,
  obviously, and authentication should be bolstered with
  non-repudiation of origin.  Disclosure protection becomes more
  important, and the access control of the server is critical.

Four different approaches were considered seriously (not including toy
solutions, like cleartext password authentication.)  First, I'll
mention the two that I am not reviewing in detail:

  PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY (PGP) is an implementation for public-key email
  encryption.  PGP is in the process of becoming more "respectable;"
  however, there is currently no abstract specification for message
  format, encapsulating MIME objects, and the like.  There is not yet
  a PGP FAQ.

  COMMON AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY (CAT) has an IETF working group
  building a general framework for this kind of security service.  It
  looks good, but it also doesn't look ripe for coding yet; it's
  likely that this will be the solution HTTP should migrate to in the
  long term.  It's described in a variety of Internet Drafts starting
  with "draft-ietf-cat".

The two systems which I will review in detail:

  KERBEROS is a network authentication system based on a tickets
  obtained from an authentication server.  More information, including
  pointers to specs and the like, is available in the
  comp.protocols.kerberos FAQ.

  PRIVACY ENHANCED MAIL (PEM) is a specification for security services
  for electronic mail and, more generally, MIME objects.  Its
  specification is in RFC 1421-1424.


Kerberos (KRB):
- Kerberos, version 4 (KRB-4) is a widely used security protocol; it
  is typically used for mutual client-server authentication in a local
  or campus network.  KRB-4 is based on DES, and authentications
  are performed by a trusted authentication server.

- Kerberos, version 5 (KRB-5) is in beta, and its specifications are
  still an Internet draft.  KRB-5 enhances 4 in a number of ways, and
  is not backward compatible.

Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM):
- Privacy Enhanced Mail with symmetric keys (PEM-S) allows secure
  electronic mail but provides no key management support.

- Privacy Enhanced Mail with asymmetric keys (PEM-A) allows secure
  electronic mail via public key, and defines a key certification
  structure.  PEM-A and PEM-S are compatible in that they share a
  specification, and a full implementation of PEM supports both.

All of these mechanism are essentially the same with regard to content
protection (a session key is somehow agreed on) so I won't dwell on
that issue too much (but that doesn't mean it isn't important.)


GENERAL APPROACHES
------------------

KRB is based on a shared secret symmetric key between the user and a
central server.  The user may then obtain "tickets" for using specific
services, such as an HTTP server, which the server may validate using
its own secret key which is shared with the central server.

Services sharing the same central server are said to be in the same
"realm"; authentication across different realms not really viable in
KRB-4; KRB-5 does somewhat better, allowing the possibility of a realm
hierarchy.

Kerberos was designed with the intention of allowing mutual
authentication between two entities (normally the user and the server)
on an assumed insecure network; it is reasonably robust with regard to
things like replay attacks.  Only the main servers must be secure.


PEM is an extension to Internet mail to allow symmetric and asymmetric
encryption of contents.  PEM-S is based on a secret shared key between
the two users (in this case, the user and the server); a different
shared key would be needed for each user/server combination, which
would not scale well.  The real point of PEM, though, is its use with
public-key.

PEM-A readily allows peer-to-peer authentication (via certificates)
without the need for central servers (which could become bottlenecks.)
Certificates issued by hierarchically structured certifying
authorities verify key validity, easing key management.  It is worth
noting that asymmetric cryptography tends to be much more
CPU-demanding than symmetric.  The HTTP servers will be doing a lot of
this, and it could bog them down; typically, servers will be verifying
signatures.  Fortunately, the RSA algorithm (unlike the DSA) allows
verifying signatures to be reasonably cheap, helping reduce server
load concerns.


LOCAL AUTHENTICATION
--------------------

Many sites already run KRB-4.  For them, it seems plausible that
simply adding HTTP to their existing secure setup would be the easiest
short-term solution.

For sites not already running KRB-4, it cannot easily be added and
would not be likely to be worth bothering with for security on just
one service.  KRB-5 faces a similar situation.

PEM-S might be a more suitable solution for small sites who want
something quick and simple with less setup than Kerberos.  However,
each user must establish a shared key with the server; this is viable
only if the number of users is reasonably small.

PEM-A is arguably overkill for just local authentication, though it
would work fine.


REMOTE AUTHENTICATION
---------------------

KRB-4 is unsuitable, since cross-realm authentication of n different
administrative domains requires n^2 secret keys.

KRB-5 allows hierarchical structuring of realms, which introduces the
possibility of effective cross-realm authentication for such services.
However, central servers near the top of the hierarchy could become
central points of failure, bottlenecked, or compromised (jeopardizing
the security of the whole net.)

PEM-S is unsuitable, since each user-server pair would require a
separate key.

PEM-A allows peer-to-peer authentication without regard to
administrative domains, and does not require real-time contact with
any central server.  This makes it suitable to this application
without the same bottleneck or central-failure problems.  Compromise
of certifying authorities is possible, though the PCA structure should
allow clear delineation of how secure these things are.  PEM's
relationship with mail also makes it particularly suitable for
non-interactive HTTP through an email gateway, which I believe is also
an important consideration.

COMMERCIAL AUTHENTICATION
-------------------------

Non-repudiation of origin is critical for commercial transactions,
particularly given the desirability of a proliferation of small
publishers.  If the publisher says "Joe Smith requested document x at
a price of $1,000" and Joe says "No I didn't" there needs to be a way
to prove who is lying.

Non-repudiation of origin is only possible with asymmetric
cryptography, and thus PEM-A is the only system of those reviewed
which seems viable for this purpose.

Commercial use of PEM-A within the U.S. will require licensing the
right to use the asymmetric crypto algorithms.  While this will be an
impediment in the U.S. for the short term, it does not change the fact
that public-key is needed to do secure electronic business.


RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

An appropriate interoperation standard for Kerberos (certainly KRB-4,
probably also KRB-5) and HTTP should be created.  However, by itself,
Kerberos does not seem sufficient to meet the security needs of HTTP
over a large and growing network.  Adding Kerberos to a site not
already so equipped is nontrivial; Kerberos needs central servers and
probably could not scale to a system with 100,000 different
administrative realms and 10,000,000 users.

Allowing interoperation of PEM and HTTP should not be inordinately
difficult, since HTTP/1.0 is essentially MIME and the PEM-MIME
interaction is already defined (though still in an Internet draft.)  I
have proposed a mechanism for this involving creating MIME types
message/http-request and message/http-response; I'm sure it will need
some refinement but I believe some approach like this can be viable.
Some additional features may need to be defined; for example, PEM has
no explicit mechanism for handling replay attacks, so a timestamp
within the http-request would be desirable.

This extension is just a part of the work that needs to be done in
bringing WWW and MIME closer together; some other things might
include:

- Allowing mail gateways to WWW services to work automatically
  (this is a domain where PEM is an obvious big win and KRB is
  probably completely impractical)
- Allowing a multipart MIME message with HTML parts that reference
  other parts within the message
- Allowing URLs as an access spec for message/external-body (or
  making the two different specifications for fetching information
  closer in some way)

Kerberos is a good system, and more sites should use it.  Sites using
it should be able to use it for HTTP authentication for their users.
However, that paradigm does not seem to effectively scale to the needs
of HTTP in a very large network with the need for authentication
across a large number of users and administrative entities.  Of the
systems sufficiently defined to talk about in concrete terms today,
PEM-A seems the only one with the potential to meet those needs.
PEM-S is not terribly useful except as a stopgap solution for non-KRB
sites wishing simple security and not yet wishing to move to PEM-A.
Although PEM-S is sort of awkward (though not really harder to manage
than cleartext passwords, and much more secure) it leaves the door
wide open to PEM-A.

SOME OTHER CONCERNS
-------------------

Cryptography, particularly public-key, is an issue with some amount of
disagreement and political bickering.  To answer a few commonly held
misconceptions:

- Public-key is patented in the U.S. buy Public Key Partners; they
  hold several patents which they claim collectively cover all known
  methods of doing public-key.  A reference implementation of the
  algorithms needed for doing PEM called RSAREF is available free for
  noncommercial use only.  Since other WWW software, such as Xmosaic,
  already has noncommercial restrictions this doesn't seem like an
  insurmountable problem.  The rule more or less boils down to "if you
  make money, PKP will get a share" until the patents expire (the
  patent on RSA expires in late 2000) or are struck down in court
  (some think this could happen, but I'm not holding my breath.)

- The U.S. (and some other nations) classifies strong cryptographic
  software as munitions and thus there are legal problems with regard
  to export.  The worse-case scenario regarding this is likely similar
  to the current situation with regard to Kerberos; a dumbed-down
  no-crypt version of Kerberos is exported, and the crypto software is
  engineered and attached abroad.

- Contrary to some claims, there are no license restrictions on PEM to
  email only.  In particular, the implementation (TIS/PEM) for which
  this was a concern may be used for HTTP as long as it's
  noncommercial in nature.  (I have this on authority from Stephen
  Crocker <crocker@tis.com> who wrote the license in question.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should note that my "pubkey" scheme is in fact as close to PEM
as I could make it without changing the current protocol, and bearing
in mind that not everyone wants to carry around a public key
(which is not necessary in case of http, because the server never
actively contacts the client, it's always the other way around -- so
we don't need to have a completely symmetrical system).

Sorry, what do you mean by termination stuff??

> If the server *does* support this form of authentication, it returns a

No! The no-sessions and no-state requirements have been there from the
start and are well justified.  If a stand-alone server holds the
connection it *will* slow things down considerably by reserving the
server from taking the next request.

Subject: Handling of unknown attributes of a tag by a browser
To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]
Status: RO

A question concerning the handling of unknown attributes of a tag
within HTML or HTML+ proposal.  

I am currently defining the representation of building standards in
computerized form for my masters thesis.  I intend to use HTML+ as the basic
markup tool for this representation.  However it does require the
ability to assoicate an attribute or attributes to figures, headers
and paragraphs which will be used by both 'extended' browsers and the
server.

However I would like the information to be available to other browsers
which would support HTML+ but not the specific extensions.  Through
the RFCs that are available for HTML and HTML+ I cannot locate a
definite answer on how a browser is to handle an undefined attribute.
Is it intended to:
          1)        just ignore the illegal attribute and process the
                    tag otherwise,
          2)        or, ignore the tag and associated text to the end
                    tag,
          3)        or some variation on the above.

For example, in HTML+, the following tag <p classifier="XXX"> I would
think should still generate a paragraph break even if the attribute
'classifier' is not understood by the browser.  The same would be for
<h2 classifier="YYY">

Subject: LaTeX to HTML Translator V0.1
Status: RO


Version 0.1 of the LaTeX to HTML translator is now available.
For more information see: 

http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html

The translator:

 o breaks up a document into sectioning components, 
 
 o provides a next, previous, and up navigation panel on every page,  
 
 o handles equations, tables, figures, and any arbitrary environment
   by passing them to LaTeX and including them as HTML inlined images, 
 
 o handles definitions of new commands, environments, and theorems, 
 
 o handles footnotes, tables of contents, lists of figures and tables, 
   bibliographies and can generate an  index, 
 
 o translates cross-references into hyperlinks, 
 
 o provides hooks for including arbitrary links (internal to the 
   document or external) as commands, 
 
 o can deal sensibly at least with the Common LaTeX commands 
   summarized at the back of the  LaTeX blue book [1], 
 
 o will try and translate any document with embedded LaTeX 
   commands irrespective of whether it is complete or syntactically legal.  

The translator is written in Perl. It is possible to get acceptable
output if you just have Perl but to use all the above features you will 
need latex, dvips, gs (ghostscript) and some utilities from the 
pbmplus library (pnmcrop and ppmtogif). Also, because of the heavy 
use of inlined images in the final HTML output, it would
be better to have a viewer which supports the <IMG> tag
(e.g. NCSA Mosaic).

Just wanted to take a minute to point out a few bugs in the servers
put out by NCSA & CERN.  It doesn't really affect most browsers (yet),
but it might bite people who start using HTTP/1.0 aware browsers
(lynx, and my Emacs browser are the only two I am aware of at the
moment)

Problem is - when sending multiple lines of an HTTP/1.0 request to a
HTTP/.9 server, the output gets truncated if the lines are sent too
fast.

For example, type this in an emacs buffer:

(let ((proc (open-network-stream "WWW" "WWW" "www.ncsa.uiuc.edu" 80)))
  (process-send-string proc "GET /EVL/docs/Welcome.html HTRQ")
  (process-send-string proc "From: someuser@somesite"))

Then evaluate it - you will get a buffer called WWW that has only
about 1/2 of the text of the EVL Welcome page.

You can get the same effects outside of emacs by cutting and pasting
in an Xterm.  

> telnet info.cern.ch 80
GET / HTRQ  	    	    	    \_ Cut & paste in xterm
From: someuser@somesite	    	    /  typing it by hand is too slow

and you will get a truncated version of the CERN home page.

I was able to get this to appear in lynx (which uses the new library
from cern for HTTP/1.0) to do this - it took a _long_ time though.  I
guess the cern library spaces out its request lines when sending to
the server.

Does anyone know what could be causing this?  I've gotten around it
for now in my emacs browser, but it was a pain tracking it down - I
thought it was a bug in emacs, and I asked rms for help and then he
discovered it wasn't emacs fault.  (Hallelujah, praise the one true
editor :)

As I said, I've gotten around it for now, and hopefully HTTP/0.9 only
servers won't be around much longer, but it would be nice if this was
fixed, or at least documented so you could call it a feature. :)

Thanks,
    Bill Perry

Hi WWWers,
I want to tell NCSA Mosaic (or whatever browser) what it has to write
in the field "Document URL" (this would be a <HEADER>-Information).
Is there any tag to do this?
(the problem is, that I don't like the server-output from keyword-search
and such; e.g. instead of 
Document URL: http://httpserver.forwiss.uni-passau.de:2008/passau.map?245,189
I'd rather like to have 
Document URL: http://httpserver.forwiss.uni-passau.de/passau/stadt/plan/dom.html 
 - the last one, I would like to tell the parser explicitly)
Thanx,
Andi

I believe that unknown attributes should be ignored, in the same way
that elements with unknown tags are currently ignored, i.e. option (1).

Thanks for raising this point, I will make sure it gets into the next
revision to the HTML+ spec.

Many thanks,

Please don't flame me for suggesting yet ANOTHER tag, and sorry if this
has been thought of, but I couldn't see it in the draft RFC, Dave.

Many, if not most, documents contain date and time information. There
are many conventions for representing it.

It would be VERY nice to have standard markup for date and time so that
(a) it can be rendered in the READER's local convention (e.g.
month/day/year in the US and day/month/year in the rest of the world
(b) it can be rendered in the reader's local timezone (or GMT)
(c) The user can input dates/times in a form input field (as mentioned
in the draft RFC) in the correct local convention/timezone, and the
target recieves them in GMT.
(d) numeric dates can be easily extracted from / inserted into
documents (e.g a directory browsing http server can show update times
for files without having to render them itself
(e) A common date format can be used to tell when a document has been
updated in HTTP, when automatic updating etc becomes widespread. Not
essential, maybe, but convenient, as above.

This is another thing for the <HEAD>...</HEAD> section, and it should
be in the format of RFC 822 headers, as there is code out there to
deal with them.

more and more documents begin to contain lements that are only

when printing these documents to paper it would be nice if they could
be suppressed.
so I propose yet another tag or parameter to a tag to indicate that
the next part is not to be used when printing the document to paper.

How do those those documents with GIF icons in their docs that are
itty-bitty versions of full-sized pictures create those small versions?
Is there a general bitmap manipulator to do this, or did you brew your?

For the vatican exhibit and for the soviet exhibit I used xv

There is a catch though... the best results are when you use less than
say 150 colors per page and less than 50 colors per image
(this is true for xmosaic, I don't know about other programs)

I use the pbmplus programs for quantifying the colors.

Thank you Peter, for raising the issue of representation for Date/time.

So far the HTML+ spec only mentions date/time in regard to the INPUT tag.
You can restrict the input field with the TYPE attribute:

    The following types of field are supported:

    ...
    date    restricted to a recognised date format
    ...

The spec for HTTP/1.0 mentions a "Date:" field in the RFC822 format for
the date the document was last modified. This is useful for checking if
a document has been updated, e.g. for automatic updating of indexes.

This leaves open:

    a)  identifying the date/time of last update for documents
        retrieved by protocols other than HTTP

    b)  specifying the "recognised date formats" for input fields

    c)  canonical representation for date/time information within documents

(a) could be addressed by supporting an update element in the header section.

One solution for (b) would be to restrict support to the RFC 822 format.
Another idea is to prohibit giving the month as a number. This can be avoided
if authors state the desired format in the document as part of the normal
text.

(c) could be handled by making "date" a recognised role for logical emphasis.
Browsers would then have the option of displaying the date as given in the
document or reformatting it according to local preferences. Alternatively,
a new "date" tag could be introduced for the same purpose.

My proposal for HTML+
---------------------

    o   To ignore (a) and recommend that HTTP servers all return
        the "Date:" header for the date/time last updated. One can
        also get at the date/time for FTP access in most cases.

    o   To ignore (b) and recommend that authors disambiguate the
        desired format as part of the document's normal text.

    o   To add "date" to the list of recommended roles for logical
        emphasis and suggest that it is used for RFC 822 dates only.

What do other people suggest?

I quite agreee (see below) - this is a problem area - for examples of documents which include substantial included graphics images, see
the output of the Latex to HTML converter program by Nikos Drakos - not
only does it successfully show the more complex Latex formatting, for
 example for mathematics, but it also has
a set of iconic images, which are included for navigation, and to mark
footnotes and references.

For more information see: 

   http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html

or contact Nikos at  nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk

Documents with these features require considerable extra support, although in 
particular case there would be no need to print from  the HTML, as the
orignal text versions could be made available.

To generalise, what Frans is requesting is conditional text.

The logical way way of accomplishing this in SGML is to use the marked 
section feature.  Marked sections are used to show which parts of 
documents should not be processed, or only processed under certain 
conditions.

Could I suggest the following form for within documents ?

<date normalised="1993-05-01T15:30:00">May 1, 1993</date>

i.e. the user can put the date/time to be displayed in any desired form, 
but a normalised form is added as an optional attribute.  (The normalised 
date here is not in RFC 822 form but the idea's the same).

One problem with this, however, is that it needs its own tag and cannot 
be a logical role of the <em> tag.  (This problem may arise for other 
elements which are currently coded as role attributes.)

Yet another way of dealing with the little arrows problem is to use
entity references. If your document says &left.arrrow you can decide at
runtime what you want that to expand to by enabling an appropriate
entity declaration. (which is effectively what you'd have to do to switch
on or off a marked section anyway)

Marked sections are not satisfactory for all conditional text, as they
are not delimited in the output of an sgml parser (ESIS).  The text is
just *there*.  You might want to highlight conditional text, and to do
that you'd need another mechanism.

If we must have something inside the document (which I don't think we should)
then it should be in the same format as the Date: and Last-Modified: headers
in HTTP/1.0 (these fields are defined per RFC850 but must be GMT).

  If we must have something inside the document (which I don't think we should)
  then it should be in the same format as the Date: and Last-Modified: headers
  in HTTP/1.0 (these fields are defined per RFC850 but must be GMT).

I get the impression this suggestion is not for "the date of the document"
(which I agree should not be inside the document) but for "how to include
dates in documents in such a way that they're mechanically recognizable as
dates" (which I think would be a useful type of semantic markup).

I agree that date representation should be kept consistent (for the
"normalised" version, although we'd be better off coming up with a name for
that attribute that's spelled the same in English and American), and also like
the idea of allowing a suggested textual presentation.

I can't make up my mind whether or not usage like

   I was thinking <date normalised="Sun, 01 Aug 1993 20:21:22 +0100">last
   night</date> that it might be a good idea to be able to do this.

would be cool or should be discouraged.  I have no coherent comments on this,
just wanted to bring it up.

Yes, but I also think Frans is talking about structural information that
needs to be reflected in the viewing client, not expressed within
document, i.e. moving to the table of contents, etc...

Although I can envision a completely hyperscript/link document that
would be both the document and the viewer, there still seems to be
standardization on the presentation of the structural information by the
viewer (and the printer, for that matter).

more and more documents begin to contain lements that are only

when printing these documents to paper it would be nice if they could

so I propose yet another tag or parameter to a tag to indicate that
the next part is not to be used when printing the document to paper.

I'd agree; some mechanism for this kind of markup would have some
distinct advantages.  As a random example, with a spiffy browser and
appropriate hooks I should have been able to read an announcement
about the W^5, click a mouse button on the date, and had my electronic
appointment book pop up opened to that range of dates.

A couple things to think about...

- Dates frequently represent bounded intervals rather than a single
  point in time.  Should there be a way to represent "from 3:00 until
  8:00 PDT on 30 Nov 95" in these?
- Dates vary in terms of their quantity of significant "terms"; e.g.
  "November, 1993" should be representable and it's certainly not the
  same as "1 Nov 1993 00:00:00 GMT".

   - Dates frequently represent bounded intervals rather than a single

     "November, 1993" should be representable and it's certainly not the
     same as "1 Nov 1993 00:00:00 GMT".

So, suppose we allow for leaving out sections:

   <date at="1993">1993</date>
   <date at="Nov 1993">this month</date>
   <date at="1 Nov 1993">the first of November, 1993</date>
   <date at="1 Nov 1993 00:00:00">midnight</date>

Length of field is enough to distinguish between these.

I think we could consider this a special case of your first point:

   <date at="1 May 1993">Mayday</date>

is in some sense the same as

   <date at="1 May 1993 00:00:00" until="2 May 1993 00:00:00">Mayday</date>

On the other hand, this looks both ugly and ambiguous to me at first glance.

I like the "at" and "until" attributes as an answer to the question of
intervals--short names are nice.  Would these cause problems?

P.S. While we're on the subject of things it would be nice to be able to
indicate, "the third Monday of each month" or "at 3:00 daily" are a kind of
date that comes up fairly often--repeating events.  I don't know how
complicated we want to make this, though.

Something kind of like that probably could work, though arguably
including so much varying info within just one variable is contrary to
the SGML philosophy, but the following sort of format doesn't make me
feel warm and fuzzy either:

   <DATE YEAR=1993 MONTH=11 DATE=1 HOUR=00 MINUTE=00 SECOND=00
   TZ=GMT>midnight</DATE>

The key distinction to me is one of time zones; presumably at least
some browsers will translate times (I assume the above times are GMT)
into local time, in which case it would (for me, being 5 hours behind
GMT) come out to

	30 April 1993 19:00 until 1 May 1993 19:00

which doesn't seem like what is meant by "The 1st of May."  Obviously
any time that isn't at least as specific as hours shouldn't be
translated by time zone.

Here's how we did it in the Docbook DTD:

<!ELEMENT OrderedList   - -  (ListItem+)>
        <!ATTLIST  OrderedList
                %commonatts;
                Numeration      (Arabic | Upperalpha | Loweralpha
                                | Upperroman | Lowerroman) Arabic
                InheritNum  (Inherit | Ignore)  Ignore
                Continuation  (Yes | No)  No >

Numeration is what Nathan is looking for; InheritNum indicates that 
the previous level of numbering should continue for a nested list
(that is, 1.A for the first item of a list nested at second level,
instead of just A); Continuation means to pick up the sequence of
the last closed ordered list (one list has four items, then you
break for some paras, then start another list at number 5 instead
of number 1).

But it isn't.  It's an essential part of reference.  Readers using
different browsers MUST get the same numbering, or they can't talk to
each other usefully about numbered items.  Same goes for readers of
online vs. print versions.  Doc writers MUST be able to specify list
numbering, no two ways about it.

We _could_ avoid reinventing the wheel here: The ISO standard
ISO 8601:1991 "Data elements and interchange formats -
Information interchange - Representation of dates and times"
was designed to solve all the above (and other) problems.
Please take a look at it before you invent something else.

The full format for a time+date spec is aprox. as formely
exemplified:

	1993-08-03T00:21:33+0200 (my time zone)
	1993-08-02T22:21:33Z (UTC)
	19930802T222133Z (UTC, shorter form)

I don't have the standard at hand now but can quote more from
it tomorrow if you are interested.

I know this is a problem. there are many people that want to keep
html a clean language, not allowing formatting info inside a document
(see the discussion about poems and now about the numbers on an <ol>).

Just as someone editting the soviet exhibit at this very moment (the
final touch) I can tell you that I, as a writer of the docs, use
every trick I can to do some formatting. One of the tricks is to
use invisible images that use up space, and therefore can determine the
formatting on a particular browser (xmosaic in this case).

You might say: "don't do that frans or we'll shoot you", but on the
other hand, when it is clear that there is a need for this type of
formatting, why not provide it (instead of making me use nasty tricks)

providing formatting (not by semantics, but simply by position) can be
very nice, and if a browser does not like it, it can skip it (after all
that is the current situation). Docs with invisible image to do
the formatting are much harder to handle on browser that really insist
on handling their own formatting.

There is a working group for a common calendaring API; I suspect they'll
deal with the issue of a common date representation format since you need
that as a base. eowens@ccmail.com (Ed Owens) is the main contact and
there's a meeting prior to Interop on August 23rd for this group. I'm
hoping that a MIME subtype can be established that would simplify
exchanging calendar information. Lesley Schroeder (sp?) at (408) 446-9158
can get more information to you.

A simple DATE format for HTML is worthwhile, but an elaborate set of date
representations will just end up duplicating efforts. A better approach
might be to get URLs into the calendaring API :)

Well, don't.  Or call the format you're using something else, such as
application/xmosaic.

I completely agree.  The point is that there are many many formats which
do provide this capability.  Simply use one of them (MS-Word,
Postscript, FrameMaker MIF, TeX, troff, etc.), instead of trying to use
a format which does not provide this  kind of thing.  The other point is
that while almost all current markup formats are gunked up with
procedural formatting, HTML isn't (too much).  It would be nice if there
was *one* format which didn't have these procedural formatting warts.

Dave Raggett is doing a pretty good job of minimizing the amount of
procedural markup that's going into HTML+, which is great!

I am reminded that there is a very nice paper that answers this question
quite clearly:

    Coombs, Renear, & DeRose, "Markup Systems and the Future of
    Scholarly Text Processing", CACM Nov 1987.

I think if everyone on this list would read it, the reasons for
maintaining HTML as it was would be abundantly clear.

The trouble is that there is a need for hypertext markup that has
procedural elements.  I want to write hypertext, *and* specify some of
the output (starting a list at (e) for instance).

You would have me write in Postscript or TeX or some other format that
doesn't have hypertext ability, or write in HTML which doesn't have
presentation capabilities.  You are effectively preventing me from
doing something, and this isn't on.

SGML's non-procedural emphasis comes from the need to use texts for
multiple purposes --- it's easier to know how to create an index if
the headings are marked as ``headings'' rather than as ``some text at
14 pt Palatino''.  HTML will be used for a variety of purposes, but
none of those purposes (as far as I know) precludes a limited set of
procedural elements.  Please enlighten me if I am labouring under a
misapprehension.

HTML[+] is not, and doesn't seem likely ever to be, a language for
presentation-independent documents.  It's designed for interactive
browsing by humans and possible indexing by a computer, and as such
should be tailored for these purposes.  Anything else is subverting
the goals of HTML[+].

This is just a little rant about two style issues in hypertext that
I'm seeing more of and don't like much.

The first is the _here_ syndrome, e.g.: 

	Information about Blah Blah Blah is available by clicking _here_.

where the word _here_ is the link. This style is really awkward; when
you click on 'here', you have to look around to make sure it is the
*right* here. Let me urge you, when you construct your HTML page, to
make sure that the thing-you-click is actually some kind of title for
what it is when you click there. E.g.  say

	Information about _Blah Blah Blah_ is now available.

And use:

	Information on _how to do searches_ is available.

instead of

	For information on how to do searches, choose _this link_.


================================================================
Not quite as bad, but still awkward is where someone will use a topic
word as a link, but it still talks about the links:

   Here are links to a _CREDITS_ page and _technical details_ ...

Instead, try to write something like

   Many thanks go to _various people_ for their contributions.
   _Technical details_ of this system are available now.

I.e., make your HTML page such that you can read it even if you don't
follow any links.

I only ask that instead of simply saying, "Start the list with (e)", you
say what you mean; that is, *why* the list should start with (e).

> You are effectively preventing me from doing something, and this isn't on.

But you are preventing *me* from doing something, if you add procedural
markup.  Is your cause more just than mine?

And both of these purposes are better served by *generic* markup than
procedural.  Procedural markup shines in many places where you don't
want the reader to be able to control the presentation (that is, since
he doesn't know why that list starts at (e), he can't instruct his
browser to present it in a form more amenable to his personal handicaps
or advantages), or when you don't care if they understand the text: 
Advertising, or propaganda, or many forms of rhetoric.  Art (poetry!).

Again, this is not just random
who-likes-which-kind-of-markup-format-better.  Please read the article
I've cited.

Anyone going to get upset if I rip out "Window Per Document" for
Mosaic 2.0?  (Middle button would still cause new windows to appear,
and "New Window" and "Clone Window" would still work.)

Please send me mail directly, and only if this would really tear you
up.

Thanks,

Status: RO

......ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/prerelease.  Source, plus binaries
for Sun, IBM, SGI.

This prerelease fixes problems with prerelease 0.  Changes include:

 o Fixes for PostScript printing on non-SGI's and in general.  
 o Moved "Search Index" button to left side of window.  
 o Fixed problems keeping img.c from compiling without HDF support.  
 o Ripped out Documents, Manuals.  
 o Better Gopher icons (thanks, Kevin Hughes).  
 o Removed hardcoding of location of help documents.  Here's how things
   work now: By default, the www.ncsa.uiuc.edu location is used.  This can be
   overridden in src/Makefile by setting the DOCS_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT
   define.  This can in turn be overridden by the environment variable
   MOSAIC_DOCS_DIRECTORY environment variable, which can in turn be
   overridden by the XMosaic*DocsDirectory X resource (which by default is
   NULL).  How's that?  
 o Home page is now customizable at compile time by setting
   -DHOME_PAGE_DEFAULT to any URL.  
 o Other things that are customizable at compile time (see src/mosaic.h): 
    o WHATSNEW_PAGE_DEFAULT 
    o DEMO_PAGE_DEFAULT 
    o HTMLPRIMER_PAGE_DEFAULT 
    o URLPRIMER_PAGE_DEFAULT 
 o Removed native DMF support.  
 o Reading a .HDF file that's not an HDF/netCDF file no longer exits on
   "ncopen: Not a netcdf file".  

No libwww2 support, yet.  (In the middle of working on it.)

See README and README-HDF on the FTP server for more info.  Comments
and feedback appreciated -- THIS IS UNSUPPORTED CODE, however; if you
want stability, get Mosaic 1.2 (/Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries and
/Mosaic/xmosaic-source).

Cheers,
Marc

I think that sums it up quite well, and is a great rule of thumb.

I'm strongly in agreement.

Point well taken, but here is a devil's advocate exception:
For initial pages and for some menus, the click _here_ business
makes sense.  It's a way to make things clear for folks new to
the Web and to hypertext in general.  Yes, I know: folks should
be able to pick that up quickly on a demo page.  But all of our
home pages will be demo pages for some new users.

Furthermore:  Even if it's readable, it's still sometimes silly.
Example:  Here at MSU some colleagues have set up "Personal Pages"
with online data including photos, resumes, etc.  One colleague
has the following two lines:

   My _contact information_ is available.
   My _personal data_ is available.

It's readable English, but not really much more sensical than
"Click _here_ for my contact information."  It might be better
to just go with a short menu:

  Here are more documents you might want to look at:
    _Personal Data_
    _Contact Information_
    ...

;;;
;;; html-mode: Major mode for editing HTML hypertext documents.
;;; Revision: 2.1 (beta)
;;;
;;; Changes from 2.0 (beta):
;;;   - Ripped out numeric anchor name stuff altogether (all names should be
;;;     meaningful, not just numbers).
;;;   - Fixed problem with unquoted names.
;;;   - Fixed font-lock support (yeah! thanks lamour@engin.umich.edu).
;;;
;;; ------------------------------ INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------
;;;
;;; Put the following code in your .emacs file:
;;;
;;; (autoload 'html-mode "html-mode" "HTML major mode." t)
;;; (or (assoc "\\.html$" auto-mode-alist)
;;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.html$" . html-mode) 
;;;                               auto-mode-alist)))
;;;
;;; Emacs will detect the ``.html'' suffix and activate html-mode
;;; appropriately.
;;;
;;; You are assumed to be at least somewhat familiar with the HTML
;;; format.  If you aren't, read about it first (see below).
;;;
;;; Here are key sequences and corresponding commands:
;;;
;;; NORMAL COMMANDS:
;;;
;;; C-c a         html-add-address
;;;   Open an address element.
;;;
;;; C-c b         html-add-blockquote
;;;
;;; C-c C-b       html-add-bold
;;;   Open a bold element.
;;;
;;; C-c c         html-add-code
;;;   Open a 'code' (fixed-font) element.
;;;
;;; C-c C-c       html-add-citation
;;;
;;; C-c d         html-add-description-list
;;;   Open a definition list.  The initial entry is created for you.
;;;   To create subsequent entries, use 'C-c e'.
;;;
;;; C-c e         html-add-description-entry
;;;   Add a new definition entry in a definition list.  You are
;;;   assumed to be inside a definition list (specifically, at the end
;;;   of another definition entry).
;;;
;;; C-c C-e       html-add-emphasized
;;;   Open an emphasized element.
;;;
;;; C-c C-f       html-add-fixed
;;;
;;; C-c g         html-add-img
;;;   Add an IMG element (inlined image or graphic).  Note that the
;;;   IMG tag is currently an extension to HTML supported only by the
;;;   NCSA Mosaic browser (to my knowledge).  You will be prompted for
;;;   the URL of the image you wish to inline into the document.
;;;
;;; C-c h         html-add-header
;;;   Add a header.  You are prompted for size (1 is biggest, 2 is
;;;   next biggest; bottom limit is 6) and header contents.
;;;
;;; C-c i         html-add-list-or-menu-item
;;;   Add a new list or menu item in a list or menu.  You are assumed
;;;   to be inside a list or menu (specifically, at the end of another
;;;   item).
;;;
;;; C-c C-i       html-add-italic
;;;   Open an italic element.
;;;
;;; C-c C-k       html-add-keyboard
;;;
;;; C-c l         html-add-normal-link
;;;   Add a link.  You will be prompted for the link (any string;
;;;   e.g., http://foo.bar/argh/blagh).  The cursor will be left where
;;;   you can type the text that will represent the link in the
;;;   document.
;;;
;;; C-c C-l       html-add-listing
;;;
;;; C-c m         html-add-menu
;;;   Open a menu.  The initial item is created for you.  To create
;;;   additional items, use 'C-c i'.
;;;
;;; C-c C-m       html-add-sample
;;;
;;; C-c n         html-add-numbered-list
;;;
;;; C-c p         html-add-paragraph-separator
;;;   Use this command at the end of each paragraph.
;;; 
;;; C-c C-p       html-add-preformatted
;;;
;;; C-c r         html-add-normal-reference
;;;
;;; C-c s         html-add-list
;;;   Open a list.  The initial item is created for you.  To create
;;;   additional items, use 'C-c i'.
;;;
;;; C-c C-s       html-add-strong
;;;
;;; C-c t         html-add-title
;;;   Add a title to the document.  You will be prompted for the
;;;   contents of the title.  If a title already exists at the very
;;;   top of the document, the existing contents will be replaced.
;;;
;;; C-c C-v       html-add-variable
;;;
;;; C-c x         html-add-plaintext
;;;   Add plaintext.  The cursor will be positioned where you can type
;;;   plaintext (or insert another file, or whatever).
;;;
;;; C-c z         html-preview-document
;;;   Fork off a Mosaic process to preview the current document.
;;;   After you do this once, subsequent invocations of
;;;   html-preview-document will cause the same Mosaic process to be
;;;   used; this magic is accomplished through Mosaic's ability to be
;;;   remote-controlled via Unix signals.  This feature is only
;;;   available when running Lucid Emacs v19 (it will maybe work with
;;;   GNU Emacs v19; I'm not sure).
;;;
;;; COMMANDS THAT OPERATE ON THE CURRENT REGION:
;;;
;;; C-c C-r l     html-add-normal-link-to-region
;;;   Add a link that will be represented by the current region.  You
;;;   will be prompted for the link (any string, as with
;;;   html-add-normal-link).
;;;
;;; C-c C-r r     html-add-reference-to-region
;;;   Add a reference (a link that does not reference anything) that
;;;   will be represented by the current region.  You will be prompted
;;;   for the name of the link.
;;;
;;; SPECIAL COMMANDS:
;;;
;;; <, >, &
;;;   These are overridden to output &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;
;;;   respectively.  The real characters <, >, and & can be entered
;;;   into the text either by typing 'C-c' before typing the character
;;;   or by using the Emacs quoted-insert (C-q) command.
;;;
;;; C-c <, C-c >, C-c &
;;;   See '<, >, &' above.
;;;
;;; ---------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------
;;;
;;; If you are running Epoch or Lucid Emacs, highlighting will be used
;;; to deemphasize HTML message elements as they are created.  You can
;;; turn this off; see the variables 'html-use-highlighting' and 
;;; 'html-use-font-lock'.
;;;
;;; HREF and NAME arguments in anchors should always be quoted.  In
;;; some existing HTML documents, they are not.  html-mode will
;;; automatically quotify all such unquoted arguments when it
;;; encounters them.  The following variables affect this behavior.
;;;
;;; html-quotify-hrefs-on-find       (variable, default t)
;;;   If this is non-nil, all HREF arguments will be quotified
;;;   automatically when a HTML document is loaded into Emacs
;;;   (actually when html-mode is entered).
;;;
;;; -------------------------------- GOTCHAS ---------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML documents can be tricky.  html-mode is not smart enough to
;;; enforce correctness or sanity, so you have to do that yourself.
;;;
;;; ------------------------- WHAT HTML-MODE IS NOT --------------------------
;;;
;;; html-mode is not a mode for *browsing* HTML documents.  In
;;; particular, html-mode provides no hypertext or World Wide Web
;;; capabilities.
;;;
;;; The World Wide Web browser we (naturally) recommend is NCSA
;;; Mosaic, which can be found at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic.
;;;
;;; See file://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3 for w3.el, which is
;;; an Elisp World Wide Web browser written by William Perry.
;;;
;;; ------------------------------ WHAT HTML IS ------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a format for hypertext
;;; documents, particularly in the World Wide Web system.  For more
;;; information on HTML, telnet to info.cern.ch or pick up a copy of
;;; NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System via ftp to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu

When I first started constructing HTML documents recently I looked
around for some guidance as to style - like was it prefered that you
use "Click here" or embed links more subtly? I saw examples of both so
was unsure which might be considered better style. My instincts follow
Larry but I sometimes found it hard to construct an appropriatly
grammatical sentence.  A document which showed a variety of examples
of preferred styles for presenting links would be extremely helpful
for beginners. I expected to find such examples in the "style guide"
in the World Wide Web project information, but no such luck.

Before explaining how this might be done, I want to argue that this is
problem is an artifact and will disappear with HTML+

Most hypertext links in documents act as cross references, and are pertinent
to the part of the document in which they appear. General navigation links
such as up, next and prev apply to the document node as a whole. These links
should be defined with the LINK element, and the HTML+ spec suggests that
they appear on a toolbar or navigation menu. They are then available even
when the user has scrolled down several windowfuls. Using the LINK element in
this way makes the whole problem go away!

The HTML+ spec also describes a way of defining such links implicitly, whereby
they are inferred from the context. This is useful for large documents which
span a large number of HTML+ nodes.

The simplest way to indicate which parts are for online/printing use only
would be to define new tags, e.g.

 <online> online use only </online> <print> used only when printing </print>

This seems quite elegant to me. However, the SGML standard suggests you
use marked sections for ignoring given sections during certain processing runs.

To use SGML marked sections, the *browser* (not the document) needs to include
two entity definitions which depend on whether the HTML+ document is being
printed or viewed online.

    For online use:

        <!ENTITY % online "INCLUDE">
        <!ENTITY % print "IGNORE">

    For printing:

        <!ENTITY % online "IGNORE">
        <!ENTITY % print "INCLUDE">

The document then includes marked sections:

    <![%online; [ -- put markup for online use here -- ]]>
    <![%print;  [ -- put markup for printing only here -- ]]>

The SGML parser then ignores marked sections starting with "<![IGNORE ["
but includes marked sections starting with "<![INCLUDE [".

Please let me know if my description of links in the HTML+ spec is unclear.
My somewhat concise writing style is probably confusing folks.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

One thing I'm sure of: the word "click" is not correct, since it
doesn't help anyone with a dumb terminal using www or lynx, where the
action is "enter number" or "press return". The action shouldn't be
described in the document, unless it is genuinely an introduction to
using hypertext for a particular (set of) browser(s).

I also dislike "here" as a link; I try to use the actual topic.

e.g. Here is <a href=prl.gif>a picture of me</a>
NOT  A picture of me is <a href=prl.gif>here</a>

Personally, I would remove the introductory "Here is" from the first
example, unless it's part of a sentence, but then I prefer things terse.

Since we're discussing style, how about these...

Where a doc refers to a subject (e.g. it's author) several times,
should there be links to the description of that subject on every
mention, or just the first, or the "defining use" or what? I went
through a phase of putting in a link to my description on every use of
"me" or "I". Now I just tend to initial a doc at the bottom and put the
link to ./prl.html in there.

As an institution, we have a logo, and a policy that all published docs
bear our logo. Is it reasonable to include this on all HTML docs
(possibly by hacking out HTTP server)? Similarly, is it a Good Thing to
hack our HTTP server to automatically "sign" all documents by looking
at the owner of the file, and appending a link to that user's
description, if there is one?

Subject: Re: yet another tag
Status: RO


In response to Frans' suggestion (for markup to indicate that
certain elements not be rendered when printing to paper):

I suggest a variation that accomplishes the same end.  The
markup should instead indicate that the element it applies
to is intended for interactive purposes rather than part of
the document proper.   Then we can let the printing program
decide not to render elements which are interactive on the
grounds that the human reading the printed version would
not be able to interact with the paper. 

On the other hand as D. Ragget points out this specific kind
of artifact Hoesel was thinking of gets special treatment in
HTML+ so the need will go away.  And also, it seems to me
that one might wish to print the littlke arrows anyway, as
for instance when you want to capture a screen snapshot for
presentation elsewhere.  (On the other hand, perhaps in that
case one should use a screen capture tool, not expect a WWW
browser to print it for you that way.  I complely agree that
I don't want the little arrows in my book.)

PS. The assumption that paper is not interactive will
become false someday, see the article by P Wellner in
the July CACM (p 86): Interacting with Paper on the DigitalDesk.

Subject: comments on HTML+ draft RFC
Status: RO

Let me begin by thanking Dave Ragget (and others) for the great effort
in creating the ideas and the document.  HTML+ has some powerful
features I am eager to see come into existance.  It also has a few
design decisions I would like to question...


The most important comment I have is that there is too much emphasis
on rendering.  In the draft RFC, description of a feature is often
accompanied by some discussion of how it might be rendered.  For a
particularly strong example, see the roles for the P tag.  Now either
these hints are part of the specification or they are not.  If they
are not, then they should go into an appendix.  (I feel strongly
enough about this that I will even volunteer to do this myself if you
send me the MS Word doc.)

As a further point re rendering hints, consider, please, that some of
the Internet community is blind.  Do you want to include hints to
writers of audio browsers also?

Other comments and questions, in order by section:

Re: Normal Text

why a citation better conveyed by <em role="cite"> than <cite>

Are the roles (which are English words) also to be used in documents
not written in English?

the "footnote" and "margin" roles of em are not roles, that is they
don't describe semantics, they are rendering hints.  Again, I won't
argue whether or how much HTML+ should support rendering but can we
at least agree to call hints hints and roles roles?  There is some
underlying semantics here, namely that the foot note is a comment
on the immediately preceding text; and that both are a kind of
digression.  But the decision to place at bottom of page or in the
margin is purely rendering.

I suggest that roles be spelled out, not abbreviated as in e.g.
"dfn" for "definition" or "kbd" for "typein".

the optional rendering hints for typeface (hv and tr) are mis named.
If the meaning is supposed to be "sans serif font" or "serif font"
then why not instead have face=sans-serif and face=serif.  Or
serif=yes/no?

<hr> is rendering.

when specifying size of a text field for input, which font is used for
the character units of the width and height?

for role=byline - what's the scope of this?  the whole document, the next section?


Re tabs in PRE - if someone specifies tabs with the tab tag, does this
replace the built-in tab stops at every eight characters?

General comments

In many places the document tells us that an id field can be used.  It
would be nice to have a full list of all possible places.  Should we
assume that an id is only permitted where the doc explicitly says it
may go?

The FIGD tag "allows you to give a textual description which can be
shown when the figure itself can't be".  But may/should a browser show
the material in a FIGD tag when it CAN show the figure?

Re: ISMAP.  Shouldn't the encoding also specify *which* mouse button
was pressed?

You should delete the sentence that says ISMAP is slow.  That's not
part of the spec, is it?

Re: Tables:  Why not spell it as <table> instead of <tbl>

Can one use id to refer to a table?  Can table elements include an A tag?

The first "guideline" says: "There is no need to declare empty cells
at the end of a row".  But this is certainly not a guideline, e.g. it
is not something that a browser is free to ignore.  A browser which
does so is, I think, in error.

Can a table have more than one <tt>?  Must all <tt> be before all <th>?

It seems that the designer of this feature must have intended some
semantics which the example hints at but the spec does not mention.
Note that the first two lines of the table have only three entries
(line 1 has two entries, the first spanning two columns), yet they
begin in column 2, not column 1.  I am just guessing, but perhaps
the designer intended  or assumed that one column would be reserved
on these two "header" lines, to be used below by the row headers.
As a further guess, the table's "data" begins with the first line
that contains a <td> instead of just a <th>?  And if there's a <th>
on such a line, it's a row header, and goes into this reserved
first column?

My guesses are no doubt wrong, but perhaps the document can be
extended to say what is really true?

Maybe instead of using <th> for both the column headers (in this case,
height, weight, category) and row headers (males, females) we should
have separate tags?

the <tb> tag is pure rendering.

It would be nice if the RFC had a table of contents and an index, as it
is likely to eventually become the reference manual for HTML+

It would be nice if there were section and subsection numbers

   Well, since I just started adding HTML+ capabilities to my emacs
browser, I think I should hop in here.  :)

   If I am reading your sentence correctly, you think this means a
table could look like this:

    | HEADER  	    | HEADER	    |	HEADER	|
    | data  	    | data  	    |	    	    	<-- no 3rd column
    | data  	    | data  	    | Data  	|
    [...]

    If so, then I think you read the HTML+ spec wrong - there is no
need for the _author_ to specify every column of data.  I think it
would be silly for browser writers not to fill it in.  Although I hope
WYSIWYG editors won't leave too much of this out.

>Can a table have more than one <tt>?  Must all <tt> be before all
><th>?

   Good question.  I've got table formatting done, in a very basic
way, and I assumed there could be only one <TT> - didn't matter where
it was.

    If you check the tables source, you'll notice that there are empty
<TH> tags at the start of those lines.  So there is really a ' ' in
the empty header. :)

    Right now, when a table is formatted, I threw in support for a
"s=##" tag for <TD> elements also.  (Whole 3 lines of code :)  Anyone
think this should be in the spec?  Not sure when it would be useful,
but you never know.

>Maybe instead of using <th> for both the column headers (in this
>case, height, weight, category) and row headers (males, females) we
>should have separate tags?

    The "male" and "female" labels are just data elements, and look
like row headings because of the blank '<TH>' above them.  I think
this is the way to go.  Although right now the way I ave it written
you could do something like:

<TH> Some header <TD> blah <TD> blah <TR>

and it would turn out ok.  Is this going to be legal HTML+?

    I had a few questions about the HTML+ spec too, specifically with
tables.

Are we going to let people put tags in a table?  I would vote against
it, just so my life could be easier, since I don't use the common code
library.  Imagine a table that looks like this:

    +---------------+--------------+------------+--------------+
    | 	    	    | 	    	Average	    	| Other	       |
    +---------------+--------------+------------+--------------+
    | 	    	    | height	   | weight    	| Category     |
    +---------------+--------------+------------+--------------+
    | males 	    | 1.9   	   | 0.003      | <A HREF=     |
    | 	    	    |	    	   |	    	| "some.html"  |
    |	    	    |	    	   |	    	| >Text</A>    |
    +---------------+--------------+------------+--------------+
    | females       | 1.7   	   | 0.002      | yyy          |
    +---------------+--------------+------------+--------------+

    In my case, this is what it would look like after formatting the
table, but nothing else.  Now, say I go to parse the links - no way.
The link text has to be consecutive - it can be across 500 lines of
text if need be, but it should be 
<A HREF=
"some.html"
>
Text</A>, whith nothing between the = and " but whitespace and/or
newlines.  (Same with " and >, > and Text, etc)  Even if I could parse
that out, the depth of the table would change from 3 lines for males
to 1 line for males, and then you get into lots of nasty stuff like
checking 2 or 3 times to see if the table has changed size (after
making headings, after making links, after making lists, etc)  Makes
me wish emacs had a 'narrow-to-rectangle' function, then it wouldn't
be a problem. :)

    I'm not sure if anyone else out there is not able to use the
common code parser, but if so, please chime in.  I think it would be
more appropriate to have the link above replaced with something after
the table like: More information on <A HREF="some.html">Males data</A>
is available.  (Worded better, but similar :)

    Any comments?

Subject: Re: Presentation and Semantics debate
Status: RO

I don't understand.  Why should presentation elements be excluded as
antithetical to semantic markup?  This seems unnecessary.  It seems
that the argument is that if there is *any* kind of presentation-level
formatting in a document, the document becomes somehow "unclean".  Presumably,
this is because the document has had information added to it that is not
accessible by automatic document processing software.

So?  

The information is (still) for human consumption.  I can envision systems
which would allow wonderful things to be done in an automatic fashion by 
computer information systems, but then we would all be writing in something akin
to Lisp.  When I write a document, I can throw in puns, jokes, statements 
that make no sense without cultural referents, etc.  This may obscure some
semantics from those who do not share the culture (or the language!), but
that's life.   Things are better than that in HTML[+]* at the level we're
discussing, because the added information need not obscure any semantic
tagging that would be present in the DTD and the document.

I think that HTML[+]* should have as rich a semantic markup schema as is
possible.  Put in there every conceivable kind of document element you
can think of.  Put in links so that a semantic net can be created over
a set of HTML documents.  Put in a powerful equation system.  Go to town.
Then, when you are done, allow all kinds of formatting "hints" which everyone
is free to ignore if they want, but which will allow for professional
appearing documents in something like NCSA Mosaic.

The alternative will be for people to start writing their documents in
somewhat less structured formats.  Like PostScript.  Or GIF.  Don't make
us do this.  If HTML[+]* does not provide for flexibility in this area,
it should *not* be the global hypermedia system.  Something like Acrobat
with hyper-extensions might better serve the need for a rich universal
document structure.

Attitudes like "no formatting information unless there is a defined
semantic purpose for it (and it had better be in the DTD)" are understandable,
they really are, and I applaud the intent.  But why is it necessary to be
so rigid?  As long as semantic formatting information is embodied by HTML[+]* 
constructs to the best extent possible, why not allow those constructs to
have a wide range of optionally observed formatting attributes?

Baby for the bath water, etc.

HTML+ includes rendering hints and when they are recognised by browsers, they
should be treated in a predictable/consistent way. It makes sense to describe
these, in the minimal fashion needed for such consistency, at the point in
which the relevant attribute is introduced.

Perhaps the suggestions are too vague or too strong - please let me know.

That sounds an interesting area to experiment with! It looks (sic) like
further work is needed before we can come up with hints to writers of audio
browsers. This seems to me more suitable for a later informational RFC.

> why a citation better conveyed by <em role="cite"> than <cite>

There are many potential logical emphasis tags like "cite". The EM mechanism
is intended to prevent an explosion of tag types. The combination of logical
and physical emphasis into a single element means that browsers can deal
sensibly with emphasis even when it doesn't recognise the logical category
involved. It gives us open ended logical categories with rendering hints.

Yes, just like you have to use the same tag names. WYSIWYG editors would
hide this from people though.

I agree that this is bending the scheme somewhat. Perhaps one could make

Maybe. I chose these names for brevity and compatibility with HTML.
What do other people feel about this?

Thats right. Browsers could ignore it if they want.

The font to be used in the field itself. For variable pitch fonts it makes
sense to use the width of the largest character. Alternatively, browsers
should allow the field to scroll sideways, as is common on many GUIs.

The spec says "information about the author of the document".

If there are more tabs on a given line than tab stops, then the extra tabs
can be treated with the default every 8 character tab stops. This is the way
it works with Microsoft Word. I haven't tried other packages.

The DTD is the authority on this matter.

A reasonable idea is to show this text while waiting to retrieve the figure
data itself.

No, some systems only have one mouse button. I guess suggesting the left

Thank you. Its a hangover from an earlier draft - well past its read-by date!

I did in earlier versions, but TBL seemed more in line with the other tags.

The row separator unambiguously defines where one row ends and the next
begins. This suggestion will make browsers more robust. I will move it
to a better place.

> Can a table have more than one <tt>?  Must all <tt> be before all <th>?

The DTD makes it clear that only one is permitted, and that it must be
directly following <tbl>.

The spec is perhaps too concise. In the first row,

        <th rowspan=2><th colspan=2>average<th>other

The first cell is empty and merged with the next row (rowspan=2). The
next cell spans 2 columns (colspan=2).

In the second row: <th>height<th>width<th>category

The first cell is implicit and carried over from the first row, by the
rowspan=2 attribute. This is explained in the footnote. I hope you can
see that each row provides definitions for all four columns. Note you
can mix TH and TD on the same row, e.g. when the first column contains
headers (TH = header cell, TD = data cell).

The complications arising from merged cells should be hidden by WYSIWYG
editors, but the general format is really quite simple (you should have
a look at other table formats!).

> the <tb> tag is pure rendering.

Yes, but worth having I think.

> Re: Link attributes.  Which if any of these attributes are mandatory?

For the A tag, only HREF, For the LINK tag ROLE is also needed to make sense.

OK I will try and create a table of contents and an index as you suggest.
I am not a fan, though, of section numbering.

I have been getting a number of other requests, and will need to revise the
spec fairly soon anyway, before it gets proposed formally as an Internet
Draft.

Many thanks for your comments,

OK, world, configurable menubars are going in.  I give up.

And yes, as I said earlier, the contents of the previous Documents and
Manuals menus are going to be in a document accessible from the home
page when I get a free minute to sit back and actually write some
HTML.

Subject: Hello World.PDF
Cc: Paul Holbrook <holbrook@cic.net>, uri@bunyip.com
Status: RO

This is hardly a fair metric!  It's like saying a C compiler is
inefficient 'cause it produces binaries that are 1200K in size
just to say Hello World, so let's use Microsoft Basic instead.

I have taken a 5 page document including a couple of diagrams and
run it through the Distiller.  The resulting file was 57K in size.
The original file in MS Word was 82K.  A flat Postscript version of
the same document was 118K.   Word counts 13.5K words in the document;
when saved as flat ASCII text it's 14K long.

The point is that you cannot extrapolate from a trivial example to
anything meaningful.   A rule of thumb from Adobe is that documents
without a lot of fancy diagrams are only about 25% larger than the
underlying flat ASCII files; I haven't measured that with text-only
documents.

And of course the stuff is not human readable -- that's not the purpose,
and it'd be impossible to provide this kind of functionality in
readable text.  JPEG files aren't readable either.

The Acrobat Starter kit is relatively cheap, especially for educational
institutions.  I've begun playing with the stuff and feel I've got a
lot to learn before any evaluations can be made.  I'd urge other sites
to get hold of the kit or wait for careful evaluations in the trade
rags before jumping to conclusions.

PS -- Has an Acrobat news group started anywhere?  Rather than spilling
this discussion into a bunch of newsgroups that already have plenty
to talk about, should we find one or create alt.acrobat?

----------------------------Original message----------------------------
Below is a PDF file I created on a Macintosh. I did this because many
people probably haven't seen the heart of the PDF beast yet ;> It doesn't
get much simpler. All the file contained was "Hello World" without the
quotes to be printed on an 8.5" x 11" page. I made the typeface Courier, so
that the PDF file wouldn't contain lots of font metric information, if I
would have used a TrueType font the file would have been much larger (about
2500 bytes for a scaleable font like TrueType Geneva). The point here is
that PDF is not simple, it is like a PostScript superset, oriented towards
presentation, not content. The files are fairly large; in this example the
11 characters of Hello World turned into a 942 character PDF file, almost
100 times larger than the original, of course I didn't use the LZW encoding
for the text :). Like PostScript, this is not very human readable.

I agree that "here" is often annoying. Two problems with this: 1)
on line-mode viewers, it isn't even syntatically correct and 2) it
essentially forces you to back up and read up the entire sentence since
the highlighted text is pretty much content-free.

For the few times that it does make sense, I suggest:

<A HREF="link">Click here</A> for more information. 

instead of

More information is <A HREF="link">here</A>.
(or Click <A HREF="link">here</A> for more information.)

By extending the anchor to include "Click", one makes it clearer
what the user is supposed to do, as well as enlarging the target area
to click.

I'll be the second to wail that not all users 'click' to select a
hypertext node. I've used WWW on a Liveboard (pen-based input), and
we've at least thought about speech input, as well as, of course, the
linemode browser.

Please, web-spinners, even if you want to make your pages pretty for
XMosaic users, make them *usable* for those with other mechanisms of
input.

One place where 'click here' seems to be appropriate might be in the
online documentation for XMosaic itself. Unfortunately, people look to
the 'home pages' not only for online help, but also examples of good
style. Instead of:

    <A HREF="link">Click here</A> for more information. 


Just:
    <MENU> <LI> <A HREF="link">More information.</A> </MENU>

might be preferable.

Subject: Deriving meaningful conventions
Status: RO

Firstly, let's realise that links are used for multiple semantic
reasons.  They provide (and this is probably not a complete taxonomy)
 -- definitions
	<A HREF="glossay/geek.html">Hackers</A> are a group of ...
 -- continuity
	Go back, up, or to the next page.
 -- depth
	Select this for more information on stoat theft in Brazil.
 -- tangents
	This was written by Nathan Torkington, who did his <A HREF=
	"...">thesis on paranoid stoat stuffers</A> ...
 -- navigation
	Select one of the following: ...

There is no one convention which will be applicable to all these uses
of <A HREF...>.  However, given the constraints:
 -- browser-independence,
 -- obviousness
and
 -- generality,

here is how I would go about designing each of those types of links.

DEFINITION
  This is very straight-forward; the word or phrase to be defined is
enclosed in the <A>...</A> tags.  It is absolutely excellent to find a
page like the UIUC OED page where practically every noun phrase is
linked, but because of the terrifyingly large amount of work that this
involves, I think tagging the first instance in each file is just as
acceptable as tagging every instance.
  A case might be made for tagging the first instance after each <A
NAME=...></A> anchor definition.

CONTINUITY
  I think a standard menu at the end works well for this, containing:
 -- a link to the previous page
 -- a link to the next page
 -- a link to the top of the current semantic level
 -- a link to the previous semantic level (section/chapter/book)
 -- a link to the next semantic level
 -- a link to the very start

For instance,

	<H1>Navigation</H1>

	Select an option from the list below:
	<UL>
	<LI> <A HREF="2-4.html">Go to the previous section</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="2-6.html">Go to the next section</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="2.html">Go to the start of this chapter</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="1.html">Go to the start of the previous chapter</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="3.html">Go to the start of the next chapter</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="home.html">Go to the start of the book</A>
	</UL>

DEPTH
  I use this term to refer to information that may help to understand
the debate or development of discussion, but which (once accepted or
understood) can be accepted as true and omitted.  This is a
mathematical lemma, for instance, or a reference that backs up a claim
you make.  I generally would advocate a parenthetical comment with a
link to the document, eg.

	Since the price of stoats has increased exponentially since
	1955 (see <A HREF="...">Hahner and Hofner, JNEM, 1988</A>),
	the cost of ...

or

	With fifteen voters, compulsory voting and two parties, one
	party must get at least seven votes (by <A ...>the Pigeon-Hole
	Principle</A>).

TANGENTS
  I draw a distinction between tangents and depth, based on the
relevance to the argument or theme development in the document the
link is from.  For instance, if I'm describing what's on TV tonight,
links to cast lists for each of the shows would be depth, but links to
other shows the actors have been in would be tangential.  There is
really no clear-cut method of identifying tangents, except to trust
the reader's intuition that tangential links are essentially
irrelevant to the current document's thread.

	<A ...>David Thorpe</A>, who played the lead in <A
	...>Wiggins</A>' <A ...>bowel</A>-shattering production of <A
	...>Hamlet</A> in the <A ...>1960s</A>

Some would say that tangents ought to be eradicated, but the reason we
call the WWW clients ``browsers'' is that we can browse the world of
knowledge without keeping to the strict confines of the paths of
argument.  If I had my way, careful authors would tag the tangents
specially to indicate frivolity or irrelevance.

NAVIGATION
  When arranging information for quick navigation, menus seem to me to
be best.  They can provide quick overviews of the destination of the
link, and are structured (vertically in most cases) so that the eye
can assimilate the whole in a comparatively short period of time.  I
advocate the <DL> and the <UL>:

	<H1>Our Campus</H1>

	A spiel about the campus should go here.<P>

	The following items of relevance to our campus are available
	for browsing:

	<DL>
	<DT><A HREF="grounds/home.html">Grounds<DD>The groundskeepers
	ensure a balance between buildings and nature is preserved.
	<DT><A HREF="map/home.html">Map<DD>An aerial photograph, taken
	in 1989 and enhanced by our graphics laboratory, provides the
	basis for this guide to the campus.
	...
	</DL>

When you use ULs, I advocate placing the text of the link near the
start of the <LI> so that the text of the links make sense.

CERN's menus are good, offering shortcuts to items two levels away ...

	<DT><A HREF="browser.html">Browser Menu<DD>Many browsers are
	available: <A HREF="cern.html">the cern line mode browser</A>,
	...
when the browser.html menu contains
	<DT><A HREF="cern.html">Cern LineMode Browser<DD>This browser
	is designed for terminals without full-screen capability ...


IN GENERAL

I always advocate placing meaningful text inside the <A>...</A> tags,
so that what the eye picks up as highlighted text provides an instant
clue to the destination.  If all the eye sees when it scans a list is
a bunch of HEREs, then the owner of the eye is forced to read when
they shouldn't have to --- most links (currently) are navigation
links, and users should be able to find documents they are interested
in with a minimum of wasted time.

Remember, these are just my opinions and preferences.  I've seen (but
god knows why) empty tags (<A HREF=...></A>) and other things that
defy explanation.  Authors have the power to create almost any
document they wish, and the Jedi Jury is still out on precisely what
is the Dark Side of hypertext.

Subject: <ISINDEX>
Status: RO

The <ISINDEX> tag is an indication to browsers that they should allow
the entry of search keywords.  If search words are entered, the
browser requests the same URL as the document with the <ISINDEX> tag,
but appends ?word+word+word.

For instance, URL http://foo.com/top.html has an <ISINDEX> tag in it.
If the user attempts to search this document for the keywords ``ox''
and ``stoat'', the browser will request the URL
http://foo.com/top.html?ox+stoat.  Note that the browser is not
performing the search; it simply requests a URL from a server.

The server must do the search.  The standard CERN server doesn't
search at the moment.  Plexus, the super sexy perl-based server does.
I have made crude and rude patches to allow searching, but they suck
and have been improved on by other people.

Your options, to perform searches, are:
 --- don't
 --- run a server that allows searches
 --- make a shell script that has the cover-page for the search (the
	page with the <ISINDEX> in it) and code to do the searching.
	Then run this from inetd on a different port to your standard
	server.  Then map from the old cover page to the new one with
	your server.
 --- wait until the new CERN server comes out which will allow
	searches.

Cheers;

Nat

No its not, as someone (Terry Allen?) pointed out.  It is absolutely
essential that some form of common reference be able to be used when
needed.

I read the article Bill cited, and I think that it is dealing with a
different situation than HTML is.  The article only talks of
situations where the style sheet controlling the output can be tweaked
by humans, to be read by humans.  In effect, all the descriptive
mark-up does in these situations is separate the semantics (the DTD)
from the presentation (the style sheet), and the authors fool with the
style-sheet until they get acceptable output.

This isn't what happens with HTML --- authors are stuck with what the
various browsers decide is an acceptable style sheet.  Because there
is no ``standard style sheet'' to give authors an idea what the output
will look like, presentation becomes almost random.  Now the
separation of semantics and presentation has taken control of
presentation away from authors who work in HTML.

The situations are not the same.  For this reason, this article can't
be cited as a reason why presentation should not be introduced into
HTML.

However, I have come to agree with Bill that presentation shouldn't be
incorporated into the descriptive markup --- for precisely the reasons
mentioned in the article: ease of authoring, ease of maintenance,
standardisation and alternate views.  However, I still maintain that
authors should be able to have some of the same control over
presentation that they have always had.

It seems to me that either
 -- we move to make the markup language exceptionally precise
    semantically --- that is, be able to tag every sense of emphasis
    and every sense of cross-reference, leaving presentation entirely
    up to the browser,
 -- we ship semantic and presentation information separately, or
 -- we create for ourselves a compromise language that encodes vague
    semantics, and provides presentation hints as well.

I believe that O'Reilly had some ideas for style sheets as part of
HTML a while ago --- could someone from that august organisation mail
me a copy of their proposal?

Nat.

Subject: Extensions to WWW
Status: RO

I am currently involved in writing a project proposal
for a RACE-project called CIO. In fact is a extension 
to an already existing project. The aim of this project
is to develop new services on top of ATM. 
The MOU-ATM, a european pilot ATM-network, will be established
in mid-94. The CIO project will use this network for 
piloting new services. CIO aims to develope protocols,
different multimedia services (mail, audio/video-conferencing) and
end user-applications. 

In the extension to this project we will now bring in new services 
and applications like interactive multimedia databases and virtual reality
in context of distributed virtual telemuseum. Several norwegian, swedish,
finnish and germans plan to participate in this new work package.

The Norwegian Telecom  Research are currently working with WWW and are
managing the norwegian home-page (which will be ready soon). We would
like to bring in WWW as a key technology in this RACE project. Some of the 
things that we love to see is:
  - Support for real-time audio and video communication  (not bulk-transfer)
    that allow CD-quality audio and high quality video (maybe HDTV) to
    be used.
  - Taxation
  - Security
  - Access-control
  - Porting HTTP to run over XTP

Can anyone tell me the future plans of WWW ? How should 
organizations proceed if they want to make extensions ?
Is there any formal kind of cordination in the development 
of WWW ?

Hiya everybody,

Me too.. I thought I better not complain, since nobody else mentioned
this problem, and I didn't want to add to the traffic of the list.

Say, while I'm here: What do you people think of starting a newsgroup?
It would be more convenient to use than a mailing list: One can select
articles by subject and filter out threads that are not interesting.
Another advantage would be that we would also have more people from the
Net "stumbling in" and perhaps could get them interested in WWW.

It is possible to keep a two-way gateway between a newsgroup and a mailing  
list, so that users could decide which service they prefer. 


What do you think?

I would like to suggest that people use the LINK tag (in HTML+) for this
purpose. This allows the browser to put such links on a toolbar or menu
which is available no matter which part of the current document you are
looking at, in other words, you can't scroll the navigation menu away.

This approach also has the benefit of allowing browsers to behave more
intelligently when printing documents out. In the HTML+ spec, I also
show how these links can be defined *IMPLICITLY* rather than having to
include them with every document.

Thanks to Nathan for an excellent analysis of link types.

Hiya everybody,

Me too.. I thought I better not complain, since nobody else mentioned
this problem, and I didn't want to add to the traffic of the list.

Say, while I'm here: What do you people think of starting a newsgroup?
It would be more convenient to use than a mailing list: One can select
articles by subject and filter out threads that are not interesting.
Another advantage would be that we would also have more people from the
Net "stumbling in" and perhaps could get them interested in WWW.

It is possible to keep a two-way gateway between a newsgroup and a mailing  
list, so that users could decide which service they prefer. 


What do you think?

>        </UL>

I would like to suggest that people use the LINK tag (in HTML+) for this
purpose. This allows the browser to put such links on a toolbar or menu
which is available no matter which part of the current document you are
looking at, in other words, you can't scroll the navigation menu away.

This approach also has the benefit of allowing browsers to behave more
intelligently when printing documents out. In the HTML+ spec, I also
show how these links can be defined *IMPLICITLY* rather than having to
include them with every document.

Thanks to Nathan for an excellent analysis of link types.

Subject: Extensions to WWW
Status: RO

I am currently involved in writing a project proposal
for a RACE-project called CIO. In fact is a extension 
to an already existing project. The aim of this project
is to develop new services on top of ATM. 
The MOU-ATM, a european pilot ATM-network, will be established
in mid-94. The CIO project will use this network for 
piloting new services. CIO aims to develope protocols,
different multimedia services (mail, audio/video-conferencing) and
end user-applications. 

In the extension to this project we will now bring in new services 
and applications like interactive multimedia databases and virtual reality
in context of distributed virtual telemuseum. Several norwegian, swedish,
finnish and germans plan to participate in this new work package.

The Norwegian Telecom  Research are currently working with WWW and are
managing the norwegian home-page (which will be ready soon). We would
like to bring in WWW as a key technology in this RACE project. Some of the 
things that we love to see is:
  - Support for real-time audio and video communication  (not bulk-transfer)
    that allow CD-quality audio and high quality video (maybe HDTV) to
    be used.
  - Taxation
  - Security
  - Access-control
  - Porting HTTP to run over XTP

Can anyone tell me the future plans of WWW ? How should 
organizations proceed if they want to make extensions ?
Is there any formal kind of cordination in the development 
of WWW ?

Thanks, Martin.. (sheepish grin :-)
Well, comp.infosystems.www is not carried here, and I haven't seen anybody
mentioning such a newsgroup, so I thought there wasn't any. Still, I think  
creating a gateway between this list and the newsgroup might be a good idea. 


Sorry for causing unnecessary traffic.

Me too.. I thought I better not complain, since nobody else mentioned
this problem, and I didn't want to add to the traffic of the list.

Say, while I'm here: What do you people think of starting a newsgroup?
It would be more convenient to use than a mailing list: One can select
articles by subject and filter out threads that are not interesting.
Another advantage would be that we would also have more people from the
Net "stumbling in" and perhaps could get them interested in WWW.

It is possible to keep a two-way gateway between a newsgroup and a mailing  
list, so that users could decide which service they prefer. 


What do you think?

I would like to suggest that people use the LINK tag (in HTML+) for this
purpose. This allows the browser to put such links on a toolbar or menu
which is available no matter which part of the current document you are
looking at, in other words, you can't scroll the navigation menu away.

This approach also has the benefit of allowing browsers to behave more
intelligently when printing documents out. In the HTML+ spec, I also
show how these links can be defined *IMPLICITLY* rather than having to
include them with every document.

Thanks to Nathan for an excellent analysis of link types.

Subject: Extensions to WWW
Status: RO

I am currently involved in writing a project proposal
for a RACE-project called CIO. In fact is a extension 
to an already existing project. The aim of this project
is to develop new services on top of ATM. 
The MOU-ATM, a european pilot ATM-network, will be established
in mid-94. The CIO project will use this network for 
piloting new services. CIO aims to develope protocols,
different multimedia services (mail, audio/video-conferencing) and
end user-applications. 

In the extension to this project we will now bring in new services 
and applications like interactive multimedia databases and virtual reality
in context of distributed virtual telemuseum. Several norwegian, swedish,
finnish and germans plan to participate in this new work package.

The Norwegian Telecom  Research are currently working with WWW and are
managing the norwegian home-page (which will be ready soon). We would
like to bring in WWW as a key technology in this RACE project. Some of the 
things that we love to see is:
  - Support for real-time audio and video communication  (not bulk-transfer)
    that allow CD-quality audio and high quality video (maybe HDTV) to
    be used.
  - Taxation
  - Security
  - Access-control
  - Porting HTTP to run over XTP

Can anyone tell me the future plans of WWW ? How should 
organizations proceed if they want to make extensions ?
Is there any formal kind of cordination in the development 
of WWW ?

OK, OK, before the flamefest starts, I didn't really look round properly. The
archive is at http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Archive/www-talk.archive

BUT it's the concatenation of EVERY mail ever received!!! C'mon, Tim,
give us a break! It took an hour and a half for poor little xmosaic to
display it (broken into 68 xmosaic "pages").

Any chance of an index? Catalogue? and each mail in a *separate* file?

I would like to suggest that people use the LINK tag (in HTML+) for this
purpose. This allows the browser to put such links on a toolbar or menu
which is available no matter which part of the current document you are
looking at, in other words, you can't scroll the navigation menu away.

This approach also has the benefit of allowing browsers to behave more
intelligently when printing documents out. In the HTML+ spec, I also
show how these links can be defined *IMPLICITLY* rather than having to
include them with every document.

Thanks to Nathan for an excellent analysis of link types.

Hi,

I have tried to find the last version of WAISGate and could not find it in any
of the expected files:
pub/www/src/WWWDaemon_2.07.tar or pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_2.09.tar

Anyone has an Idea where it is ???


Thanks

Well, I have an archive web accessible, but I haven't hacked on it in a while
and it is *very* buggy.

For now, the archive does

	- No indexing
	- Lists only the last 25 messages
	- and lets you read them
	- when it feels like it

When I get time, it will

	- work consistently (yeah, right)
	- allow you to do searches
	- allow you to access any message (not just the last 25)
	- have an even spleftier interface than it does now

For now though, have fun and look at it.  If it doesn't work, try it again
in half an hour. Sometimes it will only return blank pages and stuff, because
I haven't had time to debug it and I have a job. :-)

Subject: Servers for WWW/HTML?
Status: RO

Does server software exist to produce HTML marked up (Unix?) manual pages
on request? Presumably this sort of application would be generally useful, for
example for individual hardware manufacturers, program manuals, PC manuals etc.

In short, any type of on-line manual which has structured manual pages.

I am sure that there are servers around the world which do this, but it
would make sense if the software were distributed to take a load off the
host machines, and also to speed up access for end users, who would access
local rather than remote servers.

Here is basically what you need to do; change all occurrences of flock(...)
to &seize(...) and then add something like this in site.pl

do 'fcntl.ph';
eval 'sub F_RDLCK {1;}' unless defined &F_RDLCK;
eval 'sub F_WRLCK {3;}' unless defined &F_WRLCK;
eval 'sub F_SETLKW {9;}' unless defined &F_SETLKW;
$s_flock = "ssllss";		# struct flock {type, whence, start, len, pid}

sub seize {
    local($FH, $lock, $flock) = @_;
    $flock = pack($s_flock,
        ($lock == &LOCK_SH ? &F_RDLCK : &F_WRLCK), 0, 0, 0, 0);
    fcntl($FH, &F_SETLKW, $flock);
}

This code is untested so you will have to play around with it.

> why perl considers Plexus unsafe and refuses to use port 80?
You are running something like suidperl or taintperl.
Maybe you have Plexus suid root or something.

I thought that I was the only lucky person to get two copies of
every message.  Imagine the money I could make if I could only 
sell those extra copies of the www-talk messages. :)

want to hypertext link it to a different file- say sometool.html, how can 
I make the button "HOME" go to the original welcome.html file?
The help button will be a call to xmosaic http://some.cpu.com/sometool.html.
Does anyone have a better suggestion in doing this?

I know that setting the WWW_HOME environment will set the default
HOME page when issuing the xmosaic command.

Thanks.

Fork off Mosaic with the appropriate argument for the home page, and
then use the remote control feature to tell Mosaic where to go to get
the document you want the user to view at any given moment.  That way
you can run a single Mosaic as a child of your application that
handles all of the help functionality and is driven directly from the
application when the application needs it to do something.  See...

OK, I finally did it.  Version 0.5 of my man2www package which I have
told several people that I would make available "in a couple of weeks"
many months ago, is now available.  This may not be entirely what you
wanted, David, but I've been promising this for a while.  You can get
it from:

ftp.vifp.monash.edu.au:/pub/src/infosystems/www/man2www0.5.tar.gz

It converts UNIX manual pages to nicely formatted html.  Headings are
headings, italics are italics, formatting is not too bad, and
references to other manuals are hypertexted.  And it still has some
bugs.  I'll fix them if I ever get time.

It also probably makes copyright sense too.  I'm not sure about how
legal it is to make manual pages available to the world.  Some people
pay a lot for documentation.

Subject: Announcement: Latex to HTML v0.2 available
Status: RO


Version 0.1.2 of the Latex to HTML translator is now available.

Several bugs have been fixed and the format of the inlined images
has been changed from GIF to XBM. These look much better on color
monitors. Also the navigation icons are part of the distribution and
a new command line option can supress the navigation links at the top 
of each page.

Two short sections on how to embed hypertext links in a Latex document
and how to tell the translator of the syntax of unknown commands 
that should be ignored have been added to the documentation.

Several people have reported problems when using earlier versions 
of perl which impose tighter syntax restrictions. The translator
is known to work with version 4.0 (RCSfile: perl.c,v - 
Revision: 4.0.1.8 - Date:1993/02/05 19:39:30 - Patch level: 36).

Instructions on how to obtain and install the translator 
are available at:
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html

The postscript version of the above document (generated from the
same Latex source file) is available at:
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html.ps

I think the question you're asking is `How can I jump from another file to the
anchor "some anchor point" in the file "somefile.html"?'  If that's correct,
the answer is

Here's <a href="somefile.html#some anchor point">a link to an anchor.</a>

(Note absence of "click" terminology, which kettle of worms we've just been
over.)  The "anchor" part of the href ("#some anchor point") is appended to
the rest of the URL.

Thanks to Andy Whitcroft <andy@cs.city.ac.uk> for pointing this stuff
out.  I was in so much of a hurry to get the release done that I
mucked up a few things.

1) My message gave the wrong filename.
2) I missed out the devhtml directory.
3) I put the wrong perl script in the distribution.

The new version should hopefully fix all of these screw-ups.  It is
available from:

ftp.vifp.monash.edu.au:/pub/src/infosystems/www/man2html0.6.tar.gz

Apologies,
rik.

David Koblas <koblas@netcom.com> wrote a program called xpaint (current
version is 2.1.0).  You can pick it up from:
    ftp://export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib/xpaint-2.1.0.tar.Z
(nice net users will use archie to find a closer location)

It seems pretty functional if a little hard to use (hint: right mouse
button pops up menus for the icons which allow you to do things like
change brush and set the spray paint params).

Here is the README:


			 XPaint 2.1 Release


Welcome to the release of XPaint 2.1!  So, what does XPaint do for
you?  Why many wonderful things of course.  XPaint is a reasonably
versatile bitmap/pixmap editing tool.  XPaint came out of a problem
editing some very large bitmaps, and wanting more functionality then
was provided by bitmap. After XPaint 1.0 sat around for a LONG time, I
finally ended up with a strong need to edit color pixmaps.  Presto,
this is what has appeared from that problem.

The short features list:
	Usual paint operations:
		Brushes, Spray paint, Pencil
		Lines, Arcs, Pattern Fill, Text,

XPaint is slightly biased towards a MacPaint-like operation set, since
this is the only paint program that I have ever used for more than 30
seconds, but not to let this discourage you, it does quite a bit more.
If you find some functionality missing and feel like adding it, there
is a rough description of how the operations interface works, and I'd
be more that willing to help you.

The following file formats are supported:
	X11 Bitmaps	reading	writing
	PPM Format	reading writing
	GIF Format	reading writing
	PostScript		writing
	XPM Format	reading writing
	TIFF Format	reading writing (condinally compiled in)
	SGI RGB Format	reading writing (only on SGI machines)
If you have an image that is not in one of the supported formats I'd
reccomend you take a look at the PBMPLUS toolkit (which is availbe
for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu, and other fine sites).

XPaint is written using ANSI C (for the most part), and thus you need
to have a compiler that understands function prototypes.  On most MIPS
based machines this is the standard compiler, on a Sun SparcStation you
will either need to use 'gcc' or 'acc' (from Sun).  If you have some
other brand of workstation, try using 'gcc' if your compiler doesn't
work.

Hope you find this useful,

Subj:	rendering/semantics from TEI perspective

A week or so ago, I wrote a fairly lengthy set of comments on HTML, and
received a polite invitation to consider instead HTML+, from the point
of view of TEI conformance/convergence. Alas, I haven't had time to do
this as fully as I'd wish, but just to show I'm still here, I have a few
comments to make on the recent semantics/presentation discussion. I'll
do this by embedding comments from other recent notes (no names, no
packdrill)

1. Rendering Hints

There is some detailed discussion of the rendering vs. semantics issue
in chapter 6 of the TEI Guidelines and elsewhere. In the TEI dtd, every
element has a REND attribute which may be used to specify rendering
information in an as yet undefined manner. In addition, there is an
optional RENDITION element in the TEI header which may be used to
specify a default rendition style for any given element type. In the
future it seems probable that DSSSL will provide the tools needed to solve
this problem. 

There's a related interesting wrinkle to the problem not touched on in
discussion here, which the TEI has scratched its virtual head over:
suppose what you want to do is to encode the rendition *used by* an
original source -- not necessarily to reproduce it, but because (say)
you're interested in the history of printing or the effect of layout on
semantics. What kind of semantic markup scheme would you define for
that? We tried unsuccessfully to set up a work group for that last time
round -- maybe next time...

2. ROLE and EM

>The EM mechanism
>is intended to prevent an explosion of tag types. The combination of logical
>and physical emphasis into a single element means that browsers can deal
>sensibly with emphasis even when it doesn't recognise the logical category
>involved. It gives us open ended logical categories with rendering hints.

Oversimplifying, one could say that this ROLE attribute is sort of the
reverse of the TEI REND attribute. The difference (as someone else
pointed out) is that you might well want to constrain the places that
certain ROLEs are legal within your document, while you probably don't
want to constrain what's legal as a value for REND. To give a more
concrete example, if I decide to treat level 1 headings as  just another
kind of highlight, and tag them (in HTML+) <em role=heading1> then I'll
have problems finding all the level1 headings in my document to build a
table of contents, I won't be able to require that they appear in the
right place in the document hierarchy etc. If I encode them as 
<heading1 rend=head1-style>  or equivalent however, then I get the same
semantics, but I can now enforce any local rules I want to enforce
about where <heading1> is legal and where it is not.  

On general vs. specific purpose highlighting, the TEI has what I
consider to be the best proposal I've yet seen (but then I would, wouldnt
I): 

(a) Use specific/semantic tags where appropriate (examples in the TEI dtd
include foreign, emph, title, socalled, term ...) with an optional rend
attribute if you want to spell out how this particular element should be
rendered

(b) Where you want something highlighted without wishing to be specific
about the semantics, use the neutral <hi> element, again with an optional
rend attribute. 

<hi> is therefore almost synonymous with EM -- except that the ROLE
attribute would be regarded by many TEI hackers as an abomination second
only to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. Also, EM sounds a lot
too much like <emph> -- which in the TEI scheme has the very specific
semantics of <emph>linguistic</emph> emphasis, not necessarily
typographic. Typographic emphasis and linguistic emphasis do not
necessarily co-occur!

3. DTDs for visually-impaired access

> As a further point re rendering hints, consider, please, that some of
> the Internet community is blind.  Do you want to include hints to
> writers of audio browsers also?

There's quite a lot of work within the SGML community on defining a
general purpose DTD for sight-impaired access. I don't have the
reference handy but can provide it if this is of particular interest.

4. Names of elements

> Re: Tables:  Why not spell it as <table> instead of <tbl>
> I did in earlier versions, but TBL seemed more in line with the other tags.

>Someone else said that shorter tagnames were preferable "because we like
>TLAs". 

The TEI policy is to use self-explanatory names wherever possible, but
in general to make the length of a name inversely proportional to its
likely frequency of occurrence. Hence tags you're unlikely to come
across often tend to have self explanatory names -- so I would certainly
vote for <table> against <tbl>. And as a stickler for accuracy, I find
myself compelled to point out that "TLA" is short for "three letter
acronym" and that "tbl" (like most HTML tags) is not an acronym but an
abbreviation.

More later, I hope.

Folks:

As those of you who were in Cambridge know, I am mildly obsessive on
the subject of change bars in the new HTML spec.  The root of that
obsession is the need for legal people to compare successive versions
of texts (say, for laughs, the tax laws) to determine what, if any,
effects amendments will have/have had.  Note that this is not the same as
needing the "version currently in force", which is what you would want
in a man page, for example.  Both versions are needed for comparison
purposes.

Traditionally, of course, this is done by the so-called
"redline/strikeout" method in which the old version is rendered in one
way and the new version in another, somewhat interleaved.  
Generally this is done in a way
slightly more comprehensible than a diff-generated text, though the
granularity of comparisons varies widely depending on what software or
human means is used to do it.

The short version:

   A change bar spec which only shows the current version is, by
itself, inadequate for our purposes and probably for any discipline
where revision/versioning is important beyond needing to know only
_that_ something has changed rather than _how_ it has changed.
  At the risk of drawing a rain of fire on my head I would suggest
that one solution would be <em strikeout> or some such in conjunction
with the existing spec.

  It may also be worth thinking about the extensibility of whatever
this ends up being...since it seems like a fundamental piece of a
collaborative editing environment for text.

Regards,
Tb.

I fully appreciate the requirement for change bars and redlining
set forth by T Bruce, and I agree that this is certainly needed
and imporant.  But I must respectfully disagree with his specific
proposal for how to meet this need.  He suggested adding a new form
of emphasis <em strikeout>.  

In my opinion, the example Bruce provides is as good an example of
the value of semantic tagging as one could hope for.  With a semantic
tag, one document could contain both the old and the new versions
of edited passages (or you could have tagged links to the old, whatever).
From this one source, your rendered could generate either:
  1) a listing of just what's currently true
  2) a comparative listing showing just what's changed
  3) a listing of the changes, in context.

Procedural markup like <em strikeout> would not allow this.  Semantic
markup will.  I regret that I don't have a specific proposal of my own
as to how to do this markup.

best wishes

Tom & company:

Before we go much further in defining change bars as an HTML idiom,
let's consider making it a meta issue, i.e., literally the differences
between two different versions of a document.  Otherwise, documents
will start getting real messy!  We've talked about doing some real
version control, let's get to it.

Here's an idea that I think would help browsers derive change "bars":
we define an HTML Diff format that concisely describes the deltas
between two HTML sources.  Before getting into what such a format could
be, here are some other users apart from change bars:

 o a server can use HTML-Diffs to efficiently manage multiple versions
   of a document, both in space and network bandwidth, as in a good
   revision control system;

 o an HTML-Diff format can encode arbitrary annotations -- the current
   style of appending links would be a special case;

 o HTML-Diffs could encode the modifications a user makes to a document
   when "filling in a form", e.g., as modifications to the value
   parameter of certain HTML+ INPUT tags.

Here are my ideas on the format.  We could use something like UNIX diff(1)
format, except that it is very whitespace sensitive and we could end up
with two documents that render identically but have a large number of
UNIX-style diffs.  Seems to me that HTML-Diff should be specific to
SGML, so features like tag-parameter-order-independence are factored
out of diffs.  So we need a notion of a canonical SGML/HTML representation.

I don't know the data structures very well, but libWWW's Structured
Streams could be a good place to start for such a canonical representation.
Presumably SS's are series' of text blocks and tag structures, and the
Diff operations can be standards text editing operations on text blocks
and structure edits on tags.

One tricky issue is how to refer to objects in a SS; I suppose we could
refer to tag ids when possible but otherwise by ordinal position in the
SS.  This would make use of the format somewhat brittle (tricky hand
creation of Diffs!), and would work best when transparent to all users.

Finally, I'll suggest making the format valid SGML.  Maybe that's
controversial, but it seems to me to be a net win.

So in summary, some HTML-Diffs might look like this (off the top of
my head):

<!-- substitute "bar" for "foo" in the fifth structured stream object
     (a text object) >
<DELTA edit ssobj=5 type=text operation="s/foo/bar/">

<!-- add a new anchor to the end of the document >
<DELTA insert location=end data="<a href="http://eitech.com/>EIT</a>">

<!-- an entry into a form as a INPUT tag parameter change>
<DELTA edit idref=blank1 type=tag parameter=value data="Jay Weber">

Perhaps some committee has done this sort of thing for SGML?

I would like to suggest using the HTML+ EM tag:

    a)  two new logical roles:  "deletion", "addition"

    b)  a new rendering hint: strikeout

e.g. <em role=deletion strikeout>old text</em> and then a bit later
     some <em role=addition> new text</em>.

   Another problem with this is - what about the browsers/browser
writers that don't use the libWWW?  Why not use a context-style diff
but ignore differences in white-space?  Strip out spaces and tabs
(except in PRE and XMP, etc), and go from there?  (Should also remove

If you want to encode the things that a browser would probably like to
render using change bars in a TEI conformant way, one simple method
would be to use the tags for editorial changes to mark the things
and specify (with REND) what you want done by the browser.

For example:

.... blah blah <add resp=V1.1 rend=sidebar> Not. </add> blah blah

or similarly

.... blah blah <del resp=V1.1 rend=sidebar> Not. </del> blah blah

This may look like a slightly strange use for these tags, which were
designed for use when transcribing from manuscripts, but I think
legitimate. Problems arise if the thing you want to add or delete spans
other elements. The following, for example, is ILLEGAL

<p> this para starts out well but
   <del resp=V1.2> from here on into the next
<p> paragraph is a load of nonsense which is why it's been
    deleted and </del> ends suddenly.

The easiest (of several) methods suggested by the TEI for dealing with
this is to use the <addspan> element thusly:

<p> this para starts out well but
   <delspan resp=V1.2 to=XY123> from here on into the next
<p> paragraph is a load of nonsense which is why it's been
    deleted and <anchor id=XY123> ends suddenly.

Note the use of the TEI <anchor> element -- no relation to anything
HTMLers know under a similar name -- to mark a point in the document,
solely so that it can have an identifier attached to it, so that some
other element (the <delspan>) can point to it.

The problem is that doing version control right is much harder than
putting in SIMPLE change bars so that you can say "hey Bob, check out
the new stuff in http:... and let me know if you see a problem".

Change bars are important for Engineering, paper writing, and
many other domains as well. This of course raises the larger issue of
whether the web will evolve towards a medium for collaborative work,
with stronger emphasis on authoring tools.

<!--
On Changebars:

Jay Weber's idea of storing diffs outside the changed document
is interesting, but I think we want to be able to represent
versions within a document, too.

Dave Raggett proposes two new ROLE attribute values for 
the HTML+ EM tag, "deletion" and "addition," with a new
rendering hint, strikeout.  Aside from overloading
EM more, a point of some concern already, and aside from
the question of whether EM's role attribute ought to have
a delimited list of values, this won't work when revisions
cross tag boundaries.  A better mechanism is already in 
HTML+, namely CHANGED.  More on that below.

Lou Burnard brings to our attention TEI's (common?)
attribute REND, and suggests ADD and DEL tags with 
REND and RESP attributes, the latter evidently containing
the version number.  Here the tags are empty, and point
to anchors.

I suggest combining these two approaches.  The DTDlet below
uses paired empty elements to help avoid ID and IDREF errors
that could occur with CHANGED (which can have both ID and 
IDREF attributes), with the end element tag pointing to the
beginning element tag, as in CHANGED.  It also includes
an Altered element, which may be unnecessary.  The meanings
of the Version attributes are suggestions at this point.

SGML won't allow you to parse paired empty elements such as
these to see if they both exist, but if the begin element
tag (and its ID) is missing, the IDREF from the end element
tag will fail and an SGML error should be reported.  You 
could also parse nonSGMLlishly to check that every ID from
every begin element tag had a corresponding IDREF.  

These tags may occur anywhere, overlapping anyhow (or 
could when included in the proper content model of a 
parent DTD).  I think this set will accomodate all needs:
does it?  Can anyone think of an easy set of rendering rules
for likely combinations of these elements?  Does it matter
that you could place the end element tag before the begin
element tag in a document?

This document parses through sgmls.  -->

Subject: Re Tables
Status: RO

Omy Ronquillo asks about Tables.  The best you can do now is
mess around with PRE; there is a Table content model in the 
HTML+ DTD, but at the WWW developer's conference (is someone
going to post a review of that event?) no one liked it because
it would take two passes to format it.  It was suggested that
PRE would be good enough ad interim.

The Tex approach was mentioned, and deserves consideration:
Texbook ch 22, "Alignment," covers Tex's various mechanisms,
one of which uses a preamble, sorta like a troff table header.
We could do a crude approximation of a table preamble by
allowing a line that specifies the number and width of columns
with actual spaces and separators, sorta like variable tabbing.
Would such a mechanism make it possible to format tables in
a single pass?

I don't see why it is so important to be able to mark changed sections across tag boundaries with a single pair of tags.  To me it seems to violate the concept of semantic tagging.  If the last half of paragraph 1 and the first half of paragraph 2 are changed then it makes sense to mark it that way.  For example:


<PARA>
Someone changed <EM change>the last half of this paragraph.</EM>
</PARA>
<PARA>
<EM change>The first half of this paragraph</EM>was also changed.
</PARA>

Or maybe it should be <EM ROLE="change">.  In any case, it should be easy for an HTML editor to automatically "do the right thing" and split a user's emphasis command into properly nested tags and end tags as necessary to maintain legal syntax.  Even for hand written HTML there could be a simple parser that fixes improperly nested tags in the "obvious" way.

This approach seems both cleaner and easier to implement than matching id schemes.

Am I being naive?

Subject: RE Chngbars Elements
Status: RO

Steve Putz would rather have changed marked by EM pairs, and would
be willing to split up a change that crossed PARA boundaries 
into two changes.  If you could retain the same ID for the two 
resulting EM start tags, that might be just barely acceptable.
But you can't; it's an error according to SGML.  So you'll
have no way to know that the change that goes to the end of
PARA foo is the same change that begins the next PARA, bar.

So we need to use EMPTY elements instead of elements with
content.

Regards,

Ah, but I claim it is just as reasonable to insist that they are NOT
the same change, since they are in different paragraphs.  Does this
view cause problems?

Does the other (id) scheme allow DISJOINT change sections that are part
of "the same change"?  If so I see that as useful.  Otherwise allowing
a given change to span (only) contiguous tag boundaries doesn't seem
very useful.

Status: RO

A snapshot of the Mosaic documentation, home page, etc. is now
available via anonymous ftp to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/misc:

-rw-r--r--  1 marca       30313 Aug  6 19:59 html-primer-080693.html
-rw-r--r--  1 marca      748153 Aug  6 19:57 mosaic-docs-080693.tar.Z

-rw-r--r--  1 marca        5196 Aug  6 19:59 url-primer-080693.html

With these files and the configuration options in Mosaic 2.0
prerelease 1 (and later), you should be able to set up a purely local
installation of Mosaic.

NOTE THAT THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF THE DOCUMENTS AS THEY EXIST ON
www.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Hyperlinks to external network resources (or even
to other documents on www.ncsa.uiuc.edu) have not been pruned.
However, everything is usable nevertheless.

These files will be updated from time to time as changes warrant.

Cheers,
Marc

Hello everyone,

   Anyone out there going to take the time to summarize what went on
at the W^5?  Due to some last minute problems I wasn't able to make it
to the conference.

   I take it <TBL> is going to be changed (just when I got it working
halfway decently too! Hmph) Any other changes?  I'm especially
interested in any discussions that went on over Marc V.'s
authorization/security concerns.

   Would be great if someone would stick this on their WWW server.  :)
Hint hint.  I can probably find room for it here I am sure if nobody
else wants to serve it.

    Thanks,
      Bill Perry

Hello all,

    W3 is a hypertext (specifically World Wide Web) browser for
emacs.  I wrote it because I am an emacs-dweeb and had nothing better
to do during a graveyard shift one night.  I've kept going at it
because I don't know when to quit, and people seem to like it. :)

    The browser supports all HTML elements, and every url type except
wais - which will be coming soon, as soon as I figure out how wais.el
works.  If you are using Lucid Emacs, Epoch, or Emacs19, W3 will
support multiple fonts, highlighting, etc.  If you are using a version
of Epoch that was compiled with the add-graphic-zone extensions, you
will be able to view inlinded images within the emacs buffer
(currently supports 11 types of embedded graphics, but you must have
the pbmplus package to use this)

    This is to announce version 0.935 Beta of this browser.  I was
waiting to release version 1.0 (nonbeta) until I got more HTML+
support put in, but I am going to be swamped with final projects soon,
and wanted I don't seem to have broken anything while fixing the other
stuff. :)

    Major Features:
    	1. Full access to HTTP, FTP (via ange-ftp), news, local files,
    	   gopher (via gopher.el), telnet, mail, and local files.
    	2. Support for HTTP/1.0 (basic - only supports the GET method,
    	   but then again, no servers support anything else but that
    	   yet either :)
    	3. As much compatiblity with Xmosaic as I could think of
        	a. Group annotation server support, adding & deleting
    	    	b. Personal annotation support, adding & deleting,
        	   although I need to work a few bugs out
    	    	c. Hotlists, using, adding & deleting
    	    	d. A history mechanism, and a function to write it out
    		   to the .mosaic-global-history file in the correct
        	   format.  (Also an easy way to view the history in a
        	   hypertext manner)
    	4. Support for passing files to external viewers, or emacs
    	   lisp functions.  (ie: files ending in .gif can be sent to
    	   "xv", files ending in .el can be sent to 'emacs-lisp-mode.
    	   (Format is like for auto-mode-alist - regular expressions,
    	   etc))
    	5. Support for MIME types when talking to an HTTP/1.0 server
    	   You can specify 'viewers' by MIME content-types. ie:
    	   image/gif can be passed to xv.
    	6. Basic Hyperbole support (thanks to jsc@monolith.mit.edu)
    	7. The ability to 'preview' an emacs buffer as an html
    	   document.
    	8. Infinitely nestable lists (finally :)
    	9. more more more more :)

    This package can be obtained via ftp from cs.indiana.edu in
/pub/elisp/w3.  The file extras.tar.z contains auxiliar files I use in
w3 (ange-ftp, nntp, background, gopher, forms, wais, and html-mode).
The file w3.tar.z contains all my lisp code, LaTeX documentation, and
a makefile to simplify installation and modifying your .emacs file for
the lisp-squeamish.

    The LaTeX documentation has been transformed into HTML by the
great latex2html translator by Nikos Drakos.

Thats:

<A HREF="http://cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">For documentation</A>

    
    If you pick up this package, please send me some mail letting me
know.  I'll put you on a mailing list for beta versions/bug fixes if
you wish.

    If you discover any bugs, please let me know (fixes welcome, but
not necessary)

    Thanks,
    	Bill Perry (wmperry@indiana.edu)

X-Md4-Signature: 4e26b0872129d2d96c5becc1348013fa
Status: RO

Hi folks,

I meant to get prerelease 2 out yesterday to satisfy the many requests
for various things (see list below), but I'm being stalled by a nasty
little bug in RS/6000 Motif, so it will probably be a few days before
it makes it out the door.

Sorry for the delay,
Marc

 o Added searchIndexInDialog resource.  If false (default), Search Index
   field (from 1.2) pops up on searchable pages and pops down on
   non-searchable pages.  If true, Search Index button (from 2.0 prerelease
   0/1) allows user to call up dialog box.  
 o The "Reload" option now clears out cached image data for the current
   document before reloading the document, thus causing the images to be
   reloaded also, if resource reloadReloadsImages is set to true (default is
   false).  
 o The "Clear Image Cache" menu option wipes out all cached images
   (reclaiming memory).  
 o "Clear Global History" also clears the image cache now.  
 o Fixed bug with internal bitmaps used in Gopher menus failing on
   non-8-bit displays.  
 o Ripped out Window Per Document option (middle button still causes
   new window to be opened on anchor activation).  
 o Toplevel Makefile (configure one file, type 'make', and you're done), as
   well as Makefile.sun, Makefile.ibm, Makefile.dec, Makefile.alpha for
   common configurations.  
 o Configurable Documents menu.  By default there isn't one.  Places to
   look in order of preference at program startup are the value of the
   resource documentsMenuSpecfile (by default
   /usr/local/mosaic/documents.menu), the value of the environment
   variable MOSAIC_DOCUMENTS_MENU_SPECFILE, and the value
   of the compile-time #define DOCUMENTS_MENU_SPECFILE (by
   default /usr/local/mosaic/documents.menu).  

   The specfile itself consists of alternating lines of title and URL; a single
   line starting with two dashes ("--") between any two title/URL pairs
   counts as a separator.  By default up to 80 things (title/URL pairs +
   separators) can be in a specfile; this can be increased in
   src/gui-menubar.c if you're crazy.  An example specfile is distributed
   with the source code (but is not intended to be a default).  

   The developer who implemented this feature disagrees with its presence
   in the program; the contents of such a customizable menubar ought to be
   in a hypermedia page (so you can actually format, lay out, and explain
   the various hyperlinks) that in turn ought to be served to the network (so
   others can benefit from your organization of information).  
 o Added simpleInterface resource to allow menubar and bottom button
   configuration to be considerably pared down (default is false).
   Comments on what should and shouldn't be in the simple user interface
   should be sent to cbushell@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  
 o Added "Network Starting Points" document pointer in Navigate menu
   (to make up for disappearance of Documents & Manuals menu); the
   URL is customizable at compile time (see src/mosaic.h).  
 o Fixed yet another libwww bug -- coredump on malformed URL 
   gopher//mother.cs.bham.ac.uk:2070/.

quick question because I don't know details of inetd:

If I were to write a shell script that would read from a file, and write
an updated file back to the filesystem (and ofcourse send some
html output too), will I get in trouble when more than one www users
accesses this script at almost the same time...
or more precisly, will the access from the first user completly be finished
before inetd alows the second user acces, or will inetd start two simultanions
running shell script.

that's the question, so.. what is the answer??

- thanks,

I could not agree more. This is also my reason for insisting on URLs  
that tell you what you can expect.
I prefer the URL

Subject: Annotations futures
Status: RO

Might I suggest the following system for public annotations?

-- User annotates document, client offers it to original server with
	ANNOTATE method or somesuch, and tells the server how long
	the annotation is
-- Server can accept the annotation, and the next time the document
	is retrieved, the annotation is noted at the bottom.
-- Server can refuse the annotation, in which case, it is
	offered to an annotation server (ugh).

Annotating on the server would mean that character-offsets could be
used and preserved across revisions (the author would either
incorporate, delete or move the annotations as need be).

Sound fun?  Who's going to implement it?

I haven't been following this discussion at all, but using character-offsets
seems like a pretty weak mechanism for marking annotation positions when
you have the SGML structure of a document lying around.  Saving the
structure information with the annotation will give you a much better chance
of recovery when a document is revised.  Our experience on Oracle Book, a
commercial hypertext system, is that except for electronic review situations,
authors will not take responsibility for repositioning annotations.
We currently use only character-offsets, but are moving towards storage of
SGML structure in future versions.

Fair enough.  Instead of character-position offsets, do you mean
	fourth H1
	third H2
	second para

Is that enough detail for the annotation?

This sounds reasonable.  I think this means the annotations (as
stored) should have an md-5 digital signature of the original document
to enable the client to say ``this is an annotation of an EARLIER
version''.  I don't think full versioning is possible, given the
limitations of the resolution of HTML's semantics.

There is an element in HTMLplus, NOTE, that serves to position
annotations.  It could be twiddled a little to separate ID
and IDREF into two separate tags (as I suggested for changebars),
and Steve Putz will object to it because it's nonhierarchical
just like changebars (but these are inherently nonhierarchical
document views, Steve), but it ought to be included in discussion
of how to position annotations.

The more structural information you have the better.  Ideally you have unique
IDs with each of the structural elements, so that you can say:

fourth H1 id=3
third H2  id=7
second para id=12

 ... my annotation ...

third para id = 13
second H2 id=8
first para id = 14

or something like that, and you store both the structure before and after
the annotation.  Then you have a chance of recovering as long as future
revisions of the document don't alter the original IDs.

A couple of comments.  It seems like documents can have at least a couple of
purposes.  First, they can be traditional things where someone writes them,
a few people comment, and the author integrates or rejects their suggestions.

The second is a document as the source for a thread, similar to the way netnews
or Lotus Notes work.  In this case, it is likely that there will be one
original document and many annotations.  In this case, the author shouldn't
revise the original document, subthreads which pertain to other annotations
rather than the original document should be allowed, and you need a fairly
serious bulletin-board style UI as opposed to the simple document interface.
In a number of cases I can think of, this latter model would be very useful
with WWW.

X-Md4-Signature: aa61cfa6d87d029650bacbd8e91dd1b5
Status: RO

......ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/prerelease.  Source, plus binaries
for Sun, IBM, SGI.

This prerelease fixes problems with prerelease 1 and provides some new
(experimental) functionality.  Changes include:

 o Added searchIndexInDialog resource.  If false (default), Search Index
   field (from 1.2) pops up on searchable pages and pops down on
   non-searchable pages.  If true, Search Index button (from 2.0
   prerelease 0/1) allows user to call up dialog box.  
 o The "Reload" option now clears out cached image data for the current
   document before reloading the document, thus causing the images to
   be reloaded also, if resource reloadReloadsImages is set to true
   (default is false).  
 o The "Clear Image Cache" menu option wipes out all cached images
   (reclaiming memory).  
 o "Clear Global History" also clears the image cache now.  
 o Fixed bug with internal bitmaps used in Gopher menus failing on
   non-8-bit displays.  
 o Ripped out Window Per Document option (middle button still causes
   new window to be opened on anchor activation).  
 o Toplevel Makefile (configure one file, type 'make', and you're done),
   as well as Makefile.sun, Makefile.ibm, Makefile.dec, Makefile.alpha
   for common configurations.  
 o Configurable Documents menu.  By default there isn't one.  Places to
   look in order of preference at program startup are the value of the
   resource documentsMenuSpecfile (by default
   /usr/local/mosaic/documents.menu), the value of the environment
   variable MOSAIC_DOCUMENTS_MENU_SPECFILE, and the
   value of the compile-time #define
   DOCUMENTS_MENU_SPECFILE (by default
   /usr/local/mosaic/documents.menu).  

   The specfile itself consists of alternating lines of title and URL; a
   single line starting with two dashes ("--") between any two title/URL
   pairs counts as a separator.  By default up to 80 things (title/URL pairs
   + separators) can be in a specfile; this can be increased in
   src/gui-menubar.c if you're crazy.  An example specfile is distributed
   with the source code (but is not intended to be a default).  

   The developer who implemented this feature disagrees with its
   presence in the program; the contents of such a customizable menubar
   ought to be in a hypermedia page (so you can actually format, lay out,
   and explain the various hyperlinks) that in turn ought to be served to
   the network (so others can benefit from your organization of
   information).  
 o Added simpleInterface resource to allow menubar and bottom button
   configuration to be considerably pared down (default is false).
   Comments on what should and shouldn't be in the simple user
   interface should be sent to cbushell@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  
 o Added "Network Starting Points" document pointer in Navigate menu
   (to make up for disappearance of Documents & Manuals menu); the
   URL is customizable at compile time (see src/mosaic.h).  
 o trackPointerMotion can now be set to false to inhibit pointer/URL
   tracking.  
 o Fixed yet another libwww bug -- coredump on malformed URL 
   gopher//mother.cs.bham.ac.uk:2070/.  

Comments and feedback appreciated -- THIS IS UNSUPPORTED CODE,
however; if you want stability, get Mosaic 1.2
(/Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries and /Mosaic/xmosaic-source).  In particular,
the next few prereleases will be dramatically different as they will
involve new HTML widget functionality and libwww2 integration.

Cheers,
Marc

Poor marc.  Here we go again --- the great Documents menu decision.
Would it be better to have a button like ``Home'' called ``Documents''
that jumps to a configurable URL (which can also be a file:// as a
configurable thing).  This would remove the designer's objection that
it ought to be a network-accessable page, as well as the need for a
standard set of useful pointers.

Well?

The major objection that I (and colleagues here) had to the original
Documents/Manuals menu was not that we REALLY wanted configurable menus
per se, but that, if there were GOING to be menus, we need to configure
them. I totally agree that menus are a Bad Thing; my main objection is
that different browsers will not see the same list of documents; we
should present our users with a consistent view of WWW, and it doesn't
help them to have docs which are only easily accessible from one browser.

I would be happy to see NO "warp to this URL" menu options or buttons
other than Home on all browsers. Possibly a help button, but even so,
let the local system manager decide on whether to have it there, which
URL it points to etc. If the local system manager wants NO links
outside actual documents, respect that, and allow her to turn all such
options OFF. It's even worse that the menu was so US centered. The
US-UK link is still an expensive resource, and I don't want my users
reading man pages in Ohio or Indiana when the definitive man pages are
here at Cranfield.

So, Nat, if you want a "Documents" button pointing to a configurable
URL, fine, but I really don't want it! Marc, allow me not to have it.

This is the kind of reference scheme I asked for in my note on HTML
Diffs (a generalization of annotations).  Looks like overkill, though;
is it worth numbering by type -- "fourth H1" as opposed to "fourth
object" -- since it is probably better to avoid applying diffs to
incorrect versions via the hash checks Nat mentioned?

"Objects" in SGML sources are easy to define, just divide the source
into tag instances and the text among them, and number sequentially.
Then we'll want a way of referencing tag substructure, say "the value
of the HREF parameter of the 10th object".

You're right, ideally we'd have both mechanisms and ways of moving
between them.  I'd been thinking of diff-mergining as a browser task,
but if we have an intrinsic diff representation then it can be a
server task as well (or instead).  That is, the URL

  http://eitech.com/mydoc.html,1

could fetch an original document,

  http://eitech.com/mydoc.html,2

could fetch the next version (version 1 plus some diffs transparently
merged by the server), and

  http://eitech.com/mydoc.html,1,2

could fetch the next version with the diffs merged in a way that
identifies them.

As our USENET news software now seems fairly stable, I subscribed to

Is the idea to gateway www-talk and c.i.w? I know this was discussed
some time ago, but I don't remember what the decision was (or if there was one).

Well, everyone wants something different.

What we want to be able to do is have information in the HTML header
that indicates the structural aspects of an HTML document relative to
some larger whole, e.g. pages w/in an article, w/in an issue, w/in a
volume w/in a journal.

We would then structure the documents (or whatever) menu to reflect the
structural components of the HTML document.  In general there might be a
next, previous, and up document, but there might also be article, table
of contents, volumes, and library links as well.

We are going to be looking at XMosaic to determine how this type of
support might be implemented and if there is going to be some mechanism
to define the ''Documents'' menu at run-time, we might very well make
use of it.

What you describe is different, right enough - it's not at all the
series of URLs which can be warped to directly from the Document/Manual
menu that I (and I think most others) have been discussing.

What you describe appears to me to be a meta-document - i.e. it
describes the main document, and this kind of thing can be created
easily in HTML. If I want it to look really spiffy, I can have inlined
icons of arrows, volumes, etc. I need only process the document once,
all users get the same view of the doc (given the limitations of their
viewer), and you don't have to hassle Marc A and the team to produce
run-time hackable menus (or do it yourself). Whether you prepend the
meta-doc to the real doc or not matter of taste.

No, not true.

I already have those links "hacked" into my documents, but they are not
part of my document and I don't want them to be printed, or saved, or
anything, other than be indicators that a client application could use
to provide navigational references.

Also, it is not a meta-document, it is a document.  You can abstract the
notion of a document to be anything from an individual segment of HTML
to the entire Library of Congress and the system needs to support that
abstraction.

I am not going to hassle Marc or anyone at NCSA for this functionality;
I only offer our application of the technology as an example of the
types of hoops which people are going to put HTML/HTTP clients thru.

What you want are <LINK>'s which are defined in HTML but no one implements
them so I guess no one really wants to use them very badly :-)

See Also
    <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/LINK.html>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Typical uses are to indicate authorship, related indexes and glossaries,
    older or more recent versions, etc.  Links can indicate a static tree
    structure in which the document was authored by pointing to a "parent"
    and "next" and "previous" document, for example.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Relationships.html>

    The defined relationship values are:
	UseIndex UseGlossary Annotation Reply Embed Precedes
	Subdocument Present Search Supersedes History
	Includes Made Interested

For example you can do this:

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Chapter 2: Item 2</TITLE>
<LINK REL="Made" HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/hyplan/sanders.html">
<LINK REL="Precedes" HREF="/ch2/item3.html">
<LINK REV="Precedes" HREF="/ch2/item1.html">
<LINK REV="Subdocument" HREF="/ch2/index.html">
</HEAD>

With some minor hacks to an HTTP server (like Plexus) you could generate
these relationships on the fly.  An even clever server could use annotations
on the Made document (http://www.bsdi.com/hyplan/sanders.html) to generate
email to the person described (look ma, no mailto: URL; which IMHO a major
kludge anyway).

Something I want is <LINK REL="Navigation" HREF=".../nav-style.html">
which the browser renders in a special Nav section of it's user interface,
possibly in a popup, (yes this means you build the Nav UI on the fly for
each document but you could use caching).  Of course, the browser
could/would still provide it's standard Nav functions as well (or it might
provide a toggle between them or whatever).  This would let us do rapid
prototyping of different Navigation styles so we can figure out what works
best for different kinds of document spaces.

We want them very badly.  Do we have a chicken and egg
problem here?  LINKs aren't implemented in browsers because
they don't appear in the files, and they don't appear in
the files because they aren't implemented? How do we get
them?

We plan to put a lot of structured documentation online.
For reasons of performance and usability, we need to chunk
it out into topics along heading boundaries.  Currently I
have to generate HREFs at the end of each topic to indicate
how it fits into the structure (next, previous, children,
parent).  That is clunky but usable for navigation, but it
doesn't help for printing when someone wants to print out a
whole chapter by starting at a point in the hierarchy.  If
a browser could follow the LINKs downward and in sequence,
a user could specify to print a whole chapter.  It appears
that this is exactly what the LINK mechanism was designed
to do, but it doesn't seem to be supported.

Looks like I'm going to be the first to put my foot in my mouth and offend
a bunch of people by posting my WWWWW notes.  Hopefully, these will give
people who weren't there and idea about what went on, spur those who took
better notes to publish, and refresh some attendees memories about what
we did (esp those of you who took off Thursday night to the bar :-).

These are available online at:
    <http://www.bsdi.com/HTTP:TNG/WWWWW-notes.etx>
I'll be making corrections to the online version as time passes.

Notes from WWWWW
================

July 28, 29, 30
---------------

  The overall workshop was very positive.  There was clearly a lot of stuff
  that can be done to enhance the functionality of the Web.  In fact,
  there was so much to talk about we couldn't even begin to cover it all
  (the official note takers should have a complete list).  The overall
  consensus was to stick to talking about problems we could solve during
  the three days of the workshop, this task alone was probably too big
  a scope for three days.

  There were several "tracks" of discussion going on simultaneously so
  my notes only cover topics I attended.  These are not complete notes
  but I wanted to post this to give everyone an idea about what went on
  until the official note takers have time to compile their notes (which
  are no doubt more extensive and correct than mine).

  The ultimate goal was to define HTML and HTTP/1.0 at a fine enough
  level that we could issue RFC's and have a stable base to build on.

  Other goals were to study the HTML+ proposed RFC and define what could
  be done and what could not (it was agreed that we should define
  implementation levels and outline what features must be supported at
  each level).  I cleverly avoid much of this discussion as it was
  probably the most frustrating part of the workshop (so many features,
  so little time).

  Also, Tim Berners-Lee used a few well spent moments on his soap-box
  about how to do things like ISMAP and ISINDEX correctly (which I will
  cover in these notes).  We also talked about how to define Style Guides
  so authors could provide hints to browsers about how to render their
  documents best.  A new annotation protocol was also designed.

  Finally, we discussed the eventuality of having a Consortium take over
  certain management functions and overseeing WWW development.


Accomplishments
---------------

    * A base Level 0 HTML and HTTP/1.0 was defined
    * Consortium goals/responsibilities were outlined
    * New Annotation Protocol defined
    * Some consensus about Style Guides was reached
    * Lots of bugs worked about HTML+
    * How to do client profile was defined (a mini-proposal is included)
    * Scanned images of all attendees (except marca) online :-)


Remaining Issues
----------------

  These are the issues still unresolved in this document (some because
  they aren't resolved and some because I don't understand what was
  really agreed upon due to poor notes).

    * Accept-Encoding:, It's not clear to me that this is the best
      solution.  See MIME Proposal_
    * How Boundary for PUT and POST are going to be implemented.
    * Exact syntax for WWW-Link and mappings from all the things
      in <HEAD>...</HEAD> to HTTP/1.0 headers.  Also, it's not clear
      which takes precedence in case of conflict.  I think TimBL
      will address these issues in the official spec.
    * The <LINK REL="Style" HREF="..."> for style guides (in my print-out
      it has <LINK STYLE="...">).

  Probably others.  Please open discussions on www-talk@info.cern.ch.


Details
-------

First, there seemed to be a lot of confusion over the names of various things.

    * HTTP/0.9, this is the protocol that only implements GET.
    * HTTP/1.0 is also known as HTTP2.  This is the HTTP spec that defines
      RFC822/MIME headers for HTTP objects.
    * HTML is the simple, existing HTML spec
    * HTML+ is the new and under development extended spec.

Also, I would like to point out that when I say something like
"it was agreed", this means I agreed and that I thought everyone
else agreed also.  Feel free to post corrections.


Defined Implementation Levels -- HTML: Level 0
----------------------------------------------

It was decided to add the following items to the HTML spec before it
goes out for RFC.  Browser writers should be implementing these features
RSN.  This is not the definitive list, I don't know who owns the problem
for sure.  Whoever is going to own this should speak up so people doing
implementations can ask questions.

<BR>
    I forget what this was supposed to be, I think it means force a line
    break.

<HR>
    Horizontal rule, replaces use of ---------------------

&nbsp
    Other entities will added also, wait for the spec for details
    nbsp means non-breakable white space

allow nested lists (DL NL DL)
    ala NCSA Mosaic

<IMG ALT="text to display if you can't display the image" SRC="" ISMAP>
    (ISMAP is depreciate, see below about "Accepted: SPACEJUMP")

Allow <DT>'s without <DD>'s
    e.g., <DL><DT>one<DT>two<DT>three</DL>

White Space is to be folded
    This means "foo  bar" should render the same as "foo bar".

<OPINION>
Browsers should also implement at least "Made", "Precedes", "UseIndex",
"Annotation", "Subdocument", "Supersedes", "History" REL and REV
values for use in <LINK>.  Support for <BASE> would be real nice also.
</OPINION>


ISMAP
-----

  ISMAP is being depreciated (though it's still the only way to make this
  work for HTTP/0.9) in favor of using "Accepted: SPACEJUMP" in the HTTP/1.0
  headers.  Tim Berners-Lee suggested this in one of his soap-box talks.
  Several arguments ensued (though I was already converted) but it was
  finally agreed that the attributes of an object should not be specified
  in the link to that object if at all possible.

  Also, a new HTTP/1.0 header WWW-Link: was proposed to allow Index search
  redirection in the Object header.  For example, to specify an index
  redirect for an image that is searchable:

  HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
  Date: Tuesday, 10-Aug-93 19:33:11 GMT
  Server: plexus/2.2.1
  WWW-Link: REL="UseIndex" HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/image-decoder/"
  Public: SPACEJUMP, GET
  Allowed: SPACEJUMP, GET
  MIME-version: 1.0
  Last-modified: Saturday, 07-Aug-93 21:14:42 GMT
  Content-type: image/gif

  Tim will hopefully make this clearer in the HTTP spec.


Defined Implementation Levels -- HTTP/1.0: Level 0
--------------------------------------------------

  Browsers/servers should support at least the following HTTP/1.0 object
  headers:

    Accept:
    Accept-Encoding:		** See MIME Proposal_
    User-Agent:
    Allowed: [SPACEJUMP, GET, PUT, TEXTSEARCH, ...]
    Public: [SPACEJUMP, GET, PUT, TEXTSEARCH, ...]
    WWW-Link: REL="..." HREF="..."
    Content-Type:

  Where possible support:

    From: [email address]

  Most of this should eventually be handled by libwww.


Consortium
----------

  The basic idea was that TimBL and CERN can't own the problem of
  developing hypertext for the rest of the world so he proposed
  setting up a Consortium to own the problem.  Here are some of the
  items that were discussed.

    Issues:

    * What do you get for being a member?
      o Representation
      o Training
      o Workshops/Conferences
    * How do vendors contribute?
      o Funding (money)
      o Provide Technical Expertise (time)

    What the Consortium might do:

    * Manage funds (this was a point of argument)
    * Publicity/PR for the Web
    * Run conferences
    * Sets future development directions
    * Coordinates information exchange (I want to know about XYX, who's
      working on stuff like this)
    * Provides a Stamp of Approval
      o Reference Implementation
      o Guidelines
      o Testing (ugh)
      o Defines Implementation Levels
    * Isolate funding from the design process


Proposed Annotation Protocol
----------------------------

  It was decided that annotations could be implemented using the existing
  defined HTTP/1.0 methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE).  The only thing that
  really needed to be worked out was how PUT and POST should work.

  The spec will be changed to reflect the following (again, until
  the spec is updated this information is FYI only).

  PUT and POST will support using Length: and MIME boundary's.

  I don't understand how we are going to implement boundary's for sure.
  I propose we stick with MIME and make it part of the content-type, e.g.:

    Content-Type: www/annotation; boundary="string"

    TEXT ... TEXT
    --string--

  Any comments?

Style Guides (Rendering Guides?)
--------------------------------

  Rob Raisch had a proposal for Style Guides.  The basic idea is
  to define a format for specifying rendering hints to the browser
  external to the document (so you can easily swap them around).

  Issues discussed included details of cacheing the style guide.

  Sorry, I don't have a pointer to the proposal.  Perhaps someone
  can post one that knows where it is.

  I think everyone pretty much agreed that this would be a good thing
  to do and that in reality it wasn't going to be to hard to implement.

  <LINK REL="Style" HREF="..."> was proposed to point to the style guide.

  I think code to deal with style guides is supposed to end up in libwww
  at some point.

  This feature can be introduced at anything without breaking anything
  so it was not part of the Level 0 Implementation Goals.


Client Profiles
---------------

  The idea of the client profile is to allow the server to send back
  data in the most appropriate format.  This is part of format
  negotiation.  The general idea is to send more hints along with the
  request in the Accept: field.  For example:

    Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
            width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85

  This tells the server that you have a color display with 256 unique colors
  and it's 1024x768 at 85dpi (aspect ratio is 1:1).  The problem this
  solves is rendering 24 bit images on mono displays is pretty ugly
  so it would be nice if the server happens to have the image data
  in mono then it could just send it.

  I have a proposal for HTTP defined MIME types and associated client
  profile information online_ at:
    <http://www.bsdi.com/HTTP:TNG/MIME-ClientProfile.html>

HTML+
-----

  Oh boy, what I can say about this.  I'll just say that lots of
  changes were proposed and you will have to wait for details from
  the official note takers.  To be fair, most of the changes are
  really needed and a lot of work was done to make the spec most
  consistent.

  I think the only way to resolve some of the problems (short of
  endless arguments) is to do a prototype implementation to play
  around with.


Misc Issues
===========

Authoring Tools
---------------

  The general impression I got was that doing Authoring Tools right
  was going to be difficult in practice and nobody jumped on the
  opportunity to write one.  It's a massive User Interface nightmare.
  Given that there isn't a consensus on the perfect text based editor
  I feel sorry for the poor guy that first publishes one of these :-)

  I think we all agreed that authoring tools are needed, it was just
  that nobody wanted to do it.  Oh well.


libwww2 ownership
-----------------

  TimBL wanted to setup something so that people that want to do
  development on libwww2 could have access to something like a CVS
  tree over the net.  I signed up to add support for PUT to Plexus
  and back-end it with CVS.  Should be trivial as soon as I get
  some free time.


Z39.50
------

  There was a discussion about the overlap of Z39.50 and HTTP/1.0.
  I got the impression that we wanted to keep HTTP/1.0 but that it should
  be possible (some claimed trivial) for browsers to support Z39.50 as
  well for talking to Z39.50 servers.

  The best argument for HTTP is the 0.9 protocol can be trivially implemented,
  even using simple shell scripts.

  It was claimed that Z39.50 was trivial also, but attempts to write down
  a request on the white board failed (though we did get a better
  understanding of the protocol).

  It does seem pretty clear that the two protocols are getting closer
  in functionality.

  Arguments for Z39.50 is it already has billing and authentication
  support (though it wasn't clear to me that there were really any
  working Z39.50 implementations that did this).  At any rate, HTTP
  should be able to use nearly identical authentication protocols if
  anyone cares to implement them.

Would anyone get terribly upset if I made the optional non-prefixed
argument to 'xmosaic' that now specifies the home page simply specify
the starting page instead?

So, e.g., doing:

        xmosaic -home foo.html bar.html

...would result in the initial document being 'bar.html' but when you
hit "Home" you'd go to 'foo.html'.

Reply straight to me only if you have a serious objection...

Yes!  Will this also get rid of the annoying libwww whitespace
irregularities around <DL>s?  (see

an example)

What kind(s) of authoring tools are we looking for?  Could an idealist

Because they haven't been on the top of any volunteer developer's
priority list yet, and because nobody's yet offered to pay a volunteer
developer to raise the priority on them (or, even for the most part,
suggested that it's more important than a hundred and one other
things)...

We're gonna support them sometime in 2.0, I hope -- I think the
capabilities are quite important.

Nat suggests more newsgroups, including

	comp.infosystems.www.futures
	comp.infosystems.www.browsers
	comp.infosystems.www.servers
	comp.infosystems.www.develop
	comp.infosystems.www.misc

If the idea is entertained seriously, add one more,

	comp.infosystems.www.authors

So we can discuss issues of style, authoring tools, and the web's  
content (what's good, what's new, what's coming).

Authors won't bother to use them until browsers support them, and
browser developers won't regard it as high priority until authors use
them in real docs. Once the vicious circle is broken by those nice
people at NCSA, I guess they'll become widespread.

Status: RO

It seems to me that the LINKs that people are currently talking about
are an artifice which HTML has to bolt on as a direct consequence of not
providing proper document structuring capabilities. (hastily dons
asbestos overalls)

In a *real* SGML world, your document structure would be exactly
mirrored by the SGML structure. In HTML-ese, your H1 elements would nest
directly within the document, H2 elements within H1s and so on down. To
construct a top level outliner-style index you just need to pick up the
heading of the H1s, to expand one of them just look at the headings of
its children H2s, and so on. Take a look at the way DynaText functions,
for example.

To move around the document in terms of the hierarchy you just need to
maintain a tree within the browser. You must have a 'parent', 'child', 
'left' and 'right' functions. To my mind it's bizarre to hard code
pointers or links for such functions into the document: they're part of the
semantics of having an SGML document in the first place. Furthermore, if
each element in an HTML document potentially had a unique identifier
then each element could be linked to independently of the rigid document
hierarchy that outliners like. That way you'd get the best of both
worlds.

This seems so obvious I must be missing something.

Lou

This is a *very* low-powered way of looking at an SGML document! An SGML
document is a tree, for heaven's sake. The sequential ordering of
elements (not "the text between the tags") is interesting, but not as
interesting as their hierarchic disposition. You want to be able to say
things like "the third BLORT which is a child of any FARBLE which has
attribute value 'Gung-Ho'" . Well, maybe you don't -- but I do.

 RE: Questions -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol Internet Draft 14-Jul-93
 
I have just read the document and a number of questions have come up concerning
 the actual implementation.
 
 1)  The ProtocolVersion stated in 1. is shown to be HTTP/V1.0 and also in 2.
     however in 1.1 Protocol Version it is stated 'only HTRQ is defined'.
     I assume HTRQ, based on an earlier document, is correct and 
     is the ProtocolVersion is really HTRQ/V1.0?
 
 2)  How does one terminate HTRQ header if there is no data to follow?  I 
     realize that a blank line separates header from data so does one still
     include a blank line if there is only header information?
 
 3)  An earlier document on HTTP describes the TEXTSEARCH method to request a
     search to be done utilizing search information contained in the data
     section.  Since the data section is in MIME this would allow complex 
     searches to be done and searches done on information other than ASCII text.
     The latest document seems to degrade method TEXTSEARCH to only a server
     response to indicate that searching is possible.  One then uses the
     GET method ( ie ?xxx+yyy ... ) to perform the actual search.  This does
     now restrict the search capabilities to only ASCII and simple searches.
     (ie 'very' limited pattern matching and no boolean operators ).  Is it
     now intended to keep TEXTSEARCH only as a response ( ie duplicating
     [ISINDEX] functionality) or to return its functionality as a request 
     method.
 
 4)  What does HTRQ stand for?  My best guess to date is HyperText ReQuest 
 
 5)  The abstract in the document states that 'It is a generic
     stateless object-oriented protocol'.  however it is suggested in 1.7.6
     Referer: that the information send could be used by the server to
     generate lists of back-links to documents.  This functionality would
     not make the server `stateless'.  Is this what is intended?

 6)  The CHECKIN and CHECKOUT methods do not have an associated server
     response.  This would be required so that the server could return a
     `lock indentifier` that would have to be used to unlock the object at
     a later date.  This would then maintain the 'statelessness' of the
     server.  Also how does the client set the lock timeout or is it up to
     the server to assign an arbitrary timeout to the lock?

With Thanks

I would recommend that if the www group is to be changed the
proper division is more like
	comp.infosystems.www
	comp.infosystems.www.programmer
	comp.infosystems.www.announce
where "announce" is moderated news information where people talk
about the latest and greatest stuff they have done on the net,
"programmer" is roughly the current www-talk which discusses
nitty gritty implementation details, and the current group
is as it is now.

For that matter the gopher group has needed an "announce" group
for a while as well, would be useful to pick that off too;
and an announce for the wais group.

Alternatively there oculd be just
	comp.infosystems.announce

My spec for these groups by the way would be to have all articles
posted in a form such that a smart browser could launch you 
directly to the resource in question.  I know that similar
stuff has been done for the pictures gruops (the auto-unpacker
that someone did); has anyone trained a similar scheme on say
"bit.listserv.hytel-l" (the "hytelnet" free telnet sites announce
group) ?

How about just:

comp.infosystems.www            (misc discussions, every not covered below)
comp.infosystems.www.developer  (client/server development issues)
comp.infosystems.www.navigator  (navigating the web, authoring, etc)

A "document" in the hypertext world can have thousands of nodes spread
all over the world.  And each node can be shared by an unlimited number
of different document all with different navigational needs.

Whoops, just sent something to this effect to Nat Torkington because I
forgot to edit the headers...

I think a unified c.i.announce would probably be sufficient, since it's
moderated -- especially if all postings started with the name of the
infosys...  I even alluded to being willing to moderate, although I don't
have time to write the new group proposal this week... but don't go writing
me into any proposals without at least warning me :-)

I hear you, it just seems like overkill to drag in the hierarchical
structure when both versions have the "all bets are off when you have
ordinal references applying to incorrect versions" problem.

On second thought, it would be much more concise to delete an entire
section, i.e., it would be handy for addressing the interior nodes in
the document tree, as opposed to addressing the leaves.

Speaking of sections, your point is well taken about HTML missing chances
to define structure, especially with sectioning tags.  Could HTML+ define
an <H> tag, which is a container?  Doesn't sound hard to implement, just
incremement and decrement a level counter and do the same thing as
explicit tags of that level.  Browsers can choose a threshold beyond
which formatting doesn't change.

I would strongly second this.  I filter the gobs of mail out automagically via procmail - 
it would certainly make it easier to follow the discussions of interest.  Since we're
discussing more mail groups, I have a general question - is there a general rule of thumb
here on when to send mail and when to post to usenet?  The only working rules I can find
so far is that if it involves HTML+, send it to the mail group and that anything of significant
interest should go to both.

Hi,

What format should I have my PostScript file in order for a PostScript
viewer to display it? (I suppose that ghostview gets called.)

However, I read somewhere that because ghostview does not operate in
a SAFE mode, xmosaic does not call ghostview anymore. (Is this correct?)

Do I need a special header aside from this?

Any help appreciated.

I listed the interesting changes to existing practice in the notes (though
Mosaic does most of them already).  Things are pretty much frozen now for
HTML and HTTP/1.0.

If a document contains:
    <LINK REL="Style" HREF="http://www.ora.com/sample-style.style">
Then the broswer can retrieve the UR* and use it as a style guide
for rendering the document.  The details are in the Style Guide
proposal which I don't have a pointer to, someone else will have
to provide us with that information.  Everyone pretty much agreed
that it would work and would be easy to implement so until we get
a prototype implementation there isn't really much more to do other
than document it.

Basically it looked like:
{ @DEFAULT ... }
{ @TITLE font(size=24) }
{ @BODY font(family=sans-serif,size=18) }
...
Where all the values are defined in the proposal.

This doesn't change HTML or HTTP/1.0 so it doesn't have to be part of
the official RFC (though I suspect REL="Style" will be in the suggested
<LINK> relationships).

You're welcome.  I don't know, each splinter group had different ONT's.

This came up during the discussion of HTML+ at WWWWW. 
I agree that SGML DTDs usually nest section containers to
indicate the structure of the document. I have a concern
that this conflicts with the chunking of information into
small files for usable performance at delivery time.  I
have a 1000 page System Administrator's Guide that I want
to put on line. I cannot put that into one document file,
because the time to transmit that whole thing over the net
for one HREF link is not good for the network or the user.
And the user had better have a big cache for their
second HREF |^).  

I need to break this large hierarchical document into
lots of smaller files, divided mostly along section
boundaries. Then an HREF delivers a small chunk
quickly.  But if the DTD specifies nested sections,
can each file be valid SGML?  Here are two scenarios
(using hypothetical <S> section containers).

Scenario 1:                         Scenario 2:
<BODY>                              <BODY>
<S3>                                <S1>
<TITLE>Printer setup</TITLE>        <S2>
blah                                <S3>
</S3>                               <TITLE>Printer setup</TITLE>
</BODY>                             blah
                                    </S3>
                                    </S2>
                                    </S1>
                                    </BODY>

Scenario 1 is an <S3> element without its <S1> and <S2>
containers, and most hierarchical DTDs would not consider
this document fragment parseable.  Of course a DTD could
be written to allow the BODY to start with any section
level. But haven't you lost the hierarchy for this
document then?

Scenario 2 has phony placeholding containers that
actually occur in other files. Although it is parseable, it
is clearly an abuse of SGML.

In either case, I still would like to
provide information to connect the <S3> section to its
parent, children, and siblings.  The very act of
breaking up the large document means I have to
provide some mechanism to indicate those connections,
either with the LINK mechanism in HTML or as some
IDREF attributes in the <S> tags.  There should
be enough information to reassemble the 
hierarchy starting from any point in the hierarchy.

I wanted to support Bob Stayton's suggestion about storing hierarchy

Given the nature of a web, where you can make every chunk accessible
off the net, if the original document depended on hierarchical context
and containment to provide some information then you definitely don't
want to lose that information.

Hierarchy keeps going out of style (though it never quite gets all the
way there).  However, I'll go out on a limb and say I'm still in favor
of it. :-)  Putting in specialized IDREF attributes in <S> tags for the
purpose of recording their hierarchical context seems like a good thing
to do.  (You could break the hierarchy in weird ways if you really

I don't think every last piece does need to be made
accessible separately. You are right, not everything can be
written in a modular fashion. It requires a conscious
design on the part of the author.  The author must know
what levels will define topics and provide context where
necessary. For that reason, it cannot be done automatically
by, say, a server.  Many topics could have subsections
contained in them.  In that particular example, the
document is large and deep enough so that the <S3> could
stand alone, and it might contain <S4> section within the
file. Shorter documents might only make sense chunked at
the <S2> level.

All I was asking for is author *control* over how the
hierarchy gets broken up and reassembled.

Given the nature of a web, where you can make every chunk accessible
off the net, if the original document depended on hierarchical context
and containment to provide some information then you definitely don't
want to lose that information.

Hierarchy keeps going out of style (though it never quite gets all the
way there).  However, I'll go out on a limb and say I'm still in favor
of it. :-)  Putting in specialized IDREF attributes in <S> tags for the
purpose of recording their hierarchical context seems like a good thing
to do.  (You could break the hierarchy in weird ways if you really
wanted to, by going around in circles or whatever; this would be
problematic for traditional hardcopy output if the pieces weren't

I strongly endorse Ed's proposed setup. (Minor quibble -- would
'developer' be more descriptive than 'programmer'? Even if so, if
'programmer' is the convention elsewhere, that's the way to go.)

A moderated Announce group would be tremendously helpful, especially if
it were archived somewhere. And of course Nat's FAQ would be appropriate
for periodical announcement or posting.

In "marketing" WWW, it's important that information be accessible to
*folks who are not yet on the Web*. I've suggested to TimBL
that CERN run a tiny Gopher for this purpose, with perhaps a single
descriptive document, a Telnet Lynx session, and a GIF screen image from
Mosaic. This newsgroup layout would be similarly accessible to the
masses who haven't yet seen the Web, while splitting off the voluminous
developer dialogue.

Subject: SGML/HTML (long)
Status: RO

Something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently is the issue
``is HTML a presentation or a semantic encoding'', and one justifiable
view is that if you want semantic encoding you should be writing in
another DTD that represents the semantics you want (DocBook, ManPage,
Memo, HypertextThingie) and translating it to a presentation language
for presentation.

This is because HTML can no way, no how, encode all the semantics that
Real Live Authors want.  The whole point of SGML is that you can
encode all the semantics you want, and leave presentation as a later
translation.  To force the author into the very limited semantics
provided by HTML (headings, lists, emphasis, paragraphs) is to render
useless the enormous amount of effort that has gone into designing the
various DTDs.  I guess that hypertext links would have to be regarded
as common to all the DTDs, to provide hypertextishness.

This is one extreme.  The other extreme is to regard it as a semantics
only encoding, in which case it is going to have to be a bloody big
DTD to cope with all the semantics that authors typically have.  This
also would mean that we should ship style sheets with documents;
authors need control over presentation.  To remove this	control from
authors is rude, and to claim that the whole point of SGML is that
authors don't have to worry about it is only half-true --- SGML
separates the presentation from the semantics, but doesn't dictate
that authors can't control the presentation.

The midway is a compromise, and is what we have now.  It encodes some
minimal set of semantics (currently represented by paragraphs, titles,
emphasis and (unlikely) headings) and some minimal set of abstract
presentation (headings, bold, preformatted).  The minimal semantics
are geared to presentation and don't utilise the full semantic power
of SGML.  The presentation markup is abstract, for example it
specifies headings, but not the point-size and font.

I wouldn't mind seeing the first option implemented, and a set of
useful DTDs and conversion tools made available (or encode the
conversion tools to the server).  I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise, though.

As long as it's a valid PostScript file (according to the Adobe
specs), Ghostview/Ghostscript should be able to display it.

That's correct for the default case (for Mosaic 1.2).  However, the
latest ghostview is fixed so eventually we'll be switching back.  For
now, all you have to do is set:

XMosaic*postscriptViewerCommand: ghostview

....to get the previous behavior from Mosaic.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Here is a rough draft of a proposal for various MIME type information
to be used with HTTP.  Any comments?  Hopefully from someone that knows
the MIME standard pretty well and point out conflits (though some are
intentional where I think MIME is broken).

Here are a couple of examples of what it would look like:

Request:
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85

Complex return type:
  Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar"; encoding="compress, uuencode"




<HEAD>
<TITLE>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal (rough draft)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal</H1>

Here are my proposed values for various types of data.  The Client
profile information is data the client can send along with the Accept:
field so the server can better choose the return data type.
For example:
<PRE>
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85
</PRE>

With this additional information the server can try to make better choices
about the data it returns like the Aspect Ratio, image size, color or B&W,
etc. <P>

Types marked with a `*' are standard MIME types: <P>

 widths	= sample sizes (in bits, e.g., "widths="1,8,16")
</PRE>

I encourage browsers to have MIME type -> action be user definable.
Something like: <P>

    audio/basic		audio_play
    text/html		internal-html
    text/*		internal-text

An alternative would be to allow execution from your "save as" dialog
like rn does (e.g., "|patch" does what you would expect). <P>

Subject: SGML/HTML (long)
Status: RO

Something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently is the issue
``is HTML a presentation or a semantic encoding'', and one justifiable
view is that if you want semantic encoding you should be writing in
another DTD that represents the semantics you want (DocBook, ManPage,
Memo, HypertextThingie) and translating it to a presentation language
for presentation.

This is because HTML can no way, no how, encode all the semantics that
Real Live Authors want.  The whole point of SGML is that you can
encode all the semantics you want, and leave presentation as a later
translation.  To force the author into the very limited semantics
provided by HTML (headings, lists, emphasis, paragraphs) is to render
useless the enormous amount of effort that has gone into designing the
various DTDs.  I guess that hypertext links would have to be regarded
as common to all the DTDs, to provide hypertextishness.

This is one extreme.  The other extreme is to regard it as a semantics
only encoding, in which case it is going to have to be a bloody big
DTD to cope with all the semantics that authors typically have.  This
also would mean that we should ship style sheets with documents;
authors need control over presentation.  To remove this	control from
authors is rude, and to claim that the whole point of SGML is that
authors don't have to worry about it is only half-true --- SGML
separates the presentation from the semantics, but doesn't dictate
that authors can't control the presentation.

The midway is a compromise, and is what we have now.  It encodes some
minimal set of semantics (currently represented by paragraphs, titles,
emphasis and (unlikely) headings) and some minimal set of abstract
presentation (headings, bold, preformatted).  The minimal semantics
are geared to presentation and don't utilise the full semantic power
of SGML.  The presentation markup is abstract, for example it
specifies headings, but not the point-size and font.

I wouldn't mind seeing the first option implemented, and a set of
useful DTDs and conversion tools made available (or encode the
conversion tools to the server).  I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise, though.

Nat.

I wanted to support Bob Stayton's suggestion about storing hierarchy
information in a flat way in links:

 >In either case, I still would like to
 >provide information to connect the <S3> section to its
 >parent, children, and siblings.  The very act of
 >breaking up the large document means I have to
 >provide some mechanism to indicate those connections,
 >either with the LINK mechanism in HTML or as some

 >hierarchy starting from any point in the hierarchy.

Given the nature of a web, where you can make every chunk accessible
off the net, if the original document depended on hierarchical context
and containment to provide some information then you definitely don't
want to lose that information.

Hierarchy keeps going out of style (though it never quite gets all the
way there).  However, I'll go out on a limb and say I'm still in favor
of it. :-)  Putting in specialized IDREF attributes in <S> tags for the
purpose of recording their hierarchical context seems like a good thing
to do.  (You could break the hierarchy in weird ways if you really
wanted to, by going around in circles or whatever; this would be
problematic for traditional hardcopy output if the pieces weren't
nested in the original source.)

I do wonder, however, why every last piece of a document needs to be
made accessible separately.  Not everything can be written modularly
down to the last paragraph, and sometimes subtrees should simply travel
together.  In the terms of Bob's example, why was that fictitious
section at level 3?  Would it make any sense if someone were to read it
without reading all the levels above?  If not, either it shouldn't be
accessible all by itself or it should be rewritten to be in less need
of its context.

I don't think every last piece does need to be made
accessible separately. You are right, not everything can be
written in a modular fashion. It requires a conscious
design on the part of the author.  The author must know
what levels will define topics and provide context where
necessary. For that reason, it cannot be done automatically
by, say, a server.  Many topics could have subsections
contained in them.  In that particular example, the
document is large and deep enough so that the <S3> could
stand alone, and it might contain <S4> section within the
file. Shorter documents might only make sense chunked at
the <S2> level.

All I was asking for is author *control* over how the
hierarchy gets broken up and reassembled.

<H1>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal</H1>

Here are my proposed values for various types of data.  The Client
profile information is data the client can send along with the Accept:
field so the server can better choose the return data type.
For example:
<PRE>
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85
</PRE>

With this additional information the server can try to make better choices
about the data it returns like the Aspect Ratio, image size, color or B&W,
etc. <P>

Types marked with a `*' are standard MIME types: <P>

I encourage browsers to have MIME type -> action be user definable.

    audio/basic		audio_play
    text/html		internal-html
    text/*		internal-text
    */*			internal-save-as
</PRE>

An alternative would be to allow execution from your "save as" dialog
like rn does (e.g., "|patch" does what you would expect). <P>

I strongly endorse Ed's proposed setup. (Minor quibble -- would
'developer' be more descriptive than 'programmer'? Even if so, if
'programmer' is the convention elsewhere, that's the way to go.)

A moderated Announce group would be tremendously helpful, especially if
it were archived somewhere. And of course Nat's FAQ would be appropriate
for periodical announcement or posting.

In "marketing" WWW, it's important that information be accessible to
*folks who are not yet on the Web*. I've suggested to TimBL
that CERN run a tiny Gopher for this purpose, with perhaps a single
descriptive document, a Telnet Lynx session, and a GIF screen image from
Mosaic. This newsgroup layout would be similarly accessible to the
masses who haven't yet seen the Web, while splitting off the voluminous
developer dialogue.

Subject: SGML/HTML (long)
Status: RO

Something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently is the issue
``is HTML a presentation or a semantic encoding'', and one justifiable
view is that if you want semantic encoding you should be writing in
another DTD that represents the semantics you want (DocBook, ManPage,
Memo, HypertextThingie) and translating it to a presentation language
for presentation.

This is because HTML can no way, no how, encode all the semantics that
Real Live Authors want.  The whole point of SGML is that you can
encode all the semantics you want, and leave presentation as a later
translation.  To force the author into the very limited semantics
provided by HTML (headings, lists, emphasis, paragraphs) is to render
useless the enormous amount of effort that has gone into designing the
various DTDs.  I guess that hypertext links would have to be regarded
as common to all the DTDs, to provide hypertextishness.

This is one extreme.  The other extreme is to regard it as a semantics
only encoding, in which case it is going to have to be a bloody big
DTD to cope with all the semantics that authors typically have.  This
also would mean that we should ship style sheets with documents;
authors need control over presentation.  To remove this	control from
authors is rude, and to claim that the whole point of SGML is that
authors don't have to worry about it is only half-true --- SGML
separates the presentation from the semantics, but doesn't dictate
that authors can't control the presentation.

The midway is a compromise, and is what we have now.  It encodes some
minimal set of semantics (currently represented by paragraphs, titles,
emphasis and (unlikely) headings) and some minimal set of abstract
presentation (headings, bold, preformatted).  The minimal semantics
are geared to presentation and don't utilise the full semantic power
of SGML.  The presentation markup is abstract, for example it
specifies headings, but not the point-size and font.

I wouldn't mind seeing the first option implemented, and a set of
useful DTDs and conversion tools made available (or encode the
conversion tools to the server).  I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise, though.

Nat.

Subject: Annotations and SGML structure
Status: RO

There are two issues here:
 --- placing annotations precisely
and
 --- differentiating between versions

Something like the following seems workable:

	The document is fetched by the client, who checks whether the
	document has annotations by asking the annotation server for
	the headers of the annotations of this URL.  The signatures
	of the current document and the signatures kept in the headers
	are compared, and the current annotations are added to the
	document (as links or as marginal notes or ...).  If there are
	out-of-date annotations, they appear as a message saying
	``this document had the following annotations on a previous
	version'' and the titles/authors/whatever appear as a <MENU>
	and are selectable.

The placement of annotations can be done on a byte-offset basis,
because the accuracy needs to be pin-point for the current document
and is ignored for previous versions.

As long as it's a valid PostScript file (according to the Adobe
specs), Ghostview/Ghostscript should be able to display it.

That's correct for the default case (for Mosaic 1.2).  However, the
latest ghostview is fixed so eventually we'll be switching back.  For
now, all you have to do is set:

XMosaic*postscriptViewerCommand: ghostview

....to get the previous behavior from Mosaic.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Cheers,
Marc

I don't think every last piece does need to be made
accessible separately. You are right, not everything can be
written in a modular fashion. It requires a conscious
design on the part of the author.  The author must know
what levels will define topics and provide context where
necessary. For that reason, it cannot be done automatically
by, say, a server.  Many topics could have subsections
contained in them.  In that particular example, the
document is large and deep enough so that the <S3> could
stand alone, and it might contain <S4> section within the
file. Shorter documents might only make sense chunked at
the <S2> level.

All I was asking for is author *control* over how the
hierarchy gets broken up and reassembled.

Here is a rough draft of a proposal for various MIME type information
to be used with HTTP.  Any comments?  Hopefully from someone that knows
the MIME standard pretty well and point out conflits (though some are
intentional where I think MIME is broken).

Here are a couple of examples of what it would look like:

Request:
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85

Complex return type:
  Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar"; encoding="compress, uuencode"

I encourage browsers to have MIME type -> action be user definable.
Something like: <P>

    audio/basic		audio_play
    text/html		internal-html
    text/*		internal-text
    */*			internal-save-as

An alternative would be to allow execution from your "save as" dialog
like rn does (e.g., "|patch" does what you would expect). <P>

I wanted to support Bob Stayton's suggestion about storing hierarchy

Given the nature of a web, where you can make every chunk accessible
off the net, if the original document depended on hierarchical context
and containment to provide some information then you definitely don't
want to lose that information.

Hierarchy keeps going out of style (though it never quite gets all the
way there).  However, I'll go out on a limb and say I'm still in favor
of it. :-)  Putting in specialized IDREF attributes in <S> tags for the
purpose of recording their hierarchical context seems like a good thing
to do.  (You could break the hierarchy in weird ways if you really
wanted to, by going around in circles or whatever; this would be
problematic for traditional hardcopy output if the pieces weren't
nested in the original source.)

I do wonder, however, why every last piece of a document needs to be
made accessible separately.  Not everything can be written modularly
down to the last paragraph, and sometimes subtrees should simply travel
together.  In the terms of Bob's example, why was that fictitious
section at level 3?  Would it make any sense if someone were to read it
without reading all the levels above?  If not, either it shouldn't be
accessible all by itself or it should be rewritten to be in less need
of its context.

Please don't argue for placing annotations on the basis
of offsets.  Someone recently pointed out (and out and out,
given the current condition of www-talk!) that as long as
we're in SGML we ought to use anchors (real anchors, not
the HTML element called Anchor) to place annotations.  If
the annotated object has an ID already, that will do
instead of an anchor.  HTMLplus has the Note element

Now, can anyone see problems with using anchors across

I strongly endorse Ed's proposed setup. (Minor quibble -- would
'developer' be more descriptive than 'programmer'? Even if so, if
'programmer' is the convention elsewhere, that's the way to go.)

A moderated Announce group would be tremendously helpful, especially if
it were archived somewhere. And of course Nat's FAQ would be appropriate
for periodical announcement or posting.

In "marketing" WWW, it's important that information be accessible to
*folks who are not yet on the Web*. I've suggested to TimBL
that CERN run a tiny Gopher for this purpose, with perhaps a single
descriptive document, a Telnet Lynx session, and a GIF screen image from
Mosaic. This newsgroup layout would be similarly accessible to the
masses who haven't yet seen the Web, while splitting off the voluminous
developer dialogue.

Subject: Annotations and SGML structure
Status: RO

There are two issues here:
 --- placing annotations precisely
and
 --- differentiating between versions

Something like the following seems workable:

	The document is fetched by the client, who checks whether the
	document has annotations by asking the annotation server for
	the headers of the annotations of this URL.  The signatures
	of the current document and the signatures kept in the headers
	are compared, and the current annotations are added to the
	document (as links or as marginal notes or ...).  If there are
	out-of-date annotations, they appear as a message saying
	``this document had the following annotations on a previous
	version'' and the titles/authors/whatever appear as a <MENU>
	and are selectable.

The placement of annotations can be done on a byte-offset basis,
because the accuracy needs to be pin-point for the current document
and is ignored for previous versions.

I don't think every last piece does need to be made
accessible separately. You are right, not everything can be
written in a modular fashion. It requires a conscious
design on the part of the author.  The author must know
what levels will define topics and provide context where
necessary. For that reason, it cannot be done automatically
by, say, a server.  Many topics could have subsections
contained in them.  In that particular example, the
document is large and deep enough so that the <S3> could
stand alone, and it might contain <S4> section within the
file. Shorter documents might only make sense chunked at
the <S2> level.

All I was asking for is author *control* over how the
hierarchy gets broken up and reassembled.

Subject: SGML/HTML (long)
Status: RO

Something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently is the issue
``is HTML a presentation or a semantic encoding'', and one justifiable
view is that if you want semantic encoding you should be writing in
another DTD that represents the semantics you want (DocBook, ManPage,
Memo, HypertextThingie) and translating it to a presentation language
for presentation.

This is because HTML can no way, no how, encode all the semantics that
Real Live Authors want.  The whole point of SGML is that you can
encode all the semantics you want, and leave presentation as a later
translation.  To force the author into the very limited semantics
provided by HTML (headings, lists, emphasis, paragraphs) is to render
useless the enormous amount of effort that has gone into designing the
various DTDs.  I guess that hypertext links would have to be regarded
as common to all the DTDs, to provide hypertextishness.

This is one extreme.  The other extreme is to regard it as a semantics
only encoding, in which case it is going to have to be a bloody big
DTD to cope with all the semantics that authors typically have.  This
also would mean that we should ship style sheets with documents;
authors need control over presentation.  To remove this	control from
authors is rude, and to claim that the whole point of SGML is that
authors don't have to worry about it is only half-true --- SGML
separates the presentation from the semantics, but doesn't dictate
that authors can't control the presentation.

The midway is a compromise, and is what we have now.  It encodes some
minimal set of semantics (currently represented by paragraphs, titles,
emphasis and (unlikely) headings) and some minimal set of abstract
presentation (headings, bold, preformatted).  The minimal semantics
are geared to presentation and don't utilise the full semantic power
of SGML.  The presentation markup is abstract, for example it
specifies headings, but not the point-size and font.

I wouldn't mind seeing the first option implemented, and a set of
useful DTDs and conversion tools made available (or encode the
conversion tools to the server).  I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise, though.

As long as it's a valid PostScript file (according to the Adobe
specs), Ghostview/Ghostscript should be able to display it.

That's correct for the default case (for Mosaic 1.2).  However, the
latest ghostview is fixed so eventually we'll be switching back.  For
now, all you have to do is set:

XMosaic*postscriptViewerCommand: ghostview

....to get the previous behavior from Mosaic.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Cheers,
Marc

Here is a rough draft of a proposal for various MIME type information
to be used with HTTP.  Any comments?  Hopefully from someone that knows
the MIME standard pretty well and point out conflits (though some are
intentional where I think MIME is broken).

Here are a couple of examples of what it would look like:

Request:
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85

Complex return type:
  Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar"; encoding="compress, uuencode"




<HEAD>
<TITLE>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal (rough draft)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal</H1>

Here are my proposed values for various types of data.  The Client
profile information is data the client can send along with the Accept:
field so the server can better choose the return data type.
For example:
<PRE>
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85
</PRE>

With this additional information the server can try to make better choices
about the data it returns like the Aspect Ratio, image size, color or B&W,
etc. <P>

Types marked with a `*' are standard MIME types: <P>

Common Attributes:
 q		= quality factor (float between 0 and 1 inclusive)
 mxb		= max transmission bytes
 mxt		= max transmission time in seconds
 name		= document name (this is just a hint for save diaglogs)
 type		= data type (mostly used with application/octet-stream)

 encoding	=	    	Description
	hqx 	 	hqx	Mac Compressed
	gzip 	 	z	Gnu Zip Compressed
	zip 	 	zip	gzip Compressed
	compress	Z	compress'ed
	uuencode	uu	uuencode'ed
	btoa		btoa	btoa'ed

	Multiple encodings are possible and should be applied right to left
	e.g., foo.tar.Z.uu would be encoded as:
	    Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar";
	                  encoding="compress, uuencode"

Extended attributes for all image and video types:
 class	= gray / color
 depth	= bitplanes (commonly 1, 4, 8, 16, 24)
 width	= pixels
 height	= pixels
 xdpi	= x dpi
 ydpi	= y dpi

Extended attributes for audio types:
 srates	= sample rates (in Hz, e.g., srates="8000,22000")
 widths	= sample sizes (in bits, e.g., "widths="1,8,16")
</PRE>

I encourage browsers to have MIME type -> action be user definable.
Something like: <P>

<PRE>
    image/*		xv
    video/mpeg		mpeg_play
    audio/basic		audio_play
    text/html		internal-html
    text/*		internal-text
    */*			internal-save-as
</PRE>

An alternative would be to allow execution from your "save as" dialog
like rn does (e.g., "|patch" does what you would expect). <P>

At the risk of flooding the net simply by sending a new msg to
www-talk tonight...

The way you (we) want to think of annotations is this: they're virtual
document modifications that may exist on any of several levels: fully
public but not physically attached to the document, fully public and
physically attached to the document [ecccch, I hope nobody actually
implements these], limited to a given subgroup of people, limited to
those who have expressed interest in the opinions of the annotator,
personal, etc.

This means the document author should not a priori be able to
"restrict" or "enhance" the capability of people to add annotations
that are not physically part of her document.  That is, you at
O'Reilly should not be able to affect how I at NCSA can add an
annotation to your document that can only be viewed by others at NCSA
-- and vice versa.  As long as the annotation isn't actually,
physically affecting your document, you shouldn't care what I do with
the annotation.  (Concomitantly, browsers should provide user
interfaces sufficiently well-designed to make it clear what's really
part of the document and what's an annotation added by some yoyo at
NCSA.)

With some of the annotation systems we are talking about, we will be
dealing with the problems of scale (thousands of annotations) you
mention: those systems are the public systems [actually, "public"
annotations maintained by the same server storing the document itself
and "global" annotations distributed through a global Usenet-style
network of communicating servers, in my current taxonomy].  

There are and will be other annotation systems, or levels, (e.g. the
ones that exist today -- personal and workgroup) where the scale issue
will not be a problem, as very few people (and therefore relatively
few annotations) will be involved and you will a priori (there's that
term again) care about the opinions of those leaving the annotations
(else you could not (a) be yourself or (b) have that group's
annotation server on your list of annotation servers).

Further, mechanisms like kill files, and in the future more
sophisticated mechanisms (c.f. the collaborative filtering work going
on at Xerox PARC -- there was an interesting paper in CACM a while ago
-- basically, you say to the system one way or another "I respect
Bill's opinion but not Joe's" and the system gives you Bill's
annotations but not Joe's), will let you weed out the good stuff from
the bad stuff.

So I don't think we have to worry about "too many annotations".
You'll always just be able to disregard/ignore the ones you don't want
to see, since they will practically never be physically attached to
the documents themselves and the act of fetching and displaying them
will always be a value-add your browser will perform only if you want
it too (I myself would probably never have my browser display any
fully public annotations, etc.)

If we implement a system where a user can place an annotation in the
middle of this paragraph but not in the middle of *this* paragraph, or
at the end of this section but only at the beginning of *this*
section, etc. -- which is what will happen if annotation locations are
tracked solely by the preexisting names/anchors/id's in the document
-- users will be seriously confused and turned off.  I have nightmares
about 300 email messages a day from neophyte users saying "You have a
bug in Mosaic -- I can't place annotations where I want, except in
these three cases...."

OK, www-talk mail robot, do your worst...

I strongly endorse Ed's proposed setup. (Minor quibble -- would
'developer' be more descriptive than 'programmer'? Even if so, if
'programmer' is the convention elsewhere, that's the way to go.)

A moderated Announce group would be tremendously helpful, especially if
it were archived somewhere. And of course Nat's FAQ would be appropriate
for periodical announcement or posting.

In "marketing" WWW, it's important that information be accessible to
*folks who are not yet on the Web*. I've suggested to TimBL
that CERN run a tiny Gopher for this purpose, with perhaps a single
descriptive document, a Telnet Lynx session, and a GIF screen image from
Mosaic. This newsgroup layout would be similarly accessible to the
masses who haven't yet seen the Web, while splitting off the voluminous
developer dialogue.

Ick!  Annotations are entirely user-based, and this author-provision
stuff seems irrelevant.

*ahem*.  Here is a section from ``The Day the Universe Changed'' by
James Burke, on the formation of modern law.  It shows how annotations
were used originally, and still are today.  When I go to annotate
something, I usually annotate only a part of the document (something
tricky, something wrong or the crucial step in reasoning) rather than
the whole thing.

   Law had always been part of the training in the trivium, whose rhetoric
   course was subdivided into demonstrative, deliberative and judicial
   argument.  The `judicial' part had been taught in Pavia and in Ravenna,
   the ancient capital of the Byzantine Viceroy, as well as in Rome
   itself.  The major difficulty was that the material was piecemeal.  The
   great compendium of Roman law created by the Emperor Justinian and
   known as the Corpus Juris Civilis (Body of Civil Laws) had been lost
   since 603.  There had also been a key to the laws, the Digest, which
   contained a summary of all the main points.  Only two copies of the
   Digest had survived, and their whereabouts were unknown.

   Then, in 1076, a liberal arts teacher called Irnerius found a copy of
   the Digest, most probably in the library of the Royal Law School in
   Ravenna, close to Bologna where he lived.  The discovery of the Digest
   and the subsequent use which Irnerius and his successors made of it was
   of major importance in Western European history, because it put all
   Roman law into the hands of both the Church and the citizen. While this
   fact alone was to have far-reaching effects on the development of the
   West in economic and political terms, what was to have even greater
   impact was the way in which the Digest was edited.

   The Digest was extremely complex and difficult to understand, often
   referring to situations and concepts of which the medieval European
   lawyer was only dimly aware.  It was immensely sophisticated, compiled
   and refined as it had been through the centuries from early Rome until
   Justinian's time to serve the greatest empire in the world.  It was a
   system which those with the limited experience of the early Middle Ages
   could not easily comprehend.  Irnerius made the Digest easier to use by
   `glossing' it.  Glossing was a technique already in use which involved
   the addition of notes, analyses and commentaries to the margin of a
   manuscript.  These glosses were generally used as lecture notes by
   teachers interpreting the text for their students.

   At the monastery of St Stephen, Irnerius expounded his system.  The aim
   was to elucidate the literal meaning of every sentence and to give
   coherence to the subject-matter as a whole.  As an aid to the
   understanding of each sentence in the text, he advised that the teacher
   should provide synonyms for difficult words, add notes to clarify an
   obscure sentence structure, and explain any unfamiliar custom to which
   the text referred.  Teachers were also to prepare summulae (notes
   summing up whole areas of law), continuationes(summaries of different
   groups of laws) and distinctiones (variations on the hypothetical cases
   described).

   The novelty of this approach cannot be overestimated.  At the time, all
   over Europe, ``going to the law'' still meant visiting a priest who
   would pray for signs and give what advice he could.  It might often
   involve the ordeal of trial by fire, or by tying up suspected persons
   and throwing them into a river; if they drowned, they had been
   innocent.  Much legal decision-making was left to astrologers, who
   would judge right or wrong according to the accused man's date of
   birth.  To approach the matter of jurisprudence in a rational and
   analytical way was a tremendous step forward.

Surely removing annotations from their source is (a) asking for
confusion and (b) a bit silly 'cos if annotations refer to a specific
part of the text then putting them elsewhere is contrary to the
intentions of the author of the annotation.

I envision a system like Usenet news, but with no expiry (deletion is
by request only).  Threading is essential in this case.

There are two issues here:
 --- placing annotations precisely
and
 --- differentiating between versions

Something like the following seems workable:

	The document is fetched by the client, who checks whether the
	document has annotations by asking the annotation server for
	the headers of the annotations of this URL.  The signatures
	of the current document and the signatures kept in the headers
	are compared, and the current annotations are added to the
	document (as links or as marginal notes or ...).  If there are
	out-of-date annotations, they appear as a message saying
	``this document had the following annotations on a previous
	version'' and the titles/authors/whatever appear as a <MENU>
	and are selectable.

The placement of annotations can be done on a byte-offset basis,
because the accuracy needs to be pin-point for the current document
and is ignored for previous versions.

I wanted to support Bob Stayton's suggestion about storing hierarchy
information in a flat way in links:

Given the nature of a web, where you can make every chunk accessible
off the net, if the original document depended on hierarchical context
and containment to provide some information then you definitely don't
want to lose that information.

Hierarchy keeps going out of style (though it never quite gets all the
way there).  However, I'll go out on a limb and say I'm still in favor
of it. :-)  Putting in specialized IDREF attributes in <S> tags for the
purpose of recording their hierarchical context seems like a good thing
to do.  (You could break the hierarchy in weird ways if you really
wanted to, by going around in circles or whatever; this would be
problematic for traditional hardcopy output if the pieces weren't
nested in the original source.)

I do wonder, however, why every last piece of a document needs to be
made accessible separately.  Not everything can be written modularly
down to the last paragraph, and sometimes subtrees should simply travel
together.  In the terms of Bob's example, why was that fictitious
section at level 3?  Would it make any sense if someone were to read it
without reading all the levels above?  If not, either it shouldn't be
accessible all by itself or it should be rewritten to be in less need
of its context.

Please don't argue for placing annotations on the basis
of offsets.  Someone recently pointed out (and out and out,
given the current condition of www-talk!) that as long as
we're in SGML we ought to use anchors (real anchors, not
the HTML element called Anchor) to place annotations.  If
the annotated object has an ID already, that will do
instead of an anchor.  HTMLplus has the Note element
precisely to provide anchors for annotations.

Now, can anyone see problems with using anchors across 
versions?

I don't think every last piece does need to be made
accessible separately. You are right, not everything can be
written in a modular fashion. It requires a conscious
design on the part of the author.  The author must know
what levels will define topics and provide context where
necessary. For that reason, it cannot be done automatically
by, say, a server.  Many topics could have subsections
contained in them.  In that particular example, the
document is large and deep enough so that the <S3> could
stand alone, and it might contain <S4> section within the
file. Shorter documents might only make sense chunked at
the <S2> level.

All I was asking for is author *control* over how the
hierarchy gets broken up and reassembled.

At the risk of flooding the net simply by sending a new msg to
www-talk tonight...

The way you (we) want to think of annotations is this: they're virtual
document modifications that may exist on any of several levels: fully
public but not physically attached to the document, fully public and
physically attached to the document [ecccch, I hope nobody actually
implements these], limited to a given subgroup of people, limited to
those who have expressed interest in the opinions of the annotator,
personal, etc.

This means the document author should not a priori be able to
"restrict" or "enhance" the capability of people to add annotations
that are not physically part of her document.  That is, you at
O'Reilly should not be able to affect how I at NCSA can add an
annotation to your document that can only be viewed by others at NCSA
-- and vice versa.  As long as the annotation isn't actually,
physically affecting your document, you shouldn't care what I do with
the annotation.  (Concomitantly, browsers should provide user
interfaces sufficiently well-designed to make it clear what's really
part of the document and what's an annotation added by some yoyo at
NCSA.)

With some of the annotation systems we are talking about, we will be
dealing with the problems of scale (thousands of annotations) you
mention: those systems are the public systems [actually, "public"
annotations maintained by the same server storing the document itself
and "global" annotations distributed through a global Usenet-style
network of communicating servers, in my current taxonomy].  

There are and will be other annotation systems, or levels, (e.g. the
ones that exist today -- personal and workgroup) where the scale issue
will not be a problem, as very few people (and therefore relatively
few annotations) will be involved and you will a priori (there's that
term again) care about the opinions of those leaving the annotations
(else you could not (a) be yourself or (b) have that group's
annotation server on your list of annotation servers).

Further, mechanisms like kill files, and in the future more
sophisticated mechanisms (c.f. the collaborative filtering work going
on at Xerox PARC -- there was an interesting paper in CACM a while ago
-- basically, you say to the system one way or another "I respect
Bill's opinion but not Joe's" and the system gives you Bill's
annotations but not Joe's), will let you weed out the good stuff from
the bad stuff.

So I don't think we have to worry about "too many annotations".
You'll always just be able to disregard/ignore the ones you don't want
to see, since they will practically never be physically attached to
the documents themselves and the act of fetching and displaying them
will always be a value-add your browser will perform only if you want
it too (I myself would probably never have my browser display any
fully public annotations, etc.)

If we implement a system where a user can place an annotation in the
middle of this paragraph but not in the middle of *this* paragraph, or
at the end of this section but only at the beginning of *this*
section, etc. -- which is what will happen if annotation locations are
tracked solely by the preexisting names/anchors/id's in the document
-- users will be seriously confused and turned off.  I have nightmares
about 300 email messages a day from neophyte users saying "You have a
bug in Mosaic -- I can't place annotations where I want, except in
these three cases...."

OK, www-talk mail robot, do your worst...

As long as it's a valid PostScript file (according to the Adobe
specs), Ghostview/Ghostscript should be able to display it.

That's correct for the default case (for Mosaic 1.2).  However, the
latest ghostview is fixed so eventually we'll be switching back.  For
now, all you have to do is set:

XMosaic*postscriptViewerCommand: ghostview

....to get the previous behavior from Mosaic.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Cheers,

Ick!  Annotations are entirely user-based, and this author-provision
stuff seems irrelevant.

*ahem*.  Here is a section from ``The Day the Universe Changed'' by
James Burke, on the formation of modern law.  It shows how annotations
were used originally, and still are today.  When I go to annotate
something, I usually annotate only a part of the document (something
tricky, something wrong or the crucial step in reasoning) rather than
the whole thing.

   Law had always been part of the training in the trivium, whose rhetoric
   course was subdivided into demonstrative, deliberative and judicial
   argument.  The `judicial' part had been taught in Pavia and in Ravenna,
   the ancient capital of the Byzantine Viceroy, as well as in Rome
   itself.  The major difficulty was that the material was piecemeal.  The
   great compendium of Roman law created by the Emperor Justinian and
   known as the Corpus Juris Civilis (Body of Civil Laws) had been lost
   since 603.  There had also been a key to the laws, the Digest, which
   contained a summary of all the main points.  Only two copies of the
   Digest had survived, and their whereabouts were unknown.

   Then, in 1076, a liberal arts teacher called Irnerius found a copy of
   the Digest, most probably in the library of the Royal Law School in
   Ravenna, close to Bologna where he lived.  The discovery of the Digest
   and the subsequent use which Irnerius and his successors made of it was
   of major importance in Western European history, because it put all
   Roman law into the hands of both the Church and the citizen. While this
   fact alone was to have far-reaching effects on the development of the
   West in economic and political terms, what was to have even greater
   impact was the way in which the Digest was edited.

   The Digest was extremely complex and difficult to understand, often
   referring to situations and concepts of which the medieval European
   lawyer was only dimly aware.  It was immensely sophisticated, compiled
   and refined as it had been through the centuries from early Rome until
   Justinian's time to serve the greatest empire in the world.  It was a
   system which those with the limited experience of the early Middle Ages
   could not easily comprehend.  Irnerius made the Digest easier to use by
   `glossing' it.  Glossing was a technique already in use which involved
   the addition of notes, analyses and commentaries to the margin of a
   manuscript.  These glosses were generally used as lecture notes by
   teachers interpreting the text for their students.

   At the monastery of St Stephen, Irnerius expounded his system.  The aim
   was to elucidate the literal meaning of every sentence and to give
   coherence to the subject-matter as a whole.  As an aid to the
   understanding of each sentence in the text, he advised that the teacher
   should provide synonyms for difficult words, add notes to clarify an
   obscure sentence structure, and explain any unfamiliar custom to which
   the text referred.  Teachers were also to prepare summulae (notes
   summing up whole areas of law), continuationes(summaries of different
   groups of laws) and distinctiones (variations on the hypothetical cases
   described).

   The novelty of this approach cannot be overestimated.  At the time, all
   over Europe, ``going to the law'' still meant visiting a priest who
   would pray for signs and give what advice he could.  It might often
   involve the ordeal of trial by fire, or by tying up suspected persons
   and throwing them into a river; if they drowned, they had been
   innocent.  Much legal decision-making was left to astrologers, who
   would judge right or wrong according to the accused man's date of
   birth.  To approach the matter of jurisprudence in a rational and
   analytical way was a tremendous step forward.

Surely removing annotations from their source is (a) asking for
confusion and (b) a bit silly 'cos if annotations refer to a specific
part of the text then putting them elsewhere is contrary to the
intentions of the author of the annotation.

I envision a system like Usenet news, but with no expiry (deletion is
by request only).  Threading is essential in this case.

Here is a rough draft of a proposal for various MIME type information
to be used with HTTP.  Any comments?  Hopefully from someone that knows
the MIME standard pretty well and point out conflits (though some are
intentional where I think MIME is broken).

Here are a couple of examples of what it would look like:

Request:
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85

Complex return type:
  Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar"; encoding="compress, uuencode"




<HEAD>
<TITLE>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal (rough draft)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal</H1>

Here are my proposed values for various types of data.  The Client
profile information is data the client can send along with the Accept:
field so the server can better choose the return data type.
For example:
<PRE>
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85
</PRE>

With this additional information the server can try to make better choices
about the data it returns like the Aspect Ratio, image size, color or B&W,
etc. <P>

Types marked with a `*' are standard MIME types: <P>

	                  encoding="compress, uuencode"

Extended attributes for all image and video types:

 width	= pixels
 height	= pixels
 xdpi	= x dpi
 ydpi	= y dpi

Extended attributes for audio types:
 srates	= sample rates (in Hz, e.g., srates="8000,22000")
 widths	= sample sizes (in bits, e.g., "widths="1,8,16")
</PRE>

I encourage browsers to have MIME type -> action be user definable.
Something like: <P>

<PRE>
    image/*		xv
    video/mpeg		mpeg_play
    audio/basic		audio_play
    text/html		internal-html
    text/*		internal-text
    */*			internal-save-as
</PRE>

An alternative would be to allow execution from your "save as" dialog
like rn does (e.g., "|patch" does what you would expect). <P>

I strongly endorse Ed's proposed setup. (Minor quibble -- would
'developer' be more descriptive than 'programmer'? Even if so, if
'programmer' is the convention elsewhere, that's the way to go.)

A moderated Announce group would be tremendously helpful, especially if
it were archived somewhere. And of course Nat's FAQ would be appropriate
for periodical announcement or posting.

In "marketing" WWW, it's important that information be accessible to
*folks who are not yet on the Web*. I've suggested to TimBL
that CERN run a tiny Gopher for this purpose, with perhaps a single
descriptive document, a Telnet Lynx session, and a GIF screen image from
Mosaic. This newsgroup layout would be similarly accessible to the
masses who haven't yet seen the Web, while splitting off the voluminous
developer dialogue.

Status: RO

Sorry, folks, I wasn't thinking when I rejected out of hand
the notion of offsets for storing the position of annotations
outside of a file.  But this seems like a rat's nest anyway.
Let me suggest instead that the positioning of annotations be
made at the granularity provided by the document's IDs.

That means you wouldn't be able to insert an annotation at 
any point in a paragraph (do we really need to be able to
do that?  is anyone using annotations this way for good 
reason?), and recalcitrant authors could make the granularity
of possible annotations very coarse by omitting IDs.  But
annotations would clump naturally, instead of being spread
through the document like a mist, and that might be useful.
And someone who wanted to encourage annotations could just
provide lots of IDs.

More generally, on annotations:  how can this possibly work
at a large scale?  If I have a document that the world can
annotate, and it's controversial, I could generate hundreds
of thousands of annotations (think of the number of calls to
the White House when something big is in the news).  No one
can sensibly sort through such a heap.  How do Webbers really
envision annotations working in practice?

Subject: SGML/HTML (long)
Status: RO

Something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently is the issue
``is HTML a presentation or a semantic encoding'', and one justifiable
view is that if you want semantic encoding you should be writing in
another DTD that represents the semantics you want (DocBook, ManPage,
Memo, HypertextThingie) and translating it to a presentation language
for presentation.

This is because HTML can no way, no how, encode all the semantics that
Real Live Authors want.  The whole point of SGML is that you can
encode all the semantics you want, and leave presentation as a later
translation.  To force the author into the very limited semantics
provided by HTML (headings, lists, emphasis, paragraphs) is to render
useless the enormous amount of effort that has gone into designing the
various DTDs.  I guess that hypertext links would have to be regarded

This is one extreme.  The other extreme is to regard it as a semantics
only encoding, in which case it is going to have to be a bloody big
DTD to cope with all the semantics that authors typically have.  This
also would mean that we should ship style sheets with documents;

authors is rude, and to claim that the whole point of SGML is that
authors don't have to worry about it is only half-true --- SGML
separates the presentation from the semantics, but doesn't dictate
that authors can't control the presentation.

The midway is a compromise, and is what we have now.  It encodes some
minimal set of semantics (currently represented by paragraphs, titles,
emphasis and (unlikely) headings) and some minimal set of abstract
presentation (headings, bold, preformatted).  The minimal semantics
are geared to presentation and don't utilise the full semantic power
of SGML.  The presentation markup is abstract, for example it
specifies headings, but not the point-size and font.

I wouldn't mind seeing the first option implemented, and a set of
useful DTDs and conversion tools made available (or encode the
conversion tools to the server).  I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise, though.

Subject: Annotations and SGML structure
Status: RO

There are two issues here:
 --- placing annotations precisely
and
 --- differentiating between versions

Something like the following seems workable:

	The document is fetched by the client, who checks whether the
	document has annotations by asking the annotation server for
	the headers of the annotations of this URL.  The signatures
	of the current document and the signatures kept in the headers
	are compared, and the current annotations are added to the
	document (as links or as marginal notes or ...).  If there are
	out-of-date annotations, they appear as a message saying
	``this document had the following annotations on a previous
	version'' and the titles/authors/whatever appear as a <MENU>
	and are selectable.

The placement of annotations can be done on a byte-offset basis,
because the accuracy needs to be pin-point for the current document
and is ignored for previous versions.

As long as it's a valid PostScript file (according to the Adobe
specs), Ghostview/Ghostscript should be able to display it.

That's correct for the default case (for Mosaic 1.2).  However, the
latest ghostview is fixed so eventually we'll be switching back.  For
now, all you have to do is set:

XMosaic*postscriptViewerCommand: ghostview

....to get the previous behavior from Mosaic.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Cheers,
Marc

I wanted to support Bob Stayton's suggestion about storing hierarchy
information in a flat way in links:

Given the nature of a web, where you can make every chunk accessible
off the net, if the original document depended on hierarchical context
and containment to provide some information then you definitely don't
want to lose that information.

Hierarchy keeps going out of style (though it never quite gets all the
way there).  However, I'll go out on a limb and say I'm still in favor
of it. :-)  Putting in specialized IDREF attributes in <S> tags for the
purpose of recording their hierarchical context seems like a good thing
to do.  (You could break the hierarchy in weird ways if you really
wanted to, by going around in circles or whatever; this would be
problematic for traditional hardcopy output if the pieces weren't
nested in the original source.)

I do wonder, however, why every last piece of a document needs to be
made accessible separately.  Not everything can be written modularly
down to the last paragraph, and sometimes subtrees should simply travel
together.  In the terms of Bob's example, why was that fictitious
section at level 3?  Would it make any sense if someone were to read it
without reading all the levels above?  If not, either it shouldn't be
accessible all by itself or it should be rewritten to be in less need
of its context.

I don't think every last piece does need to be made
accessible separately. You are right, not everything can be
written in a modular fashion. It requires a conscious
design on the part of the author.  The author must know
what levels will define topics and provide context where
necessary. For that reason, it cannot be done automatically
by, say, a server.  Many topics could have subsections
contained in them.  In that particular example, the
document is large and deep enough so that the <S3> could
stand alone, and it might contain <S4> section within the
file. Shorter documents might only make sense chunked at
the <S2> level.

All I was asking for is author *control* over how the
hierarchy gets broken up and reassembled.

Subject: SGML/HTML (long)
Status: RO

Something I've been giving a lot of thought to recently is the issue
``is HTML a presentation or a semantic encoding'', and one justifiable
view is that if you want semantic encoding you should be writing in
another DTD that represents the semantics you want (DocBook, ManPage,
Memo, HypertextThingie) and translating it to a presentation language
for presentation.

This is because HTML can no way, no how, encode all the semantics that
Real Live Authors want.  The whole point of SGML is that you can
encode all the semantics you want, and leave presentation as a later
translation.  To force the author into the very limited semantics
provided by HTML (headings, lists, emphasis, paragraphs) is to render
useless the enormous amount of effort that has gone into designing the
various DTDs.  I guess that hypertext links would have to be regarded
as common to all the DTDs, to provide hypertextishness.

This is one extreme.  The other extreme is to regard it as a semantics
only encoding, in which case it is going to have to be a bloody big

Please don't argue for placing annotations on the basis
of offsets.  Someone recently pointed out (and out and out,
given the current condition of www-talk!) that as long as
we're in SGML we ought to use anchors (real anchors, not
the HTML element called Anchor) to place annotations.  If
the annotated object has an ID already, that will do
instead of an anchor.  HTMLplus has the Note element
precisely to provide anchors for annotations.

Now, can anyone see problems with using anchors across 
versions?

At the risk of flooding the net simply by sending a new msg to
www-talk tonight...

The way you (we) want to think of annotations is this: they're virtual
document modifications that may exist on any of several levels: fully
public but not physically attached to the document, fully public and
physically attached to the document [ecccch, I hope nobody actually
implements these], limited to a given subgroup of people, limited to
those who have expressed interest in the opinions of the annotator,
personal, etc.

This means the document author should not a priori be able to
"restrict" or "enhance" the capability of people to add annotations
that are not physically part of her document.  That is, you at
O'Reilly should not be able to affect how I at NCSA can add an
annotation to your document that can only be viewed by others at NCSA
-- and vice versa.  As long as the annotation isn't actually,
physically affecting your document, you shouldn't care what I do with
the annotation.  (Concomitantly, browsers should provide user
interfaces sufficiently well-designed to make it clear what's really
part of the document and what's an annotation added by some yoyo at
NCSA.)

With some of the annotation systems we are talking about, we will be
dealing with the problems of scale (thousands of annotations) you
mention: those systems are the public systems [actually, "public"
annotations maintained by the same server storing the document itself
and "global" annotations distributed through a global Usenet-style
network of communicating servers, in my current taxonomy].  

There are and will be other annotation systems, or levels, (e.g. the
ones that exist today -- personal and workgroup) where the scale issue
will not be a problem, as very few people (and therefore relatively
few annotations) will be involved and you will a priori (there's that
term again) care about the opinions of those leaving the annotations
(else you could not (a) be yourself or (b) have that group's
annotation server on your list of annotation servers).

Further, mechanisms like kill files, and in the future more
sophisticated mechanisms (c.f. the collaborative filtering work going
on at Xerox PARC -- there was an interesting paper in CACM a while ago
-- basically, you say to the system one way or another "I respect
Bill's opinion but not Joe's" and the system gives you Bill's
annotations but not Joe's), will let you weed out the good stuff from
the bad stuff.

So I don't think we have to worry about "too many annotations".
You'll always just be able to disregard/ignore the ones you don't want
to see, since they will practically never be physically attached to
the documents themselves and the act of fetching and displaying them
will always be a value-add your browser will perform only if you want
it too (I myself would probably never have my browser display any
fully public annotations, etc.)

If we implement a system where a user can place an annotation in the
middle of this paragraph but not in the middle of *this* paragraph, or
at the end of this section but only at the beginning of *this*
section, etc. -- which is what will happen if annotation locations are
tracked solely by the preexisting names/anchors/id's in the document
-- users will be seriously confused and turned off.  I have nightmares
about 300 email messages a day from neophyte users saying "You have a
bug in Mosaic -- I can't place annotations where I want, except in
these three cases...."

OK, www-talk mail robot, do your worst...

Here is a rough draft of a proposal for various MIME type information
to be used with HTTP.  Any comments?  Hopefully from someone that knows
the MIME standard pretty well and point out conflits (though some are
intentional where I think MIME is broken).

Here are a couple of examples of what it would look like:

Request:
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85

Complex return type:
  Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar"; encoding="compress, uuencode"




<HEAD>
<TITLE>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal (rough draft)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>HTTP/1.0 MIME and Client Profile Proposal</H1>

Here are my proposed values for various types of data.  The Client
profile information is data the client can send along with the Accept:
field so the server can better choose the return data type.
For example:
<PRE>
  Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8;
          width=1024; height=768; xdpi=85; ydpi=85
</PRE>

With this additional information the server can try to make better choices
about the data it returns like the Aspect Ratio, image size, color or B&W,
etc. <P>

Types marked with a `*' are standard MIME types: <P>

Ick!  Annotations are entirely user-based, and this author-provision
stuff seems irrelevant.

*ahem*.  Here is a section from ``The Day the Universe Changed'' by
James Burke, on the formation of modern law.  It shows how annotations
were used originally, and still are today.  When I go to annotate
something, I usually annotate only a part of the document (something
tricky, something wrong or the crucial step in reasoning) rather than
the whole thing.

   Law had always been part of the training in the trivium, whose rhetoric
   course was subdivided into demonstrative, deliberative and judicial
   argument.  The `judicial' part had been taught in Pavia and in Ravenna,
   the ancient capital of the Byzantine Viceroy, as well as in Rome
   itself.  The major difficulty was that the material was piecemeal.  The
   great compendium of Roman law created by the Emperor Justinian and
   known as the Corpus Juris Civilis (Body of Civil Laws) had been lost
   since 603.  There had also been a key to the laws, the Digest, which
   contained a summary of all the main points.  Only two copies of the
   Digest had survived, and their whereabouts were unknown.

   Then, in 1076, a liberal arts teacher called Irnerius found a copy of
   the Digest, most probably in the library of the Royal Law School in
   Ravenna, close to Bologna where he lived.  The discovery of the Digest
   and the subsequent use which Irnerius and his successors made of it was
   of major importance in Western European history, because it put all
   Roman law into the hands of both the Church and the citizen. While this
   fact alone was to have far-reaching effects on the development of the
   West in economic and political terms, what was to have even greater
   impact was the way in which the Digest was edited.

   The Digest was extremely complex and difficult to understand, often
   referring to situations and concepts of which the medieval European
   lawyer was only dimly aware.  It was immensely sophisticated, compiled
   and refined as it had been through the centuries from early Rome until
   Justinian's time to serve the greatest empire in the world.  It was a
   system which those with the limited experience of the early Middle Ages
   could not easily comprehend.  Irnerius made the Digest easier to use by
   `glossing' it.  Glossing was a technique already in use which involved
   the addition of notes, analyses and commentaries to the margin of a
   manuscript.  These glosses were generally used as lecture notes by
   teachers interpreting the text for their students.

   At the monastery of St Stephen, Irnerius expounded his system.  The aim
   was to elucidate the literal meaning of every sentence and to give
   coherence to the subject-matter as a whole.  As an aid to the
   understanding of each sentence in the text, he advised that the teacher
   should provide synonyms for difficult words, add notes to clarify an
   obscure sentence structure, and explain any unfamiliar custom to which
   the text referred.  Teachers were also to prepare summulae (notes
   summing up whole areas of law), continuationes(summaries of different
   groups of laws) and distinctiones (variations on the hypothetical cases
   described).

   The novelty of this approach cannot be overestimated.  At the time, all
   over Europe, ``going to the law'' still meant visiting a priest who
   would pray for signs and give what advice he could.  It might often
   involve the ordeal of trial by fire, or by tying up suspected persons
   and throwing them into a river; if they drowned, they had been
   innocent.  Much legal decision-making was left to astrologers, who
   would judge right or wrong according to the accused man's date of
   birth.  To approach the matter of jurisprudence in a rational and
   analytical way was a tremendous step forward.

Surely removing annotations from their source is (a) asking for
confusion and (b) a bit silly 'cos if annotations refer to a specific
part of the text then putting them elsewhere is contrary to the
intentions of the author of the annotation.

I envision a system like Usenet news, but with no expiry (deletion is
by request only).  Threading is essential in this case.

I strongly endorse Ed's proposed setup. (Minor quibble -- would
'developer' be more descriptive than 'programmer'? Even if so, if
'programmer' is the convention elsewhere, that's the way to go.)

A moderated Announce group would be tremendously helpful, especially if
it were archived somewhere. And of course Nat's FAQ would be appropriate
for periodical announcement or posting.

In "marketing" WWW, it's important that information be accessible to
*folks who are not yet on the Web*. I've suggested to TimBL
that CERN run a tiny Gopher for this purpose, with perhaps a single
descriptive document, a Telnet Lynx session, and a GIF screen image from
Mosaic. This newsgroup layout would be similarly accessible to the
masses who haven't yet seen the Web, while splitting off the voluminous
developer dialogue.

As long as it's a valid PostScript file (according to the Adobe
specs), Ghostview/Ghostscript should be able to display it.

That's correct for the default case (for Mosaic 1.2).  However, the
latest ghostview is fixed so eventually we'll be switching back.  For
now, all you have to do is set:

XMosaic*postscriptViewerCommand: ghostview

....to get the previous behavior from Mosaic.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Cheers,
Marc

Sort of, for collaborative authoring, but...

The right way to do this is simply edit the document and submit it back
to the server using PUT.  The server can then do the right thing with it
(maybe check in the changes if you have authorization, or include a <LINK>
to the changes so the author can then click on his "merge delta" button
and ok the changes before commiting them, or insert a tag and point an
annotation at it).

Suggestion for new link relationship: <LINK REL="Delta" HREF="...">
Points to a Delta file that the browser can use to merge in changes.

Since CERN is a VM site, one perfectly viable option would be to
use Revised Listserv on CERNVM.  I realize such a suggestion
is probably anathema to this crowd, but Listserv is a mature product
that provides automated archives and fast searching of said archives
(although the search language is admittedly somewhat baroque).

Another option would be Unix Listprocessor (nee Unix Listserv) by
Anastasios Kotsikonas (tasos@cs-mail.bu.edu) which I believe is
available at no chage.

BTW, to the list -- I see once again we're getting multiple
(apparently three) copies of every note to be sent to www-talk.  This
is starting to get surreal -- Tim, can you install a working mail
exploder for www-talk?  Otherwise, we may as well just all move to
Usenet where things are known to work...

Subject: Anno., SGML, granularity
Status: RO

Sorry, folks, I wasn't thinking when I rejected out of hand
the notion of offsets for storing the position of annotations
outside of a file.  But this seems like a rat's nest anyway.
Let me suggest instead that the positioning of annotations be
made at the granularity provided by the document's IDs.

That means you wouldn't be able to insert an annotation at 
any point in a paragraph (do we really need to be able to
do that?  is anyone using annotations this way for good 
reason?), and recalcitrant authors could make the granularity
of possible annotations very coarse by omitting IDs.  But
annotations would clump naturally, instead of being spread
through the document like a mist, and that might be useful.
And someone who wanted to encourage annotations could just
provide lots of IDs.

More generally, on annotations:  how can this possibly work
at a large scale?  If I have a document that the world can
annotate, and it's controversial, I could generate hundreds
of thousands of annotations (think of the number of calls to
the White House when something big is in the news).  No one
can sensibly sort through such a heap.  How do Webbers really
envision annotations working in practice?

Subject: Annotations and SGML structure
Status: RO

There are two issues here:
 --- placing annotations precisely
and
 --- differentiating between versions

Something like the following seems workable:

	The document is fetched by the client, who checks whether the
	document has annotations by asking the annotation server for
	the headers of the annotations of this URL.  The signatures
	of the current document and the signatures kept in the headers
	are compared, and the current annotations are added to the
	document (as links or as marginal notes or ...).  If there are
	out-of-date annotations, they appear as a message saying
	``this document had the following annotations on a previous
	version'' and the titles/authors/whatever appear as a <MENU>
	and are selectable.

The placement of annotations can be done on a byte-offset basis,
because the accuracy needs to be pin-point for the current document
and is ignored for previous versions.

Fortunately this not an issue of opinion, since SGML DTDs define the
structure of document instance parsetrees unambigously (provided, of
course, that DTD was designed properly).

Excerpting from the current HTML DTD:

      <!ENTITY % heading "H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6" >
      <!ENTITY % bodyelement
	       "P | A | %heading |
	       %list | DL | HEADERS | ADDRESS | PRE | BLOCKQUOTE
	      | %literal">
      <!ENTITY % inline "EM | TT | STRONG | B | I | U |
			      CODE | SAMP | KBD | KEY | VAR | DFN | CITE "
	      >
      <!ENTITY % text "#PCDATA | IMG | %inline;">
      <!ELEMENT BODY - -  (%bodyelement|%text;)*>
      <!ELEMENT ( %heading )  - -  (%text;|A)+>

H1 elements can only contain one or more A elements or the elements
allowed by %text;. If anyone thinks of it of being any more than that,
they are in error.

Reading this list I sometimes worry that some people think that most
of the issues are matters of opinion when really they are not. 

WWW allegedly uses SGML. However, when I read the HMTL+ spec [HTML+
(Hypertext Markup Language) by Dave Raggett, my version is dated 12
July], I sometimes wonder if it is really SGML you are talking about,
or just some lookalike clone. I quote:

	"Please ensure that browsers can tolerate bad markup. In
	 practice, this is straightforward to achieve, provided that a
	 naive top-down SGML parser is avoided. A forgiving parser
	 should be able to cope with tags in unexpected positions,
	 e.g. the <A> tag bracketing a header [footnote omitted].
	 Unknown tags should simply be ignored."

				    HTML+ spec, p. 4

SGML was specifically designed to make SGML document instances LL(1)
parsable. This also makes them top-down parsable. Of course I can
interpret the above statement as "naive top-down parsers exist", but I
rather read it as "top-down parsers are naive", which is non-sense
when you're dealing with LL(1) grammars.

However, the real problem is that the authors are telling us that we
are not really dealing with documents that are parsable according to a
grammar that is known in advance. At any time we can encounter
"unknown tags" or "bad markup".


One of the great things about real, hard science (math, physics, ...)
is that you can use other people's work (proofs, results) in your
own. Likewise, one of the major benefits of using SGML is that you can
use publically available parsers (eg. ARCSGML, SGMLS) to parse
document instances instead of writing a parser yourself. In computing,
people reinvent the wheel all the time, which is a waste of time.  In
this particular case the HTML+ spec forces people to reinvent the
wheel by writing parsers over and over.

Of course I realize that the quoted statement is intended to make the
information providers lives easier, but the real solution for that
problem is to give providers tools that will let write and translate
their stuff to a proper, unambigous format; the solution is not
letting them "do what they want" with regard to tagging.

Tolerating bad markup will create endless problems in the long
run. The way HTML+ is formulated, there is no way to tell if a
document is HTML+ compliant or not.

Was this issue discussed at W^5? Comments, anyone?

I would just like to second Klaus' remarks.

Almost SGML is not good enough.  It is not just a problem of not being 
able to use any public domain SGML tools but I would have thought that 
it will *increase* the effort required to develop HTML(+) applications.

As the number of applications increase, every developer needs to be aware 
of the plethora of quirks that are supported by other applications in 
order to fit in.

Surely requiring parseable documents is good for authors who have the 
assurance that their document can be understood by all applications, good 
for developers in having a clear requirement to develop to, and good for 
end users who should have a greater choice of applications to use.

Regards,

Steve. (Your man on the ground)

I see I didn't make myself clear enough :(.  I meant that people seem
to be under the impression that 
	<H1>globglob</H1>
	textytexty
	<H1>globglobglobglobglob</H1>
is in some sense a definition of a semantic region that lies between
the </H1> and the next <H1> tags and thus that headings are semantic
rather than presentation tags.  I would classify this sort of heading
as being a presentation-mainly quasi-semantic tag.  If a region has a
heading associated with it, it should be defined as a region ie
	<REGION><H1>heading1</H1>
	text of the region
	</REGION><REGION><H1>next heading</H1>
	...

This means that the <H> tags have presentation only value under the
current DTD, and therefore they should be allowed (as I said) wherever
paragraphs are, as well as between items in a list.

Darn true!  The short-term solution of saying ``oh well, crappy markup
should be tolerated so the iddle widdle authors don't get brain
strain'' leads to automated software tools (which, despite my prior
rantings to the contrary, are still vital) not being useful because
they can't extract the semantics from crappily-marked-up documents.

The HTML+ model *will* be fast to display - the first pass is only needed
once, when the browser first retrieves the document. Subsequently, the table
can be displayed efficiently using information cached from the first pass.
I will knock some code together to show how this is done in the near future!

Remember that browsers are forced to parse the document once anyway in order
to size scrollbars. The additional cost of tables will be quite small.

Gosh, its a shame I couldn't get to the workshop.

I think I know what you mean. 

HOWEVER, I my view (as I think I've stated before, only then with
regard to P elements) HTML ought to be redesigned to have richer
structure, ie. using containers much more.  The present HTML DTD makes
document instances flat, being mostly a sequence of elements.

Having
	<!ENTITY % h1contents	(h1title,(A|P|H2|%text;|....)+)> 
		<!-- this sketch only serves to demonstrate
		     that H2 elements would nest in H1 elements. -->

or possibly
	
	<!ENTITY % h1contents	(title,(A|P|H2|%text;|....)+)> 
		<!-- with a generic title element -->

would change your Nathan's suggestion

> 	<REGION><H1>heading1</H1>
> 	text of the region
> 	</REGION><REGION><H1>next heading</H1>

into

> 	<H1><H1TITLE>heading1</H1TITLE>
> 	text of the region
> 	</H1>

which is much nicer, which - again - illustrates the desirability of
using container rather than sequencing everything.

Going over this mail, I realize that I agree with the people that
Nathan mentioned in the mail I followed up to: That H1 *should*
"define a region", it is the present DTD that is wrong on this point.

  -- This does not change the fact that you cannot misinterpret the
current DTD on this point.

Character offsets work rather better when from nearby markup, e.g.
from the preceding header or paragraph mark. For this to work such
elements should include an ID attribute for the offset to reference.

Another complimentary scheme is to use pattern matching - The annotation
acts like an antibody which only sticks to the right part of the document.
By specifying the pattern redundantly, the glue continues to work even if
a few changes have been made to the document since the pattern was defined.

Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to refine this idea. Anybody
interested in taking it further?

Subject: semantics of <Hn>
Status: RO

Thanks to the gentleman for Euromath for suggesting HTML+ adopt what is
almost exactly the TEI approach to the general question of sectioning
documents. Simplifying wildly, a TEI document has the following
structure:

<!ELEMENT text - - (front?, body, back?) >

<!ELEMENT (front,body,back) - o (div+) >

<!ELEMENT div  - o (head*, (%component.seq | div) )>

There are lots of wrinkles, but that's the basic notion. Read the
chapter on Default Text Structure (DS) for details. You'll see from the
above that this allows
(a) identifiable chunks ("divs") at any depth of nesting
(b) headings whose semantics are derived from their context (a "head"
inside a div at level n is not the same as one inside a div at level
n+1)
(c) modularization -- the definition of %component.seq is dependent on
the way in which the dtd has been assembled. Some documents are not
composed of paragraphs, for example. 

And three loud cheers also for those expressing the view that
non-verifiable SGML  does not exist. It *is* possible to write a dtd
capable of handling very large classes of documents without
compromising either the requirement of formal verifiability or the
requirement of usability.

I nearly agree with this, but have two reservations. 

(1)  H1s  are so frequently interpreted as being synonymous with
<region1><h1> ... (as Nat points out) that it's asking for trouble not to
constrain their position a bit more.

(2) One dtd I've been using has two different kinds of heading tag -- a
<head> which can appear *only* at the start of a region, and a <caption>
which can appear anywhere else, but doesn't start a new region. 

The trouble is that it's heard to see how you would tag something as a
heading without there being something following which it is the heading
of - and which therefore is a region.

The only cases I know of are the "pull quotes" which appear typically in
magazines (where you have a sentence or so in big letters splashed down
in the middle of a paragraph to catch your eye) and -- less
persuasively--very low level  newspaper captions where it's just too
much time and trouble to mark every paragraph as a region.

Yep, floating heads do exist in documents other than magazines.

This is exactly what we've implemented in our DTD for software
documentation (we got the idea from Bull, which submitted its
"in-between title" idea to OSF for its consideration).  We now have a
"bridging title" whose purpose is to help the reader navigate the
discussion once he/she has located it, but which is not meant to label
just the following "region" -- rather, it often bridges the previous
and following discussions.

It does create sort of a phantom region in the mind's eye, and we
realize the idea is tainted with a bit of presentation specificity, but
it buys us certainty that the entire discussion won't be broken up into
tiny little (useless, incomplete) topics in our online book viewer.
We've found the concept to be pretty useful, seems intuitive for
writers to apply, and is a good alternative in places where you want to
*structure* information, just not strongly *hierarchically*.  (Clear as
mud? :-) I believe it's been picked up by several of the organizations
who were involved in the OSF conversations.

You can gunzip a zip archive if it has a single element.  But you are
correct, it's an archive format, not an encoding.  I will fix that.

So it's now:

 archive/zip                    zip             zip Compressed

Thanks for pointing that out.

I always suspected there might be a problem with the WWW paradigm
regarding security; specifically, what if one of the protocols is
general enough that commands specified in it could be legal for some
other protocol?

This concern is no longer academic.  Check out the document 

	http://cs.indiana.edu/security-demo.html

for a pointer to a document I consider somewhat dangerous.  I only
know that this security hole will work in Xmosaic; haven't tested
other browsers but it seems reasonable to assume any browser with the
standard lib is vulnerable.

What does it do?  It uses the gopher: scheme to cause your client to
attach to your local SMTP server and send a mail message to "root" on
your machine.  The message is innocent but in principle it could be to
anyone and say anyone, and it would be tracable to you (depending what
kind of security logging your system does.)

A few questions:

- Is plain gopher sans WWW vulnerable to this same problem?  Do they
  know about it?  If not, telling them (and also CERT) would be a good idea.

- How do we fix this?  (Just throwing in a minor patch for this
  particular attack is no good; we need a general solution for making
  sure that a gopher: URL actually points to a gopher server.)

WWW should be a safe place, where I can just point a beginner and have
him wander around.  This needs to be fixed, fast.

I agree with Nathan that HTML cannot be all things to all
people for semantic encoding. The AAP DTD tried to do that
and turned into a monster. I would hate to see WWW get
bogged down with a huge DTD that intimidates new authors
and makes performance a problem.

SCO does not plan to directly author in HTML. We view it as
a presentation form, and will code our source files with a
rich DTD like DocBook that is appropriate for our software
business.  From that source we can derive Postscript for
hardcopy and HTML for online delivery.  I'm not saying that
everyone must operate this way, but I'll bet we aren't
alone.  I'll also bet most of the information that goes
into WWW was authored in some other form and was converted
to HTML.  

I believe maintaining SGML structure online is important,
but more for delivery than for authoring purposes.
The design should consider how users will want to manipulate
the information using the structural information.

At the most recent Davenport meeting, Hewlett Packard
presented their proposal for a Semantic Delivery Language
(SDL), which is an information delivery DTD.  They gave up
trying to get all the HP units to author with the same
tools, and designed a common SGML format for online
delivery. By creating filters from the commonly used
authoring formats to SDL, they will be able to merge
information from a variety of sources. That is very similar
to what WWW is trying to do.

That was the idea.

I don't care what you do with HTML+ but don't go changing HTML, we
agreed at WWWWW what the final HTML RFC would have (which I outlined
in my notes).  HTML is frozen for all time.  We should be spending our
efforts on HTML+.

I've just verified this myself.  Oops!!

Idea:

How about patching clients so they have a list of "dodgy ports",
like SMTP, and ask the user whether to carry on if they get given
a URL that points to one?

Here are my notes from the authoring tools discussion.  We
didn't really develop a features list. In the short time we
had, we mostly discussed what was out there and why there
wasn't more.

Authoring tools
---------------
I led this subgroup in the hope that someone would
offer their whizbang WYSIWYG HTML editor.  No luck.

- Only the NeXT box has a graphical editor, and it won't work
  with HTML+ because of element nesting.

- tkWWW is an HTML editor, but has a bad interface and is
  hard to use.  User's said vi was quicker.

- gnu emacs has an HTML editing add-on that many recommended,
  but it isn't graphical.

- Many companies keep doc in another format
  and need general conversion tools.  I mentioned
  ICA toolkit as a possibility, but the general
  experience confirms it isn't quite ready for SGML.

- SoftQuad, Arbortext, and Frame offer tools that could
  be used for authoring, but there is a need for a cheap
  and simple HTML editor.

- Word Perfect and Intellitag could work, but no one
  has experience with it.

- Word for Windows could be used with a set of HTML styles
  and use an RTF-HTML filter, but Word doesn't support
  nesting context.

- The Xmosaic display widget writer was there, and he tried
  to do an editible version.  The main barrier seems to be
  editing structured documents.  It is hard to define a good
  WYSIWYG interface for that because users aren't used to
  structure, and visual cues to indicate what element the
  cursor is in are important (but break the WYSIWYG).

- NCSA said they could add editing at a high cost, and
  no one offered to pay.

- Fantasy: one of the SGML editor vendors releases a
  cheap crippled version of their product for HTML.

Hm.. we are currently working on a WYSIWYG HTML editor (with a "drag and
drop" interface for HTML elements). I'll elaborate more on the UI aspects
as soon as we got something to show. In the meantime, could somebody 

be a bit more specific on the problems connected to element nesting? 

It might be very helpful if we could also take into consideration
what other people think on this subject.

Please e-mail if you think it's not of general interest to this list.

Thanx a bunch,

Well, there's no way you can tell that a URL points to a gopher server
(or a HTTP server or an FTP server or an NNTP server).  Unless you
restrict gopher URLs to port 70, HTTP to port 80, etc.

Gopher is less vulnerable to this problem since you'll only be able to
convice it to send a single line to an arbitrary port.

You can avoid most of the problem by not letting the browsers translate
% escapes into newlines and carriage returns.  That won't restrict
your access to gopherspace.  While you're at it you may as well not
translate %09 into tab.  The change to xmosaic 1.2 is trivial: hack
de_escape() in HTGopher.c.  It is equally easy (the same?) for libwww2.

The gopher URL will still let you send almost any single line of text
to any port on any machine, but you have to allow that if you want
to talk gopher.  The lack of translation on HTTP URLs limits the
danger, but you can almost get away with

<A HREF="/garbage
MAIL FROM: <gopher-user>
and so on
">mail it</A>

Certainly something to be careful of.  This problem could exist for FTP
and other protocols, but they don't do translation of funny characters.
This is a bug and when that bug is fixed they'll also have to be careful
of CR and LF sneaking in there.

	I always suspected there might be a problem with the WWW paradigm

===========================================================================
CA-93:11                        CERT Advisory
                                August 9, 1993
                  UMN UNIX gopher and gopher+ Vulnerabilities

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning
vulnerabilities in versions of the UMN UNIX gopher and gopher+ server and
client available before August 6, 1993.  Vulnerable versions were available on
boombox.micro.umn.edu:/pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12s.tar.Z,
boombox.micro.umn.edu:/pub/gopher/Unix/gopher2.03.tar.Z, and many other
anonymous FTP sites mirroring these software versions.

We strongly recommend that any site using versions of UMN UNIX gopher
and gopher+ dated prior to August 6, 1993 (including version 1.12, 1.12s,
2.0+, 2.03, and all earlier versions) immediately take corrective action.

If you have further questions regarding UMN UNIX gopher or gopher+ software, 
send e-mail to: gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     Several vulnerabilities have been identified in UMN UNIX gopher and 
     gopher+ when configured as a server or public access client.
 
     Intruders are known to have exploited these vulnerabilities to obtain 
     password files.  Other actions may also have been taken by intruders
     exploiting these vulnerabilities.  CERT has already contacted those
     sites currently known to have been victims of these activities. However, 
     sites may want to check for weak passwords, or consider changing 
     passwords, after installing the new gopher software.

II.  Impact

     Anyone (remote or local) can potentially gain unrestricted access 
     to the account running the public access client, thereby permitting 
     them to read any files accessible to this account (possibly including 
     /etc/passwd or other sensitive files).

     In certain configurations, anyone (remote or local) can potentially
     gain access to any account, including root, on a host configured as a
     server running gopherd.
 
III. Solution 

     Affected sites should consider disabling gopherd service and public gopher
     logins until they have installed the new software.

     New versions of the UMN UNIX gopher and gopher+ software have been 
     released that provide bug fixes and correct these security problems.  
     Sites can obtain these new versions via anonymous FTP from 
     boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2). The files are located in:

     Filename                                Size     Checksum
     --------                                ------   -----------
     Gopher:
     /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12S.tar.Z      306872   46311   300
     Gopher+:
     /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher2.04.tar.Z       294872   29411   288

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CERT Coordination Center wishes to thank Matt Schroth, Williams College, 
and others for informing us of these vulnerabilities.  We would also like to 
thank Paul Lindner, University of Minnesota, for his quick response to these 
problems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact the CERT
Coordination Center or your representative in FIRST (Forum of Incident
Response and Security Teams).

	- How do we fix this?  (Just throwing in a minor patch for this
	  particular attack is no good; we need a general solution for making
	  sure that a gopher: URL actually points to a gopher server.)
	
	WWW should be a safe place, where I can just point a beginner and have
	him wander around.  This needs to be fixed, fast.

What I'm more concerned with now is your comments on the insecurity of WWW
itself.  If this is clearly true, we will have to immediately pull it off all our machines
here (which we'll need to do if there isn't a "comfortable" answer to this...).
Once this is done, I suspect we'll never be able to put mosaic back.
I'm sure everyone across the board in corporate settings will have to do so also, so
let's see if we can resolve this QUICKLY and satisfactorily to keep WWW going strong. 

(and hopefully my message will even get to the dist list...)

I'm not sure I understand the problem.  Telnet will let you send a single
line of text to any port on any machine.  If if your telnet won't, it's
trivial to do it yourself with a few lines of C code (or perl, I guess)

Right.  But if you do it with telnet you know what you sent.  The Web
browser will do this on your behalf without you even knowing what
was sent.  Or even knowing that you sent it.

This looks like the only choice that's close to being "there".  Maybe the
UI problems can be addressed?

   Well, the point is that other people, who might not know they are
sending the mail, will send it automatically by retrieving this
document.  And they won't receive any notification that they did -
until mr Root comes knocking on his door.

   This came up when people were discussing the generic
telnet://host:port/somestring, but I guess nobody realized gopher
could be used to do the same thing.

   If someone has to go to all this trouble just to forge mail he
wants to send, he should be shot.  But the point is not for you to
send the mail, but for hundreds of people to uniwittingly send the
mail, and they can't say they didn't send it - THEY DID.

   Imagine if I put this in the home page for IU - we have received >
6000 requests since tuesday - that would have been quite a few
messages sent off to root, at the users machine.  Not a good
situation.

   I think the suggestion of checking the port # before doing a
request is a good idea.  Ones to watch would be 25(smtp), 119
(usenet), 110 (pop) - any others?

   I think I'll implement this in my emacs browser after my operating
systems test. :)

Let's face it folks, TCP/IP is unsafe.  We are not working with technology
which protects us from the wolves.  Anyone who is seriously concerned with
network security does not connect to the Internet. Period.

Ignoring the limitations of the underlying protocols for a moment, I have
said it before and I will say it again:

	We should not hobble our most important and powerful tools to
	compensate for the inadequacies of the legacy services on the
	net.  

	We can spoof sendmail.  Ok, fix sendmail and leave the tools
	alone.  I can use a sledgehammer to break into a house so 
	we make the possession of a sledgehammer a capital offence.  
	What utter nonsense!

	We can telnet to arbitrary ports using 'telnet.'  Ok, fix those
	services which run on those ports.  Crippling client software
	because the server is insecure is asinine.

	It's simply not our responsibility to restrict the first truly useful
	tools we have developed to manage the complexities of information
	navigation simply because the network has embraced hacks and 
	kludges instead of well developed services -- and if we take the tack 
	that it is, we swiftly become lost in thousands of twisty little 
	tunnels of paranoia, all alike.

	Mime and a few people's well intentioned but misguided efforts 
	notwithstanding.

Apologies to any offended, but this is a hot button with me.

You run Unix and TCP/IP on your systems, accept the security risks
therein, and yet think it's an crisis when it turns out that
WWW/Mosaic/Gopher/etc. are no more secure than all the rest of the
package?  Does that really make sense?

This is the clincher.  There can never be such a thing as a WYSIWYG
HTML editor, due to the nature of HTML.  The editor has to not only be
a structured text editor but has to make it clear to the user what's
going on in the structured text, and not let things break, but still
open up all the possibilities, without being more confusing than
simply writing HTML by hand.  This is not easy.  I'm not even sure if
it's possible.  I tried to come up with a GUI design for such an
editor and couldn't.

I think it's telling that lack of an editor hasn't been a showstopper
-- WWW is growing much faster than other network tools regardless.
(Yes, I agree an editor would be *useful*; that's not my point.)

I also think conversion tools will, in the long run, be more useful
than an editor.  Why?  Any editor produced in the WWW environment and
given away is simply not going to be able to compare with standard
commercial editors.  We are not Microsoft (none of us).  Also, HTML
does not make a good base document format; I find it hard to believe
that publishers, for example, are going to be using it as their base
format, ever.  A converter that capitalizes on a good preexisting
format (e.g. RTF) and delivers good HTML as an output format for
networked information distribution is much more useful in such cases.

As usual, my opinions only...

Actually, I was one of the people who complained about the tkWWW, but 
for whatever reason (maybe better libraries...?) it works great
now.  The editing is still quite kludgy, but the following
is from a message I received from Joe Wang a week back (hopefully
he doesn't mind my reproducing it...):

Real inlined images won't be available until around January, because it
will require some changes to the tk code itself.  Version 0.9 (coming out
in two weeks) will at least show the images as tags which are hyperlinked
to the images themselves.

If you like the editing capibilities of tkWWW 0.8, you'll love tkWWW 0.9.
Some contributors have combined tkWWW with the editor provided by jstools.

Fortunately, the above statement is not true.  If it were, or if it
becomes true in the future, the Internet will never be the tool that
its proponents envision it to be.  At least some people who worry use
things like firewalls, but firewalls don't defend against this
particular kind of vulnerability.

Of course, if word becomes widespread that WWW allows firewalls to be
bypassed and security weaknesses to be exploited, corporate sites
running firewalls will be unwilling to allow HTTP packets pass through
for their users.  This is why it's important to fix it quickly; we
have already heard from at least one large company who could get rid
of WWW if it's seen as insecure.

I can make no sense at all out of your analogy with prohibiting
sledgehammer possessions.  The problem is that it's possible for an
attacker to disguise your front door as a Wack-a-Mole game so that
people smash it in with sledgehammers without ever knowing they did
anything.  I don't think this is good.

With me as well. I don't think you understand the severity of this.  I
could, had I the desire, probably manipulate some much-viewed document
(say, the finger gateway image stuff) I could cause several thousand
people to send mail without knowing it.  If the recipient of said mail
was someone significant (a smart server would vary it depending on the
location of the request; say, the president or CEO or their
company/University/etc.) and the contents of such mail sufficiently
bad (say, brutal rape and death threats) it would not be difficult to
envision having accounts yanked, being fired or expelled, and the like
to happen to many people before the truth was discovered (if it ever
was; depends how clever I was about it.)

The real problem (IMHO) is that Gopher is so broad that it's possible
to simulte other protocol's commands within it.  SMTP is arguably
sub-optimal as well.  But denouncing these things as ugly hacks (which
is possibly true) does not relieve us of the responsibility to do what
is possible to create a safe WWW environment for people.

The modifications needed are not terribly dramatic; disallowing
crlfs to be sent to gopher clients would be a significant help.
Prohibiting connections to ports <1024 other than 70 would help more,
though it might lose some functionality.  Fixing this bug need not
entail crippling anything as you claim.  What's important is that the
whole problem, not just this particular manifestation, be fixed.

In general, safety is more important than functionality.  Period.
That's why we have speed limits on roads, and that's why we need this
fix.

Yes.  AT&T uses firewalls up the wazoo.  Having objects imported
through a firewall which cause network transactions specified by
someone outside the wall to be performed within it have the effect of
bypassing its protection, and thus involves a lot more risks than
plain old FTP/SMTP/NNTP/etc.

Pardon me if this is horribly ignorant, but couldn't the WWW browser make an
attempt to identify the service to which it has connected?

Let's take Gopher as an example. Upon initial connection, Gopher doesn't
identify itself upon with something like "Welcome to gopher at <host.domain>",
and in fact, it says nothing when you connect to it.  That makes it kind of
difficult to make a positive identification, but a WWW browser can expect
to _not_ get a message back saying something like:

220 <host.domain> Sendmail 5.64/3.14 ready at <date>

or

200 <host.domain> news server ready - posting ok

Any unexpected messages like these should cause the browser to have second
thoughts about continuing the connection.  I haven't looked at every
service, but most seem have been modelled after the command/response
mechanism used in ftp and smtp, and they identify themselves upon initial
connection.

Admittedly, it is a real pain for a browser to validate services, but
it could skip validation if the connection was being made to the port which 
is normally associated with the service (e.g. 70 for Gopher).

Comments?

100% in agreement...  We need more filters like the latex2html filter 
(almost good enough to convince me to learn latex).

Unfortunately, you're mechanism of alerting people to the problem may
in fact cause this message to spread.  We were aware of the CERT 
security bulletin (which didn't explain the problem, possibly
for secuity reasons).  A graphic example of the problem, which
you've put up, may have unintentionally caused more harm than good.
Instead of following the route of alerting Marc and other developers to the
problem and fixing it before word got out, we now have a situation
where we have known insecure clients (luckily word hasn't gone out
to the usenet list).   A CERT bulletin is around the corner - we're 
already patching as fast and as best we can, but ...

No.  SMTP does exactly what it purports to do; it provides host-level
authentication (i.e. if someone SMTPs to my site, I can know what
address the connection came from.)  While it's possible to compromise
this in some cases by impersonating hosts or damaging routers, it
certainly isn't the kind of attack that any high school geek with a
modem could perpetrate.

What WWW (and also Gopher) offers is something without precedent a few
years ago; a very general ability to pass around objects which, when
received, cause someone else to perform a particular network
transaction without being specifically aware of doing so, potentially
turning clients into gateways.  Is it so surprising that there are new
security concerns?  I'm amazed (and pleased) there have been so few
problems.

Don't take this wrong (i.e., from the tone of the last two messages), but what
about MIME??!  The MIME/ghostview security hole was potentially much more devastating than
the one you've uncovered for many reasons.  From your analysis, I would say that we should
throw out MIME...

I'm not offended but I do think this misses the point.  It's fine that
you can hack into sendmail.  If you do it's traceable to you.  The problem
is using current WWW software *someone* else can send offensive data and
it looks like it came from you and you have no way to prove that it didn't
(othen than one should never trust email, PGP makes it a little better).

BTW: Technically this isn't a security hole, it doesn't allow anyone
access to anything they couldn't already access.  If you care about
tracing the info then you can add security logging to find out where
these things are coming from.

How about we start disallowing Gopher connections to anything other
than 70 and 71 (some Gopher servers use the latter), HTTP connections
to anything other than 80, Z39.50 and 210, and NNTP connections to
anything other than (whatever the NNTP port is), etc. -- except for
>1024, which is wide open.

Is that sufficient to make AT&T and MvH happy?  Does it cause any
impact on *current* functionality?

Is it also necessary to prohibit escaping of cr/lf?

I found out something interesting today.  If there are two links
in a document with the same name.
i.e.
<A name=3 href="whatever">foo</a>  and
<A name=3 href="different_whatever">bar</a>

the WWW library will give the second link the same href as the previous one.

This has caused a bit of confusion to say the least.  When you select the
second one you get the first one's data instead!

A good example of this is in the Mosaic multimedia demo:
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/mosaic-docs/multimedia.html
(look for name=8, and name=9)

Now for the question.  Should we fix this (like mosaic has) and let users
write hororific HTML which will confuse them to no end when they try
to modify and maintain it?  Or should we not fix it, so that users
can figure out that they have a problem????

:lou

Oh! BTW I've got a pre-release version of Lynx 2.0.11 about ready to go.
    You can pick it up at aixtest.cc.ukans.edu in the /pub directory.

    You can demo it out by telnet'ing to kufacts.cc.ukans.edu, login
    as 'www' and select "about lynx".  There you will find a link
    to a demo session of lynx 2.0.11. (nothing fancy)

    The following changes have been made.

Many style changes have been made to make HTML rendering
more closely resemble XMosaic.

* Added Nested Lists, up to six levels, with different bullets
  for each level.

* Due to the fact that nearly everyone seems to use <p> to mean
  two returns within the same style, and Mosaic has been kind
  enough to support this meaning, :( :( :(  I have changed
  the <p> tag to reflect this interpretation.  <p> can be used
  anywhere and will mean insert two returns.  (i.e. two <br> tags)

* Made the default Mime type for unknown file types on ftp servers
  to be text/plain.  Previously the WWWLibrary had the default
  as application/octet-stream which meant that most files could not
  be viewed.

* Changed the ADDRESS style to be more like XMosaic
  Left flush, newline top and bottom

* The Statusline now displays the URL when retrieving files.

* added BR (linebreak) tag!

* added HR (horizontal rule tag!

* All spaces, tabs and returns are now collapsed down do one
  space.

* fixed bug whiched caused certain links beginning at the
  begining of a line to be bad.

* added '*' (stars) to unordered lists and numbers to ordered
  lists.

* changed dir lists to be more like menu lists.

* all emphasis, physical and symantic, now have _underlines_
  around them to show emphasis.

http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gnat/converters.html
is a controversial wee document about where I think WWW markup should
be going.

In addition,

http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gnat/converters/dante.sgml
is an SGML-marked up copy of the first Canto from Dante's ``Hell''
(with annotations).  The DTD is inlined.

http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gnat/converters/dante.html
is the output of a conversion program run on dante.sgml to convert the
dante DTD to HTML.

http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gnat/converters/dante2html
is the perl script that did the conversion --- it is based on the
sgmls.p script that came with sgmls (a groovy and much-recommended
package).

Feedback welcomed, either as annotations (I have a local annotation
server running on www.vuw.ac.nz:8002) or e-mail or www-talk messages.

tkWWW 0.9 will have a slightly improved editing system, but admitted

Limiting HTTP connections to only a few ports will cause problems for a number
of servers.  There are HTTP servers running on a wide range of ports including
many on ports 8000, 8001, and 8002, and many on other unpredictable ports
(2784, 800, 9666, etc).  In particular this would influence sites like 
info.cern.ch which has servers running on ports 80, 2784, 8001, 8002 and 
8004, where they can't simply move to the 'standard' port because they are 
already using it.

If one really must limit what ports someone connects to (I don't think think
it should be limited) then it would probably be better to have a list of
'dangerous/insecure ports' like 25 that it won't connect to.

That's why my original note said "except for >1024, which is wide

This would never happen, a simple grep through the users files would find
the offensive data in the .mosaic-global-history file and from there it
wouldn't take a genius to figure out the rest.  The site serving the
offending data would probably have their net connection yanked in short
order until things could be sorted out.

This is a good reason for browsers to keep good log files of what they do.

Also, the big problem is the behind the users back aspect of <IMG>
retrieval.  At least, with normal links the user can see the URL
before clicking on it.  So paranoids might want to have browsers that
let them verify non-standard requests on these.

I agree that this should be fixed.  For gopher it seems reasonable to
limit access to only ports 70 and >1024.  Sites that use ports <1024 that
aren't port 70 are broken.  As far as I know there is only one that matters:
doppler.ncsc.org:71, big deal (allow 70 and 71 if you want).  nic.ddn.mil:43
is the other and it's just a goophy gopher/whois port, all the information
is via the whois protocol, the gopher part is just fluffy user interface.

(BTW: for those of you "worried" about WWW, you should be worried about
gopherd, it has much bigger security holes per the CERT advisory).

MarcV -- do you know of any other security holes besides gopher?
I can't think of any off the top of my head.

Well, by some strange short circuit in my brain I missed the note about
">1024, which is wide open", but it still causes a problem with sites that
use ports 81 through 85 and other aribtrary ports less than 1024, as well as
certain gophers which accept http connections (eg, http://borg.lib.vt.edu:70/)
Certainly, there are less problems, but they are still there if you limit
what ports you can run the server on.

In general, I think it's safe to assume ports >1024 are OK.  There are
a few strange ways of using them I can imagine (e.g. sending malicious
code to somebody's X server) but my off-the-top-of-my-head opinion is
that they're not a real problem.

There are some low ports that people use, but they generally follow
the "real" ones by small values (e.g. additional HTTP ports are often
81, 82, 83, Ohio State uses these if I recall correctly, and
additional gopher ports are often 71 as you mention.)

My understanding is that real Gopher will never need CR or LF in its
titles, and thus it could be prohibited in Gopher URLs without
impacting functionality.  (I can't think of any supported protocol
that really needs them offhand, actually, but prohibiting them in all
URLs seems a bit harsh.)

Restricting to "reasonable" ports seems like a good idea.  How to
handle "suspicious-looking URLs" that don't use "reasonable ports" is
another matter; I personally would consider it fine to pop them up and
ask the user to examine the URL and confirm before the fetch is
performed.  Some people might think they should just be rejected
completely.

What you describe sounds sufficient IMHO; there's probably some other
kind of attack that nobody's thought of, but you can't anticipate
everything.

No, we should throw out application/postscript or fix ghostscript.

So throw out gopher or fix it.

All sounds great.  We were going to just disallow strange ports as per
Bill Perry's suggestion, but this sounds better.  A side effect
of this could be to improve WWW's showings on the net use charts
(which go by specific ports).  

We've compiled pre-release 3 and it has some niceities (specifically
the handling of search pages and the cache clearing under navigate).
Hopefully we can ship this out tomorrow with the security patch (of
course deemphasizing the latter) and move on to more positive stuff.

Thanks to all for the timely fix!

    They both make efforts to encode the semantics of the document (for
    instance, ``this is a heading'', ``this is emphasised text'') rather
    than attempting to encode the presentation of the document (for
    instance, ``this is 9pt Roman'', ``this is centred, bold, text'').
    I argue that this is not a sensible direction to take.

But it is sensible, as soon as you specify *real* presentation it's not
portable.  However...

What you call "abstract presentation" is exactly what we are doing now.
Most of the things you propose are *already* in HTML+, (some even back
washed into HTML like <HR> and <BR>) so what is the problem?

Style Guides then go a BIG step further in allowing authors to
design layout.

While I acknowledge that something should be done, Id be much more in favor of
excluding ports, rather than including ports.  I.e. disallow 25, instead of
allowing only 80, 70 etc..  Excluding all ports could cause havoc here, as
currently my server uses 3 ports (80 through 83).

Yes. A number of Gopher servers return documents that are actually
references to other TCP services that can conveniently (and safely) be
accessed by Gopher clients. These are mentioned in RFC1436:

   Note:  The client should be prepared for the server closing the
          connection without sending the Lastline.  This allows the
          client to use fingerd servers.

In addition to finger (port 79), you should also (at least) allow
other standard TCP services that don't need multi-line input, e.g.,
daytime (13) and whois (43) are certainly in use, and maybe a few
obscure ones like qotd (RFC865, port 17) or systat (RFC866, port 11).

As an example, the Gopher server here returns port-43 items to over
1000 clients every day. This does work ok; please don't disallow it.

I Agree completely!!  This is my official plee for marc and eric to
stop supporting such bad html.  Some of the things they have done 
I agree have usefulness, but there is TOO much tolorance for other
things that should never be tolarated.  Bad nesting is a good
example of this.  I can understand letting users put a <p> anywhere
in a document, but some of these other things UGGGGG!  Don't change
it now but remember that a golden oportunity exists with the 
release of xmosaic 2.0 to eliminate the crap.  Would someone be
willing to write a bad HTML to "mostly" valid HTML converter?
If we don't stop it now it will just get worse.

I purpose that we submit a list of the bad markup that is tolorable.
(i.e. <p>'s anywhere, etc.) That way we can all support these things
and maybe even write some consistent documentation.  All the rest,
like headers in lists, bad anchor/list/emphasis nesting, etc.
can be expunged.

Sick of bug reports because "It works in Mosaic",

Sorry to clutter up the airwaves with this announcement, but
it seemed important enough.

This is a request for anyone at CERN who is listening and
can take actions!!!!!!

The CERN HTTP server is returning "Can't open log file ..."
at the top of EVERY file.  This is severely screwing up
all mime header interpretations and shows up on every
screen.  If anyone can fix the server please do, otherwise
call someone you know at CERN and tell them about it. :)

We didn't intend to support the HTML in question.....

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</ul

<h3>Daniel LaLiberte</h3>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mosaic parser is simply looking at this like so:

        </ul <h3>

The second < is disregarded since it's looking for a > to close the
tag; the h3 (or possibly <h3; I'm not sure which exactly) is
considered an attribute of the /ul tag; the result is that it's saying
"OK, the list is closed and I'm ignoring this extra 'h3' attribute
that I don't understand".

This is just the way our parser works -- not our way of supporting bad
HTML.

BRRRRAAAAPPPP.... Sorry.  Not acceptable.  Many, many gophers run on other
ports than 70.  Most of the stuff I admin runs on other ports for the
simple reason that to limit access to a section of your gopher hierarchy
you need to run another server.

I think that I am not alone here.  </rr>

I beg your pardon.  MIME itself doesn't have a ghostview security hole.  The
MIME spec has a long section on the security risks assocaited with the
application/postscript content-type.  (No doubt some will say that MIME
should not have allowed a postscript type at all due to the inherent
security hazards...)

The gopher security problem is just an example of why any content-type needs

Sigh.  It seems such a pity that port allocation is dictated by silly
software limitations, and not just regarding this.  One well-designed
server should be able to do everything on just one port.
Unfortunately, since addresses tend to stick around, we're probably
stuck with multiple ports for quite a while until things get fixed
properly.

I think allowing ports of 70+n for small values of n and >1024 (and
maybe a couple other idioms) handles virtually all these (ugly) cases
though.  As long as the effect of suspicious ports is only a minor
inconvenience (present the URL, ask for confirmation) there isn't any
real functionality lost.

It might help if you said where the conflicts are intentional... :-)

While it might not be a bad idea to define such parameters for GIF (arguably
the rfc 1341 definition isn't detailed enough), but if they are to be used,
they should be written up in an RFC.  (normally an RFC wouldn't be
necessary, but since there's already an RFC that claims to document
image/gif, people would reasonably expect that a revised image/gif spec
would be in an rfc also.)

> Complex return type:
>   Content-Type: archive/tar; name="foo.tar"; encoding="compress, uuencode"


However, the meaning of each parameter (such as "encoding") is specific to a
particular MIME content-type.   So you shouldn't just tack on an "encoding"
parameter to an arbitrary type and expect it to have meaning.  Likewise,
readers should not interpret an encoding parameter without knowing what it
means for that particular type.

(For the moment I won't argue against use of "archive/*".  Actually, I might
end up agreeing that this is one way that MIME-as-used-in-WWW should differ
from MIME-as-used-in-email.)

There are security problems with both of these types that implementors need
to be made aware of.  In particular, all of these kinds of files can contain
\specials which could be used to exploit holes in PostScript; tex and latex
files can (and often do) scribble on your file system when processed.

In my experience, these are often not very interoperable.  dvi files need
particular fonts that aren't always installed; TeX and LaTeX often refer to
external macro packages and style files.  (This isn't an argument against
defining such types, only that you might want to consider adding additional
parameters stating what additional files/fonts are required, and what
classes of \specials need to be supported.)

>  application/texinfo 		texi		Texinfo

Any file which might be processed by emacs can exploit the emacs feature
that allows it to define a LISP procedure to be invoked when the file is
loaded.  (Of course any text file can be read with emacs, but this is the
normal thing to do with texinfo.)

>  application/troff-ms		ms		Troff w/MS Macros

Troff lets you scribble on files and run arbitrary programs.  Also, using
the transparent output facility, you can exploit holes in PostScript
interpreters.

(etc.)

Any of the archive formats is dangerous if they can contain absolute
pathnames.  Implementations used in WWW browsers should forbid extraction of
archive members with absolute pathnames and (maybe) require the recipient to
extract in an empty directory.

...

In general, you need to register all of the new names as MIME types unless
they begin with "X-".  Otherwise, MIME types for some of these will surely
be defined, and we will have to define type equivalences for WWW<->MIME.
(I fully expect there to be WWW-to-MIME gateways of various flavors.)

You can define these, separately, for each of your own types, but not for
MIME types that are already defined.

Alternatively, perhaps for WWW use you could define special X-WWW-*
parameters that include things like X-WWW-encoding.  Then a gateway would
know not to copy these parameters to a MIME-for-email document, without
having to know which parameters are really valid for which objects.

(Even better to have HTTP servers undo the encodings and transmit everything
as canonical-form octet-streams (or maybe with a single optional compression
algorithm).  Then the burden of supporting all of this stuff is shifted from
the client to the server, and the server administrator can choose to support
the encodings that his server uses.)

The next version of the MIME spec will delete the "name" parameter from
application/octet-stream, in favor of a content-disposition header (the spec
for which is currently an internet-draft).

same considerations.  In particular, it would be wrong to define a sample
rate for audio/basic...which is  *deliberately* fixed.  Better to define an
audio/general type and appropriate parameters.

In general, it is a bad idea for parameters to duplicate information that is
already in the content, UNLESS such information is necessary for a reader to
determine whether it can successfully read the object.  (I've seen readers
that can't handle (e.g.) JPEG greyscale, but I haven't seen one that can't
handle an image of arbitrary size, reducing it to fit if necessary.)

Agreed.  I would also encourage use of a metamail-compatible scheme for
this, just so users wouldn't have to configure things separately for WWW and
mail.

First off we are only talking about restricting gopher (I hope).
HTTP can't talk to SMTP anyway so no point in restricting it.

Second, if you are using anything below 1024 other than 80 for HTTP then
you are violating the basic principle of those being reserved ports and
you should ask yourself "why" you are using those ports?  Do you
know why they exist?

The basic idea is if you trust the host then you can trust all ports under
1024 to be what they say they are and not users running trojan horses
on them.

HTTP in general has nothing to loose by being spoofed so it doesn't have to
run on a secure port unless you are sending authentication or sensitive
information, and in those cases you should *ONLY* talk to port 80 on
trusted hosts (this is why you should never send anything you want kept
private via email, because it passes through untrusted hosts).

So please don't use ports other than 80 unless they are over 1024.
And browsers should warn users before sending sensitive information
(like userid/passwd in the clear) to ports other than 80.

It seems like bad design methodology to base protocol design on
a few special cases. So, try to decide in general whether allowing
HTTP connections to port 38 is a good idea, ignoring whether or not
there's one or two HTTP servers that listen on port 38.

Yes, if you disallow it, those sites will have to change to pick
other ports, but then, everybody's going to have to upgrade clients
anyway, and the owners of the servers can probably run another server
that listens on port 1083 too, leaving them both up for a while until
the extant URLs are fixed up.

If there weren't a simple migration strategy to more 'legit' ports,
I'd more sympathetic.

In fact, it would be lovely to suggest a couple of blocks of 'HTTP
port numbers', and ask everybody to migrate their usage to those.
(Well, for example, , how about 80-85 and 1080-1085?).

It would take a little while to transition, but then we'd get better
usage statistics, error checking, and less interference with other
protocols.

As for gopher nodes that point to finger servers, humph. Just because
a gopher server says 'host: foo.baz.edu' 'port: 79' 'path: joe' doesn't
mean you have to translate it to the URL <gopher://foo.baz.edu:79/joe>. 

Why not translate it to the URL  <finger://foo.baz.edu/joe>

I mean, yes, gopher server maintainers rely on this hack in the gopher
clients that they're willing to open up unusual sockets, but that
doesn't mean that the URL has to say 'gopher:', does it?

Gopher is the only scheme for which concrete vulnerabilities are known
(by me at least) right now.  Other schemes (ftp, wais, http, etc.)
seem to be specific enough that if you try to speak them to some other
service, you don't get anything dangerous (or even useful.)  However,
any schema added to the URL scheme should include this kind of
consideration, just as new MIME types require a security review.  No,
it's not exciting, but it needs to be there.

>So please don't use ports other than 80 unless they are over 1024.

I actually wonder sometimes about sites that never use port 80 and
only use high-numbered ones.  If the people running the server and the
people with root authority on that machine are not working together at
least enough to allow the server to use the right port, one wonders
about cooperation and stability.  I guess I'm guilty of discrimination
against differently-numbered people.  (well, actually I just want to
see our stats on the backbone traffic rise. :-)

If we're going to take this seriously, having the situation where the
browser presents the URL and asks for confirmation is almost
completely useless, since only a very small fraction of the total
users (for Mosaic, anyway) will have any idea what's going on, what's
OK, and what's not.  Most of them will simply be puzzled, and some
will be alienated (``why the hell is it spitting this dialog box full
of random garbage in my face?'').  We have to remember that the vast
majority of Internet users these days have no idea what significance
port 25 has, etc.

I do not agree that security is more important than functionality, as
if that were true the Internet would literally not exist because of
its manifold native insecurities.  If we are going to be concerned
with the security of this particular situation as you suggest, then we
have to go all the way -- we have to literally outlaw certain ports,
etc.  We therefore have to seriously address which ports are always
acceptable and which are always not, and be prepared to live with the
hit in functionality that may imply.

With that in mind, suppose we take the approach of only outlawing a
few ports as opposed to restricting the valid range to a given set
(both approaches have been suggested).  What ports other than 25
should be outlawed?

If you are going to use low numbered IP ports (e.g 81, 82, 83) for
HTTP then you should register that usage with the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (iana@venera.isi.edu).

You have no way of guaranteeing that these low numbered ports will
not be assigned in the future to some other official network service,
and you will be unhappy when that happens.

I agree with this completely.  Over on our side, we have "extended"
HTML a little for our needs, which, amongst other things, included the
ability to share information at a structure level (for example, my chapter
2 is actually your chapter 7 or even your section 5). 
However, we wanted "compatibility" with HTML so that we can share the vast 
amount of resources available there.
We had a hard time with <P> basically because it's not a container in
HTML but should be one in our case.

:) which is much nicer, which - again - illustrates the desirability of

However, you'll loose the ability to utilize old HTML documents which
are already out there, wouldn't you? since your "H1" is now a container
for both the TITLE and the rest of the "sub-document" (similarly for
H2, H3....).

What we did was to define it this way:

<!ELEMENT HD1  - -  ( H1,(%s.zz|HD2)*) -- part       -->

This is exactly the point I was trying make yesterday. Bad markup
(ie.  markup that violates the rules defined in the DTD) is
BAD. Period. 

Browsers should produce error messages whenever they encounter bad
markup. If they don't, you can't reasonably expect information
providers ("authors") to get it right, can you?

I disagree, because that approach will lead to endless discussions as
to whether which types of "bad markup" are most acceptable. If you
want to permit <P> et al. all kinds of strange places (I, for one,
don't), then permit it in the DTD for heaven's sake. Everything else
is anarchy, which will take us nowhere.

Ok, check this out now.

http://www.bsdi.com/HTTP:TNG/MIME-ClientProfile.html

It now strictly deals with Accept: attributes (I cleaned it up a bit).
Thanks to Keith for the feedback on the first pass.  Come on you
browser writers and hypertext authors speak up, what do you want/need.

In case anyone doesn't know what the Client Profile stuff is about; it's
a way of allowing the browser to tell the server what it can do (black &
white or color, how many colors, how big is the screen, etc etc) so the
server can return the most appropriate data (if it's smart enough).

I need browser writers to make sure they can provide this information
(either by knowing the answers or having the user setup a config file).
This isn't important stuff right now but if we want publishers like
ORA to use the Web then we need to make stuff look nice on a wider
variety of platforms.

Question:  Should we give up on archive/*, MIME already went and
defined application/zip for PKZIP files so I'm about to give up
on the idea and use application/*.  Anyone care?
I wanted archive/* so I could map it to ``pax'' in a single bound
as it handles most archive formats that I care about. e.g.:
    archive/shar -> save-as
    archive/* -> pax -s/^\/*//
pax handles bcpio cpio sv4cpio sv4crc tar ustar and soon gtar and
it's freely available.

Yes, you can.  If they follow the spec, they're clean.  If they don't,
they're not.  This is independent of whether or not we tolerate more
deviation than someone else.

Allright.

> How is that condescending?  

Well, to me it implied that I couldn't express my opinion about error
message reporting, except if I was part of the browser coding WWW
hard-core. Well, I'm sorry if I got it wrong.

> And how's your browser coming?

Well, I work at the Euromath Center (as you can see from my
signature), which is part of the Euromath Project. Euromath develops
an environment for research mathematicians, for editing math
documents, searching on-line databases, sending mail, stuff like
that. Everything is based on SGML, at the core of Euromath we have a
commercial SGML editing engine, GATE, which we bought from (and partly
co-developed with) Grif S.A. in Paris, France.

Euromath lets you do WYSIWYG editing (well, you probably know about
the qualifications you need to make that a meaningful proposition.
Anyway, in Grif/GATE you a presentation specification for each DTD,
which is then used for editing, printing and so on.) of SGML. We have
developed our own Euromath DTD, and are part of the standardisation
effort to get a common Math DTD fragment. 

I'm responsible for the development of a prototype Network Information
Service in Euromath. So far I have developed a Gopher browser, and I
have built a client which downloads SGML (Euromath DTD) files from our
WWW server using HTTP.

I've also written a DTD equivalent to the current HTML, which lets me
do WYSIWYG editing of WWW documents, and then export them to HTML. I'm
considering writing an export facility from the Euromath DTD to
HTML[+].

What I HAVEN'T done, is write a translator from HTML (or HTML+) to my
HTML-equivalent DTD. Therefor, at the moment, I can't import HTML docs
into Euromath. -- This is where all moaning and groaning about bad
markup comes in. 

WWW was perfect for us: It was there, lots of interested information
providers (there is already quite a bit out there, as you know), AND
it uses (claimed to use) SGML. -- Should be a piece of cake, 3 months'
work, and we'd provide the Euromath community with access to all sorts
of information from within their own environment.

The catch, of course, is that we can't handle bad markup, our editing
engine is TRUE SGML; there is no way it will handle tags in all kinds
of strange places. Never. Of course, writing the translator from
HTML[+] to our HTML-equivalent DTD, I could anticipate some problems,
and handle them, but there's no prospect that I can handle
everything.

So how's my browser coming along? Well, right now I'm waiting to see
what HTML+ will look like in the end (soon, I hope?). If the result is
reasonable, I'll try make a translator. Otherwise, we'll probably
build our own little distributed hypertext, using our own DTDs (but,
perhaps, using HTTP). That outcome would be a real shame, since there
is so much attractive (sic!) information available through WWW/HTML.

Enough said.

Cheers,

Klaus

To fill in the context for this transfer of a private email msg to a
broader audience: Mr. Harbo sent me email (I have since deleted it)
saying "I am writing a browser; don't be condescending; I see it's
late where you are so I'll take that into account" or something along
those lines; below, he quotes my email response to that.

Of course you can express your opinion, and of course I can either
disagree with it, or (as I in fact did) express surprise that the
situation affects you -- as I was in fact not aware that you are
writing a browser yourself.

Lately I have been getting pounded on from all sides on a number of
issues.  The latest seems to be the fact that we have a more robust
parser/formatter than most other browsers.  As is usual when I have
people on all sides telling me wildly contradictory things (it's
wonderful, it's horrible -- and yes, people do use those exact
adjectives), I'm not sure what to think.  All I know is, Abe Lincoln
was right.

Thanks for the info on your work; it's very interesting.

Marc

What is it about the nature of HTML which makes WYSIWYG impossible?

Maybe I misunderstand what you expect of a WYSIWYG editor, but there 
are several commercial SGML editing packages which would claim to 
be (and are to my way of thinking) WYSIWYG.

The one I'm familiar with allows markup in a few different ways.

 o A pull-down menu of all of the tags is available (which can be 
   configured to group related elements) and tags which are not valid 
   in context are greyed out.
 o A pinable popup window is generated which lists alphabetically all of 
   the valid tags in context.
 o Striking the return key enters a new tag if the context is unambiguous 
   and depending on user defined rules.
   i.e. return in a paragraph creates another paragraph container.
        return in a list element creates another list element.

The user can toggle between states where the tags are displayed or not.  
Without tags displayed, it is to all intents and purposes WYSIWYG.

HTML+ will be a different kettle of fish however, given the size 
of its vocabulary (tags + attributes).  If, as I hope, the idea of 
supporting non-conformant documents is dropped some sort of validating 
editor will be required, whether full WYSIWYG or not.

Anything that broadens the options has to be a good thing.  Converters 
are a good way of getting documents quickly into the Web.

However, I think (picking up on Nat's comments in http://www.vuw.ac.nz/\
non-local/gnat/converters.html) that the HTML+ DTD should stand on its own 
feet as a usable DTD with "broad appeal".  A common DTD encoding semantic 
information is obviously important for document exchange and reuse, and so 
we should strive to achieve this however difficult the task may seem.

A DTD describing an "abstract presentation information" (which Nathan 
suggests) is no more or less than _another_ presentation format.  Surely 
we can aim higher that that.

Subject: Unsubscribing (even temporarily!)
Status: RO

OK - another day, and I'm still getting 50+ messages a day from www-talk.
This is FLOODING my mailbox, and I will probably hit the system limit if I go
away for a couple of weeks, which is my intention. Also, it is a pain sorting
out the www-talk mail from all the other stuff, which dribbles in, even though
I am fascinated by what's going on.

So, can someone remind me how to unsubscribe, even for just a few weeks...

Thanks.

This isn't a MIME problem, since the security aspects re postscript are
documented in the MIME RFC. Also, the ghostscript has been fixed a while
ago by adding a SAFER mode. More recently ghostview 1.5 is using this mode by
default, so the problem is hopefully no more.

Subject: Re: Restricted ports
Status: RO

I strongly agree with arguments on limiting http access to a very
minimal set under 1024 and pushing for servers to either move
their port numbers to this restricted set or above the 1024 level.

****From Tony Sanders***************
Second, if you are using anything below 1024 other than 80 for HTTP then
you are violating the basic principle of those being reserved ports and
you should ask yourself "why" you are using those ports?  Do you
know why they exist?

The basic idea is if you trust the host then you can trust all ports under
1024 to be what they say they are and not users running trojan horses
on them.

HTTP in general has nothing to loose by being spoofed so it doesn't have to
run on a secure port unless you are sending authentication or sensitive
information, and in those cases you should *ONLY* talk to port 80 on
trusted hosts (this is why you should never send anything you want kept
private via email, because it passes through untrusted hosts).

So please don't use ports other than 80 unless they are over 1024.
And browsers should warn users before sending sensitive information
(like userid/passwd in the clear) to ports other than 80.
****************************************

*****From Larry Masinter****************
It seems like bad design methodology to base protocol design on
a few special cases. So, try to decide in general whether allowing
HTTP connections to port 38 is a good idea, ignoring whether or not
there's one or two HTTP servers that listen on port 38.
  

In fact, it would be lovely to suggest a couple of blocks of 'HTTP
port numbers', and ask everybody to migrate their usage to those.
(Well, for example, , how about 80-85 and 1080-1085?).

It would take a little while to transition, but then we'd get better
usage statistics, error checking, and less interference with other
protocols.

*******************************

Agreed, though I don't know if we need to restrict on the higher
range.  If we have a need for more than one port under 1024, let's 
get IETF to register them:

***********From Ed Vielmetti***************
If you are going to use low numbered IP ports (e.g 81, 82, 83) for
HTTP then you should register that usage with the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (iana@venera.isi.edu).

You have no way of guaranteeing that these low numbered ports will
not be assigned in the future to some other official network service,
and you will be unhappy when that happens.
********************************* 

I assume that port 80 is already assigned by this group to http.

Consensus?  To allow some flexibility, maybe we could have a Makefile
parameter for "acceptable ports".

Grab the parser out of Mosaic and use it as a translator to spit back out

I have to agree that it would be nice if all documents worked
reasonably everywhere and I think the only way to do that is for
everyone to stick closely to the DTD.  Otherwise you have the
NCSA Mosaic dialect, and the Lynx dialect etc.  In the initial
stages I don't think this was as important as it is now, we
needed the ability to experiment.  If we want wider acceptance
of the Web we need to all agree on the syntax and if we to play
SGML then we need to make that syntax fit in the DTD (no matter
how ugly it makes the DTD).

Nope, image retrievals don't get put in the .mosaic-global-history file.
I just turned on my global history, and loaded the dangerous document to

I put a lot of thought into this for HTML+ and eventually came up with what I
believe is an elegant solution. The current draft of the spec doesn't do
justice to these ideas and I intend to clarify them in the next edition.

The basic idea is to allow people to specify hierarchical structures such
as topic, sections, chapters, parts, books etc. which can spread across a
number of retrievable nodes. The next idea is to allow links between these
structures to be expressed explicitly or implicitly via rules.

When browsing a given chapter, the table of contents, glossary, etc. should
be shown as menu items (or as buttons on a toolbar), so that they are always
visible and can't be scrolled out of sight. These links are defined
explicitly as LINK elements or implicitly by the context.

Explicit links seem fine at first sight, but rapidly become tiresome for large
structures - basically the same links have to be repeated many times and
this gives rise to consistency problems. You also have difficulties when
you want to include the same node in different books etc. which would need
different links for the same properties.

Implicit links solve these problems. The "table of contents" property is
propagated to included nodes when you move between parts of the same book.
This may sound tricky, but in fact boils down to a few simple rules.

Please let me know what you think. I would very much appreciate suggestions
as to how to improve the description of these features in the HTML+ spec.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

p.s. the spec is available at ftp://15.254.100.100/pub as
        htmlplus.ps (A4) and htmlplus8.5x11.ps (Legal)

The trick is to allow device independent presentation while still providing
the most common semantics.  HTML/HTML+ is ultimatly a presentation language
and there is no way around it.  If you cannot convert most DTD's to
HTML/HTML+ then we are back to square one because it is *impossible* to
include semantics for everything under the sun.

Will we ever be free of the SGML "presentation is evil, evil I say" party
line?  If you want anyone to be able to read your SGML then you have to
have some presentation somewhere.  HTML/HTML+ is a compromise between
allowing as much semantic content as possible -- while still having a
finite DTD -- but still allowing a wide variety of data to be encoded
for (here is that evil word again) presentation.

HTML/HTML+ is presentation with semantics, keep saying that over and over.

On the other hand maybe you know something I don't.  If you can write a
DTD that does everything that everyone needs without using any presentation
then get in contact with Dave Raggett <dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com> and see what
you two can work out.  Oh, BTW, most of the actuall presentation
is in what we are calling a "Style Guide" that is external to the
HTML/HTML+ document and provides hints to the browser about how to
render the document (so you can use the authors style guide, or your
own personal favorite).

When we talk about presentation in HTML+ we are mostly talking about tables
and external graphical image layout (e.g., gif's).  Someone should make
a list of the presentation like elements in HTML+.

HTML+ also provides a solution for printing, via the "print" attribute for
links. This determines whether a link is to be treated as a cross reference,
a footnote (when nodes are short enough to be included as a footnote) or as a
separate section.

And port 81 is already assigned to the HOSTS2 Name server, and port
82 is already assigned to the XFER Utility, and port 83 is already
assigned to the MIT ML Device, and . . .

I don't think that exclusion is the way to go.  If we're going to exclude
any services listed in the Assigned Numbers RFC (rfc1340 right now) that
look like they might be dangerous, we'd better exclude 71-74 (Remote Job
Service), 82 (XFER Utility), etc.  Most of the "funky" ports that are
currently in use are already officially assigned to something else, and
when you connect to port 82 on joe.random.host you can't be sure whether
you're getting the XFER utility or the httpd that someone stuck on some
random port.

With exclusion, you can never be sure that you excluded enough.

Yes, it will require people to redo their configurations, but arguably,
any configuration with an HTTP server running on a port <1024 != 80 is
wrong.  I think that any non-experimental additional HTTP servers should
either get assigned numbers from the IANA or use ports >1024 .

But the %## things aren't expanded in the HTTP URL so you can't send a
valid SMTP command from an HTTP URL.  Have you done otherwise?

FYI: archive/tar isn't an encoding, it's a content-type.

This does raise the question of what does Accept-encoding mean and
how does it fit in with Content-transfer-encoding.

I would say we should process the Accept: fields in order and use the
previous fields as defaults for the rest of the types.  Does this
violate anyones sensibilities.  The reason the client profile is
attached to the type itself is they could very well be different, e.g.:

   Accept: image/gif; class=color; depth=8; xdpi=85; ydpi=85
   Accept: application/postscript; depth=1; xdpi=600; ydpi=600

This might be because you plan on printing postscript but viewing gif's
Of course, this is a silly example because the server isn't going to do
anything with the postscript information but this gives you an idea of
why the data is per content-type.  We discussed this at WWWWW and decided
to do it this way.

So my question is what the heck is Accept-encoding: for?  Should it
be called Accept-transfer-encoding: and use the MIME transfer encodings
or what?

What might be really nice would be if the style sheets themselves could be
formalized in some fashion, so that a document could consist of a semantic
component (HTML, HTML+) and a presentation component (HTPL?) which would
indicate how each (named?  semantic?) region should be presented.  

A WYSIWYGBNWOMG (8-) editor could generate the two components.  If different
HTPL's could be defined for different presentation domains (textual,
textual/graphical,audio/verbal, virtual reality), documents could become very
very very flexible, without losing the ability for authors to have control
over the presentation of their baby.  nteresting new things could be done if
these HTPL's could be referenced in a standard way by a document LINK, or by
an attached annotation.

Any discussion as to how HTML+ would have to be modified to allow this kind of
thing?  It seems that as long as you have named containers that you could do
quite useful (and specific) things with this without losing generality.

One test of the viability of a HTML+/HTPL solution would be if it would
allow you to be flexible in controlling where an image would go in a page
relative to text.  NCSA Mosaic is rather frustrating in this regard
currently.. it would be nice to be able to center an image on a line,
for instance, or to have text wrap around an image..

OK, lets get it into the DTD!  We still have maybe a week or two before
Tim has a chance to update the DTD to what we decided on at the WWWWW,
so lets give everyone else a chance to put in their two cents about
what should be in there.  Does anyone wish to purpose a list of
things (bad markup perhaps?) that are currently supported by browsers,
(Xmosaic in particular), that should be added to the HTML 1.0 DTD.

HTML/HTML+ doesn't change at all and it's pretty trivial to implement.

It's hard to do too much of this in a device independant way.

I am very interested in clarifying the spec for search strings as I see it
as being an enabler for the forms that can be specified with HTML+.

In an earlier message I suggested taking advantage of the special characters
permitted in search strings to specify attribute value pairs and boolean
operators. (see http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/BNF.html)
What we need now is some guidelines for this to be included in the HTRQ spec.

The following lists the special chars along with suggested roles:

        $       Prefix for variable names
        _       Used as ordinary char in identifiers
        @       Infix operator as in attribute@value
        !       Logical negation
        %       For escaping other characters e.g. %20 for the space char.
        ^       Logical disjunction
        &       Logical conjunction
        *       Not sure what to use this for ...
        (       Left bracket for grouping things
        )       Right bracket for grouping things
        .       Decimal point in numbers or period in text.

It would be very useful to also allow:

        ,       minor separator
        ;       major separator

These are needed for sending lists of points, as in the ismap mechanism for
IMG. Are there any problems in extending the definition of "xalpha" Tim?

Any comments?

HTML+ does indeed provide support for hierarchical containers via the
"GROUP" element. This allows such hierarchies to span arbitrary numbers
of nodes spread all over the world (thanks Tony). The element includes
a role attribute to indicate the type of container, chapter, section, ...

Lou's TEI DTD forces people to define headers in strict order, e.g.
H1 H3 H2 is illegal as H3 is out of sequence. I think this is unnecessarily
strict for our purposes.

Should be ints. The HTML+ spec assumes that if floats are used then
the browser is using scaled coords in range 0.0 to 1.0. For ints
it assumes they are pixel offsets.

In the WWWWW discussion, one goal that emerged for WYSIWYG
editors was to help naive users author in HTML. It was
also assumed that naive users would expect such an editor
to work much like their graphical word processor. There were
some fine points of user interface design such as:

- If I have tag display turned off (i.e., WYSIWYG), and I
place the insertion cursor at the junction between two
elements, where am I?  I could be at the end of the first
element, between them, or at the beginning of the second.
The visual display has to inform the author.

- What happens if I drag-select across tag boundaries, from
the middle of one element to the middle of the next? What
do I get when I paste that?

- How do I sometimes select a complete element
and other times just select the text content of an
element (say for replacement) without selecting the element
markers?

I don't doubt that there are solutions to these (and
other) interface problems. But the solutions require
providing more information to the author, and the
author understanding what that information means.
Structured editing takes some getting used to.

The purpose is to stop attacks on systems.  All the ports you've named are not
widely used for their intended purpose, and as such dont present a problem
(IMHO).  Exclusion is the better answer, why break the world when you do not
need to?  Justification for religous reasons just isnt enough (IMHO).

I've heard several people asking for nested section
containers in HTML+.   Could one of you please explain
how you would break up a very large hierarchical
document into small enough file pieces to be
useable over the Internet?  How would each file
piece be marked up?  I posted this question
recently and got zero response.

I'm for proper use of SGML, but this seems to be
a serious problem with nested containers (unless
I'm missing something).  Dave Raggett's GROUP tag
in HTML+ seems to be an elegant solution.  I'm
curious what the SGML experts think of it.

So since you don't run XFER, and none of your friends run XFER, it's a good
idea to leave open a possible security hole in the relationship between WWW
and XFER?

Not at all, because XFER isnt wide spread, the chances of someone writing a
specific attack for XFER is close to zero.

Given that gopher servers already exist on many random ports, it seems like
simply restricting ports isn't quite the right solution.

I realize this is somewhat up to the gopher guys, but how about declaring
that: any gopher URL that (a) specifies a port other than the "standard"
gopher port, and (b) includes a newline, is not valid?

Do gopher servers really (in practice) accept newlines in query strings?

Nathan was suggesting disposing of semantic information altogether.  That 
is what I object to.  There are clear advantages to identifying semantic 
content.

The trouble with saying that HTML/HTML+ is ultimately a presentation language 
is that is IMHO a bit short sighted.  By adding structure to documents, you 
open up a lot more possibilities.  Presentation is one use, but why 
exclude others by disposing of the semantic markup.  Index building, search 
in context etc.

I agree with you in that we can't expect to have an HTML+ DTD which has 
all the semantic elements you would ever want.  That should not preclude 
trying to come up with a usable set however, with a facility for those 
that don't fit.

I would rather see it as semantics with presentation :-)

The style sheet idea is great.  By extracting the information from the 
document, you inevitably get more control for less effort.  On this 
subject, this has been the area of a lot of work in the SGML community - 
coding presentation information.  Are you familiar with the FOSI 
standard (US DoD) or the DSSSL standard.  I'm not suggesting adopting 
them, but they may contain some useful ideas/pointers to the issues.

Dave and I have exchanged a few mails.  I disagreed with the notion of 
having the semantic content coded as attributes to <p> and <em>.  This 
makes the structure of the DTD very flat and I would rather see it more 
hierarchical.  The <cite> element is a good case in point.  I would like 
to see this as a container with say <author> <isbn> <publisher> etc as 
sub-elements.  More hierarchy, more structure, without compromising the 
ability to add presentation information in any way.

It also leaves open the evolution of the DTD without the problem of 
"Hell - how can I add a content model to an attribute".  I.e. if you 
code say <head> as an attribute, it can't then contain <title>, <isindex> 
etc.

Once again, let me jump in and agree and point out that today's Friday the 13th
(let's fix it before a black cat crosses our path...).  Since 81-85 ports
seem to be assigned, the use of port 80 only (and >1024 seems fine).  Let's
get the thing fixed "officially" before the "cat's out of the bag".  I would
have liked to have avoided distributing multiple fixes, but the process seems to
have failed.

Excellent idea (really).

The US DoD as part of the CAL initiative defined a format for the coding 
of presentation information.  A document coded to this format is called a FOSI 
(Formatting Output Specification Instance).  You could have as many FOSI's 
as you want for one SGML DTD.  Exactly what you describe.  I wouldn't suggest 
adopting the FOSI standard (too heavy), but it contains some useful ideas.

Exactly what the separation of content and presentation is all about.  Don't 
me mislead when you hear SGML freaks go on about the evil of presentation 
information in a document.  Of course you need control of presentation, but 
put it in a style sheet.

Ahem... the discussion of excluding of certain ports, versus restricting to
specific ports, versus disallowing certain strings in gopher accesses, misses
the mark, IMHO.  Please correct me where I'm out of line -- I haven't
researched this fully -- but I believe that the problem can be scoped down
rather quickly:


The general problem is that WWW makes it possible for a network service to
be invoked on an arbitary host, on behalf of an unwitting user.  Normally,
this is a Good Thing, and it's one of the Web's strong points.  However,
it is possible to misuse it by sending malicious commands to a service.

The only case in point that I'm aware of uses the gopher: scheme to send
malicious commands to some other service (smtp, mainly, but nntp was also
mentioned), using the optional "port" parameter in the URL to point to the
other service.  I haven't seen any discussion of possible misuse of a scheme
with it's _own_ protocol (e.g. sending nasty commands to a gopher server
using "gopher:").  I also haven't seen any discussion of possible misuse
of any scheme except for gopher:, presumably because gopher: is so free-formed
and does not have the familiar identified commands and responses (e.g. ftp).


If all of that is true, then we only need to worry when ( scheme <> port )
and when ( scheme == gopher ).  What we're worried about is that the actual
service on the port isn't a gopher server. So why not validate the server
iff ( scheme == gopher ) && ( port <> 70 ) ?

This might sound familiar -- I suggested it yesterday, but maybe it went
unnoticed because you only got one copy of the message :-)

Validating a gopher server is not straightforward, because the initial
connection to gopher doesn't return some nice string like "Hi, I'm gopher".
Maybe there's a gopher command which could be used to validate (is anyone
aware of such a command?).

Alternatively, you could look for _any_ returned string upon initial connection
and use that to decide that it isn't a gopher server, because gopher servers
connect silently.  This would at least rule out ftp, smtp, telnet, nntp, and
all other services which announce their presence upon initial connection.
Are there any other recognized services which do _not_ announce themselves?

I hoped that the H1-Hn tags can be junked in favour of a single container 
element with the nesting depth of this element being determined by the 
browser, in order that the formating would reflect the depth of nesting.

I have seen it suggested that by using this scheme, in order to format a (lets 
call it) meta-document which spanned several files and/or nodes, all files 
would need to be retrieved, which would be an unnacceptable overhead.

I do not understand this argument (the need to retrieve all the sub-documents).
Would somebody be good enough to explain it to me because its bugging me, and 
introducing a single <header> or <group> would seem to make sense.

I would have thought that because all tags are (or can be) paired that one 
part of a meta-document (what I called a sub-document) could be formatted 
sensibly in isolation to its other parts.

Steve.

You can't look for returned strings because that's non-deterministic
and doesn't solve the problem (as it's based on a timeout).

If gopher doesn't need newlines then it seems to me the best solution
is to just truncate the URL at the first newline.

Well, it's not as nice as one might like, but you end up dealing with
timeouts in the process of transacting with the protocol anyway.

I like this better than port number exclusions/restrictions, but it too
is non-deterministic.  It works in the cases of SMTP and NNTP (as does
validating the service), but it's conceivable that some other service
could be maliciously invoked with a single-line command.

How can WYSIWYG have meaning when presentation is the function of the
browser?  Perhaps this isn't the point of all the discussion; I guess what
people are really asking for are editors that automate HTML creation; or
are they asking for editors that make best guesses at proper structural
markup -- basically editors attached to LaTeX or RTF filters?

I hope I'm not just making noise -- not being a developer, one sometimes
mis-states questions and the like in a developer's community.

Trying to decide how to best figure out this issue is tricky; I'll try
to summarize and interject a little more and rant and rave a bit less.
:-)

As many have noted, low (< 1024) port numbers are assigned by the
IANA, and documented in various documents (RFC 1340 is reasonably
current.)  In particular, ports 71-79 (except 76) and 81-89 are all
already assigned to other services; using them for other purposes like
additional Gopher or HTTP servers is just plain wrong.  It is
(unfortunately) true that some server implementations for gopher and
HTTP do not allow sufficient functionality, and one way to enhance it
is to run multiple servers on different ports.  This is a mere
limitation of particular software implementations, however; it is not
appropriate to violate port allocation guidelines because of
inadequate software.  Fix the software.  If multiple servers simply
must be run on the same machine, use high ports for the non-primary
ones.

The issue of using this variety of "trick" to make Gopher do clever
hacks like accessing finger servers and whois servers is a touchy one.
Is this trick really part of Gopher proper, or just a trick that
happens to work?  If the former, we're obliged to support it (if
grudgingly, though it's no worse than the typing system...)  A casual
reading of the Gopher informational RFC suggests that it's just a
clever trick, though it's hard to say since it's an informational
document and not a real standard.  Despite all this, it's a good idea
to try to keep as much of this functionality as we can reasonably do.

Some have suggested that we keep a list of "dangerous/insecure ports"
I'll call these DIPs, and call that enumeration "The DIP list".  I
believe a DIP list is not a viable approach; anyone who believes it
is should take a look at the RFC.  It would be necessary to become
sufficiently proficient in the protocols used by each assigned service
to perform a review of the security implications of each.  There are,
based on a casual count with sort -u | wc, well over 200 of them; I
don't know about you, but I don't wish to become an expert on 200
things and evalute the security implications of them all.  This
evaluation would need be maintained over time as protocols are revised
and new ones arise, checking for DIP problems.  Do you volunteer to
keep the DIP list current?  I sure don't.

An alternative is to keep a "safe/approved port" list, or SAP list.
(Thus the battle is the dips versus the saps. :-) An enumeration of
ports which should be safe and useful (ones that look promising off
the top of my head include 7, 13, 17, 43, 70, 79, 80, 105...) is
probably easier to create, and less likely to have perpetual
vulnerabilitties due to being out of date.  Omissions in SAP could
cause minor functionality limitations (how limited is an
implementation issue), while omissions in DIP could cause new
vulnerabilities.

While we're at it, there is now no particular security reason not to
allow some form of the tcp: scheme suggested by someone (Rob Raisch?)
a while back, since gopher: provides the equivalent functionality
anyway.  So the idea could be re-evaluated.

The other proposed modification involves eliminating the ability to
encode multiple lines; to try to keep with the spirit, I'll name this
"Single Lines Always Considered Keen", or SLACK.  The particular
attacks with things like SMTP and NNTP require multiple lines
separated by CRLFs to work properly; nobody has yet proposed a
successful attack with just a single line, though it could happen.
SLACK also has the distinct advantage of making our security situation
pretty much the same as it is for the rest of the Gopher world, which
increases the likelihood that Gopher folks will discover any potential
problems sooner, once we're in the same boat.

There are two different sub-portions of this plan:
- Patch the current problem, quickly.
- Come up with a more general approach to make sure other instances of
  this kind of thing don't happen again

It's OK for these to be two different fixes, as long as fixing the
former doesn't lull people into a false sense of security about the
need to do the latter.  The SLACK approach is probably the best quick
fix; it fixes this and shouldn't involve any loss of functionality.
Deciding other implications, debating DIP vs. SAP, and the like can
come after that.

Marc VanH has summed up the options pretty well.  I think it
should be noted that the SLACK fix is not only tightens security
but it is a bug fix as well.  Allowing newlines, carriage returns
or tabs in gopher selectors is going outside the gopher protocol.
If going outside the protocol isn't a bug, I don't know what is.

Aaah, now this is a good point and the first time I've heard it
explicitly raised.  If HTML+ is to be a DTD that encodes semantic
information for document interchange, then it should be exposed to
criticism and comments from a large group of people --- namely those
who are producing SGML documents at the moment.  If we do less than
this, we run the risk of producing something sub-optimal.

Surely we can, but do we really want to?  The power of SGML isn't, as
is often touted, the ``removing of presentation from the markup'', but
really the separation of presentation and semantics.  Obviously this
requires a presentation-free DTD, but doesn't preclude encoding the
presentation (what SGMLers call the ``style-sheet'') in another DTD.

What I envision is people writing their documents in whatever DTD they
feel best suits their semantics.  Then they convert their SGML to
HTPL, a common presentation format for the web, and this is what is
put on the web.  If we create a DTD that encodes portable semantics,
then by golly, they can convert their SGML to PSL (portable semantics
language) and make *that* available as well, but there's no good
reason to mix the two --- they serve different purposes.  The
presentation version is for human reading, the portable version for
everything else.

<IMG SRC=blah PLACE=centre TEXT=around>

<.............PLACE=right TEXT=below>

PLACE is ``centre'' means centre the image
PLACE is ``left''   means the image is on the left side of the page
PLACE is `right''   means the image is on the right side of the page

TEXT is ``mixed'' means text in the same paragraph as the IMG flows
	around the image
TEXT is ``above'' means the image is placed below the text of the
	paragraph the IMG is in
TEXT Is ``below'' means the image is placed above the text of the

Rendering is a two-pass job --- grab the whole para, and if it
contains <IMG> work out the order and formatting.  Then display.

I've been puzzling how to reasonably integrate into WWW and XMosaic
access to multi-page documents that are *only* available as multi-page
images. We (and a number of other organizations) have large
collections of documents that are only available currently on paper.

Some of them are just a few pages; many reports are 40-50 pages, and,
of course, many books are hundreds of pages.

It is reasonable -- at least as reasonable as sending talk radio -- to
think about reading books on a high-resolution screen across the
internet.

The question is, how to build this kind of access into WWW.

The first thing to realize is that it isn't reasonable to transfer the
entire document before starting to read it. That might work for
something that is a page or two, but doesn't work well at all for a
30-40 page report, and much less for a 300 page book.

A typical page image scanned at 300 DPI binary and compressed with T.6
(Group 4) compression might be 30-50K bytes.

A couple of alternatives come to mind:

a) try to squeeze this into HTML+++ somehow.
  I've thought of some possibilities here, along the lines of the
current discussion of online 'books' with chapters and indices, but
allowing for inline images to be retrieved as 300DPI compressed
binary, but decompressed and antialiased to grey by the client).

b) create a new document type  application/bookreader, and a specific
application 'bookreader' which knows how to deal with 'books'. It
would be reasonable for a 'book' to consist just of a list of URLs or
URNs, one for each page, and build a special bookreader that retrieves
the images as you're reading the document online.

(a) seems hard, and I'm leaning toward (b). (b) has the slight
advantage that it can be shoehorned into systems that currently only
do 'gopher'. Have others thought of this issue? Opinions? Ideas?

-- Larry

p.s. it seems pretty clear that you can't get more concrete with
'presentation' than an image of the page.

I thought I had some objections to the style-sheets proposed.  I've
sat down and tried to think of some, and besides my vague discomfort
with (a) the fact that presentation won't be completely eliminated
from the HTML+ dtd and (b) the added complexity of converting the DTD
*and* the style-sheet, I couldn't really come up with anything.

I guess I support the style-sheet proposal, but would rather have had
my way :)

Thanks, Tony, for wading in on this.  Looks good except:

1. application/latex, troff-*, etc. should be text/* instead.  Something
should be supertype text when it can be treated as text/plain by default.
Note that this doesn't apply to Postcript, dvi, etc.

2. I like your archive supertype but if we go with it we should make sure
it gets into MIME proper.  Note that creating a new supertype is much
harder than creating a new subtype.

3. The non-standard types should all have "x-" in front of them.

I can't decide whether to resist the use of all those new types; we can't
just union all the operating-system-specific, platform-specific,
software-vendor-specific, company-specific, day-of-the-week-specific
formats and make any progress toward interoperability.  Seems to me this
long list could lead to two degenerate cases, at different parts of the
web at the same time:

a. a sophisticated browser with a rich set of builtin types and/or a
lengthy configuration of external viewers will describe its type
flexibility to servers in all its glory, in 20K chunks that take up
more bandwidth that a lot of document transfers;

b. with so many types and no clear priorities on which types to support,
simple browsers on improverished platforms with users who haven't bothered
to configure extended viewers will drive servers CRAZY trying to deliver
documents given a list of idiosynchatic formats.

Should we consider the danger of leaving image/cmu-raster (surely
sunraster is more ubiquitous) and archive/sv4cpio in the list?

Is MIME considering them as text/* types?

If it's useful MIME will adopt it.  Of course, the MIME types always
override whatever we define (e.g., they defined application/zip, so
I removed it from the archive type).

Consider these HTTP types and not MIME types.

Who gives a hoot, let the market sort it out.  The types should be defined
for those that need them.

I'm happy to add sunraster, what do you want me to call it?

That's such a good typology I'm sure Tony won't mind my citing it

In favor of using SGML elements:  they are flexible, at least
insofar as they won't break as soon as the text is edited.
They can be translated from one DTD to another, they can be
parsed in SGML along with the rest of the document, and 
they don't require some new method of reference.  I'd really
like to find a way to provide hooks in the SGML structure
for exterior references such as annotations.

In favor of using offsets:  they don't require
writing on the document, as does the SGML approach.

In either case we have a difficult problem of indentifying
the version of a document to which a given annotation 
refers, not to mention the intractable problem that people *will*
change their docs without revising their version numbers.
This came up in the discussion of URNs, and will recur, so
I'll leave it out here, noting only that we have a 
global problem of referring to versions of electronic documents,
especially as old versions may go away without trace.

Back to Tony's four cases (private, workgroup, public,
global).  In the first one, I am annotating somebody else's
document solely for my own use, like writing in the margins
of a book I own.  If I make a local copy of this document,
I can certainly use SGML elements to position annotations,
because I can write on my local copy.  

If I don't make a local copy and use offsets to position my 
annotations, I have no way of knowing when the document will change
and invalidate or otherwise screw up my offsets; the previous
version may not be available.  

I can cope with this by adopting various strategies according to 
how fast and in what ways I expect the annotated document to change; 
for example, if I thought the pieces of the document would stay in the 
same order while all growing larger, I might use a percentage 
offset (my annotation 1 is at 27.341% of the way through
the document).  If I thought the pieces would move around
I might use a string-matching method keyed to chapter titles.

Anyway, if I'm not sharing these annotations with anyone 
I can do them anyway I please, HTML+ or no.

In the second case, the workgroup, we are probably editing a joint
document, in which case we surely have a local copy and should
be using SGML to position annotations.  If we're using a remote
document we'd do well to make a local copy, but perhaps there
are three of us annotating a large corpus selected from 
HTML+-marked-up documents, we don't want to store them
locally, and we need to see each other's annotations.
On the other hand, if we don't want to store the files
locally they're likely to be larger than we can actually
read, so we may not need to have annotations popping up in
the margins, as long as we have access to the annotations
somehow.

Marc Andreesen responded to my earlier remarks on annotations 
this way:

=================
The way you (we) want to think of annotations is this: they're virtual
document modifications that may exist on any of several levels: fully
public but not physically attached to the document, fully public and
physically attached to the document [ecccch, I hope nobody actually
implements these], limited to a given subgroup of people, limited to
those who have expressed interest in the opinions of the annotator,
personal, etc.

This means the document author should not a priori be able to
"restrict" or "enhance" the capability of people to add annotations
that are not physically part of her document.  That is, you at
O'Reilly should not be able to affect how I at NCSA can add an
annotation to your document that can only be viewed by others at NCSA
-- and vice versa.  As long as the annotation isn't actually,
physically affecting your document, you shouldn't care what I do with
the annotation.  (Concomitantly, browsers should provide user
interfaces sufficiently well-designed to make it clear what's really
part of the document and what's an annotation added by some yoyo at
NCSA.)
=======================

This is like all of us writing in the margins
of a shared copy; or like all of us writing in the margins
of identical copies and then collating the results; or,
in the case described by Marc, like all of us writing in the
margins of the library copy.  I can imagine using offsets 
here, but better and more flexible would be to position 
annotations by one of the traditional methods used for
heavily annotated texts.  For scripture one cites chapter
and verse; for Shakespeare one cites play, act, and scene;
for the classics one cites editions, works, parts, and line numbers.
We could maintain local files on these remote works we're 
annotating, using traditional methods of pointing, and 
be rather surer that our annotations would be positioned
well when we got around to reading them again.  And by
using established hooks, we automatically collate our
joint annotations.  

In the third case, in which annotations are maintained publicly by
the server that owns the document, the server can write
on the document and insert the appropriate SGML.  This is
like publishing one's own text with later commentary in the margins.

The fourth, global case ("Probably will be distributed via USENET and 
subject to massive filtering to find only the items of interest to you.")
has no parallel in our current practice of writing or publishing.
On my own behalf, and not speaking for O'Reilly, I think this is 
a real bad idea, importing into the rest of the Internet 
all the worst of the unmoderated
newsgroups (read soc.culture.arabic recently?).  I do like the 
idea of being able to apply the same filter to the Web that I
apply to news (and mail!), but I don't want other authors and
publishers writing all over my documents, virtually, of course.

Especially when someone starts a global anonymous
annotation service like anon.penet.fi, it will be impossible for
me as a writer and publisher to communicate directly with my
readers without being filtered through some third (and ... nth)
party or parties.  (Sure, readers can adjust their filters, those
who can figure out how to do it, but this reverses the terms that
presently exist between publisher and reader.)  Indeed, I might be 
heckled or spoofed or flamed---at hundreds of spots sprinkled through 
my document.  Unlike publishing a text with commentary (the third case),
this is like being forced to publish my text with any marginal 
grafitti anyone cares to put in, extending the margins if need be;
or like being forced to republish the text continually to include
*all* reviews of it.  Why should I put up with that?

Marc writes:
===============
You'll always just be able to disregard/ignore the [annotations]
you don't want
to see, since they will practically never be physically attached to
the documents themselves and the act of fetching and displaying them
will always be a value-add your browser will perform only if you want
it too (I myself would probably never have my browser display any
fully public annotations, etc.)
===================

But some people will.  And once the first global annotations
start piling up on the latest trendy social-commentary annotation
server, or the flame-your-colleagues annotation server for my
discipline, I will never have a straight shot at my reader.
This is real unattractive.

In Frederick Roeber's remarks on his work on public annotations via 
usenet, he says,

==========
Fundamental in the system is a WAIS-like
(also usenet-interface-project-like) selection system,
where one can filter in/out annotations.

The natural news expiry system will expire annotations, too.
If an annotation is worth saving, I see two methods:
  1) the keeper of the original document likes the comment,
     saves it, and sticks in an actual reference, or
  2) (more sticky) if the annotation author really wants to
     say his annotation, then he stores it locally, and
     via some as-yet-unknown distributed server mechanism
     makes a pointer to it available.  This server could
     keep the annotation's URL, the URN of the thing 
     annotated, and maybe some meta-information.
I'm not really wild about the second point, but that's what
some discussions I've had with folks have ended up with.  I'd
suggest skipping it at the beginning, and seeing if it's
really needed.
================

I think that (1) is the only acceptable method (from the 
outset, not just after expiry of the annotation) if we
want to encourage people to publish on the Internet.
(2) is unacceptable---but it doesn't need offsets!

In the other cases of annotations everything hinges on having
a local copy of the document; if you do, you can annotated it
in SGML, but if you don't you have a choice between
mechanistic and fragile methods (offsets) or verbal and 
nonhypertexty ones.

Despite Marc's eloquent defense of offsets, I'd still like 
to encourage Dave to develop the annotation elements in
the HTML+ DTD to distinguish between the author's annotations
and other peoples's, encourage browser developers to make
element tags and their attributes (including IDs) usable
hooks for annotations, and encourage authors to provide
those hooks.  Our present method of reference is to 
files and SGML-named points in those files; we can probably
meet all our legitimate needs without importing an entirely
different mechanism.

Let me make a few random assertions:

(a) A document should *not* be considered validated merely because a
    browser (any browser) can handle it well.

(b) All World Wide Web browsers should properly handle all documents
    that have been properly, legitimately validated.

(c) If an information provider is serving documents that have been
    validated, he/she can be assured that all World Wide Web browsers
    handle them correctly.

(d) If a certain browser supports certain formatting features, quirks,
    options, or black magic above and beyond the specified formatting
    language, the information provider who is serving validated
    documents should not care at all, as it does not affect the
    information consumer's view of his/her documents regardless of the
    browser the information consumer is using.

(e) If a certain browser supports certain formatting features, quirks,
    options, or black magic above and beyond the specified formatting
    language and it turns out that many information providers *choose*
    to take advantage of those features even at the expense of making
    it difficult or impossible for other browsers to properly handle
    their documents, then this is proof that such a feature deserves
    very close inspection as something that should be a standard
    supported feature across all browsers: "the market has chosen".

(Now donning my fire-proof bodysuit... :-)

Marc

If Marc wants to allow his browser to do things beyond the HTML+
DTD that eventually gets approved, it is his responsibility to 
describe this functionality in an extension to the DTD.  

And if users invoke this functionality with documents that are
invalid according to the DTD, his browser should complain even
while it complies.  

In other words, valid documents must be parseable, even if some
valid documents don't parse according to the DTD in the spec.

Even better would be to set up a regular review cycle so that 
extensions to the spec's DTD can be folded into it as they
prove useful.

Perhaps an HTML+ tag

<!ELEMENT EXTENSION - - #PCDATA -- extensions > <!ATTLIST EXTENSION id
ID REQUIRED>

which is used in the HEAD as follows

<EXTENSION id="ncsa-anicon">NCSA ANICON tags to allow animated icons
in the text</EXTENSION>

Used basically as a way of describing and informally naming any
extensions to the DTD.  Browsers ignore them and their contents.
Whenever an extension is implemented, the DTD extension should be sent
to the mailing list and the extension discussed.

Sound reasonable?

With the small corrolary that if the above does happen that everyone is
nice about it. Not liking people because of the protocol quirk they support
is kind of silly. ;-)

(The above isn't meet as a slam on anyone. Just something I've observed
happen in computing in general: "I like DOS and you like UNIX therefore 
I don't like you, nyeah!")

Extension tags aren't the problem.  The only place we get into trouble is
in the interpertation of existing tags (like which tags nest, what does
white space mean, etc).  Once we can all agree upon the syntax and semantics
of the *defined* tags life will be much easier.

Subject: DTD extensions and modifications
Status: RO

Should there be one DTD only for HTML? What if my browser wants/knows
about/must have some elements that yours doesn't? What if I want to tag
my documents in some language other than English?  

Just for you to ponder, here are some of the ways in which the TEI has
handled these and related problems which have apparently been agitating
this list lately.

1. Renaming elements

All elements in the TEI dtd are declared indirectly. There is no element
declaration for an element called 'x'. Instead, there is an entity
declaration in the form <!ENTITY % n.x 'x' >  and 'x' is declared thusly
<!ELEMENT %n.x ....>. This means that if you, or your browser, want to
call this element 'z' instead, all you have to do is bung a
re-declaration for the n.x entity into the doctype subset of your
document <!ENTITY % n.x 'z'>

2. Adding new elements

All(most) elements in the TEI dtd are assigned to a class, depending
on whereabouts in a document they can appear. For example, there is a
class of 'phrase' level elements, which can only appear within
paragraphs or other chunks of text, never independently of them.
Corresponding with each class there is a parameter entity %x.class
initially null, which can be redefined by the user to add new members
into the class.

3. Removing existing elements

Every element declaration in the TEI dtd is bracketed by a marked
section named for the element itself, the value of which is by default
'include' but which can be changed to 'ignore' in the DTD subset. So, to
remove the current definition for 'blort' (either because you don't want
to allow blorts or because you want to substitute your own definition
for them -- not a good idea, but it happens --)  you just bung a 
<!ENTITY blort 'IGNORE'> into your dtd subset and kiss those blorts
goodbye (sorry Sebastian)

4. Combining/removing tagsets

Every elements in the TEI dtd is defined in one  'tagset' or dtd
fragment. There are two core tagsets which contain definitions for
elements likely to be needed in almost every kind of document and for
the TEI header; plus about a dozen others, for the most part
characteristic of particular types of text (e.g. verse) or applications
(e.g. hypertext). There are some rules about how they can be mixed and
matched which I won't detail here: the basic principle is simple enough
though -- it works in the same way as (3) above. If you want to
combine elements from tagsets foo and tagset blah, you will put two
appropriate entity declarations into your dtd subset, and magically all
and only those elements are enabled.

For more detail, probably much more than anyone needs, read chapter 3
(ST) of the TEI Guidelines. 

I hate seeing wheels re-invented, don't you? Especially if the
re-invention is a bit wonky...

There CAN be only one DTD for HTML+ (forget about HTML, that's frozen)

Write an extension to the DTD.

Why?  tags are markup, not content.  
 
[TEI stuff, all appropriate for TEI but not really needed here:] 
 > All elements in the TEI dtd are declared indirectly. 
 
This is only indirection, with provision for extension.  It 
doesn't mean having multiple DTDs.

 > All(most) elements in the TEI dtd are assigned to a class, ...

This is about restricting contents to particular contexts, coming
in HTML+.

Sure, you can cut down your HTML+ DTD; that won't hurt anything.  You
don't need the TEI method to accomplish that.

A way to encourage modifications; why do we need this for HTML+?

I am currently attempting to 'mark up' design standards to be utilized
by specialized browsers to provide standards information to both users
and applications.  

I find that HTML+ provides most of what I need, in the way of
functionality, however the attributes that are defined for tags do not
completely cover the required functionality.  I have therefore, in the
style of MIME, created a number of 'x-' attributes, which when
detected by 'smart standard' browers will provide the functionality
that is required.

It occured to me that 'ordinary' browsers could provide most of the
functionality if there was a method to instruct the browser to
interpret the 'x-' attributes as standard defined attributes.  

I would suggest then that a 'ALIAS' entity be added to the HTML+ RFC
to allow for authors to indicate that document type specific 
extended attributes could be interpreted as defined attributes with 
some possible degradation in functionality.  

For example I have used an X-CLASSIFIER attribute on headers that is
functionally almost the same as INDEX but with some minor variances.
It would be helpful if at the start of the document to include the
statement <ALIAS INDEX X-CLASSIFIER> to allow standard browsers to use
the classifiers as an index.

The ALIAS function would allow documents that are marked up in a
specific format to be viewed by non-specific browsers and as such
extend the distribution of information.

I want to know how a directory is displayed where I noticed from the

Do I have to use gopher in order to get the "Select one of:" message

With huge spaces everywhere.....

Which is the "correct" way of handling white space.

Note that if these types are defined as subtypes of text, you must be
careful to generated restricted definitions of them so that they do not
include pic or tbl (on the troff side), or other non-textual items.  In
general, I think they are better defined as subtypes of 'application',
not of 'text'.  The general discussion on the MIME list is wondering
whether there is any really appropriate subtype of 'text' besides
'plain'.  The experience with non-MIME readers encountering richtext,
and displaying it as 'text', has not been overwhelmingly positive.

An excellent idea.  I have done the same thing with texinfo, extending
it with macro definitions (really, just Fred's aliases) to form 'tim'. 
It allows one to explicitly use tags that chosen for the particular
application domain being documented, and therefore preserve that
information, but allows formatters ignorant of that domain to still do
reasonable things when transforming the document to a fixed state (such
as Postscript).

One point to note:  It is useful to have a standard tag, in the base
DTD, that fades away to nothing upon interpretation

  This <ignoreThisMarkup>would be</ignoreThisMarkup> an example.

This allows creation of domain-specific aliases which are used purely
for informational purposes, and that should have no effect on the
formatting.

The Correct way of handling spaces was not really decided upon until
just before and at the WWW conference.   Everyone agreed at that point
that all whitespace would be collapsed.  The newest version of Lynx
will do this, and I will modify the linemode browser and send the diffs
to Tim Berners-Lee as well.

Thank you for the support on the ALIAS idea

With regards to the idea of ignored tags in HTML+ the Internet draft,
by David Raggett (dsr@hplb.hpl.com) dated July 1993, states on page 4
'Notes to Implementors' that unknown tags should be simply ignored.

This ignoring of `unknown' tags should fit nicely into your
requirements.

It was also indicated, in an earlier mail message to www-talk, that
unknown attributes of known tags will also be ignored.

My apologies for taking up web space with a personal request, but I'm getting 
a bit desperate.

Like Dave, I also need to unsubscribe from www-talk.  The mailer daemon 
(listserv@info.cern.ch) can't find either of my e-mail addresses 
(pbertran@library.berkeley.edu and pbertran@lionheart.berkeley.edu) and 
www-request@info.cern.ch (supposedly an account monitored by a human) has not 
responded to my request sent 10 days ago.  Is www-request on vacation?  or 
does someone else have another suggestion?  Thanks

I do agree that certain formats are not understandable unless they are
rendered.  My comments are based on the Mail to www-talk by Tony
Sanders ( sanders@bsdi.com ) dated Aug 11/1993 `MIME Types for HTTP'
which had included richtext and HTTP within the text type but
allocated TeX and LaTex to the application type.

It seems to me that because both TeX and LaTex contain the entire
readable text, bounded by formatting, as does HTTP and richtext that
the intent of the document could be derived even if it was not
rendered.

PS: I have CCed www-talk with both my last message and this one
however it does not seem to be echoed to the discussion group.  Do you
know if this is a proper or should I just post directly to www-talk
only.

Version 0.7 of my man2html conversion program is now available as:

  ftp.vifp.monash.edu.au:/pub/src/infosystems/www/man2html0.7.tar.gz

The following changes have been made since version 0.6:

  Generated links are now "quoted"
  Generated links are now relative, unless $hostname and $port are defined
  Handling of <, >, and & are cleaned up
  Fonts are now <i>, <b>, rather than <HP1>, <HP2>
  Fonts are now more generalised
  Headings are now more generalised
  Pagebreaks no longer occur within the output HTML, there's still a
    <P> there though :-(
  Removed html.cc and related files - they weren't used


--- from the README

What is man2html?

  The scripts and files contained in this distribution are used at our
  site to convert Unix-style manual pages from their nroff form to a
  html, so that they can be displayed with a World Wide Web (WWW, or W3)
  browser.

What is it good for?

  I use it as part of our internal documentation system.   Most of our
  documentation is in HTML. I use it so I can point users to manual
  pages, and not have to pick out huge sections of the system manuals
  and put them in our documentation.

What does it run on?

  I have tested it on SunOS 4.1.2, and nothing else.  I'm happy to hear
  success stories about other systems that it works on, but probably
  can't spend much time getting it working on systems that it doesn't
  work on.

What else do I need?

  To use this package, you must have the groff package from a gnu
  archive site.  You must also have the Perl package from Larry Wall.
  This can be found at any site archiving comp.sources.misc.  The
  version I used was 4.0.36,

have fun,
rik.

          This still does not allow for questions like `is
this image part of another' or `is this audio segment contained in
this document'.  Now this may seem that these requests
may be a little out of the ordinary however I feel that the definition
of HTTP/V1.0 should not restrict these types of searches.  If, as
suggested, the TEXTSEARCH ( which should be renamed SEARCH ) is
implemented as a request method, utilizing the data portion of the
request to define the search, there would be no restrictions on the
searching capabilities of HTTP/V1.0.  It would be entirely up to the
client and server capabilities.

I've sent *four* requests to www-talk-request@info.cern.ch over the past
week or so asking to be dropped from the list.  None of them have been
returned as undeliverable, so I have to assume they are sitting, unread, in
some mailbox somewhere.  Like Penny, I'm getting rather annoyed and
frustrated.  The volume of mail (especially when it comes in duplicate and
triplicate) is overwhelming, and based on the responses I've gotten, it
doesn't look like anybody is driving.  Can somebody please do whatever is
needed to get me off the mailing list.  Thanks.

As I say, the experiments with richtext have not been uniformly
applauded by people with naive mail-readers.  There's no reason to
suppose that text/HTML would do any better (worse, probably, because
more of the semantics of the document are contained in the mark-up).

Yes, but this is not sufficient criteria to place it under 'text'. 
Postscript, after all, or a GIF image of the printed page, contains
enough information that the intent of the document *could* be derived
even if it is not rendered.  It just may be arbitrarily difficult.

Status: RO

Does 'ignoring' mean "treat as if they were not there" or "do not
interpret as tags"? My guess is the former. The latter has the advantage
that useful information can be still presented to the user -- for
example, if my document uses some semantic tagging which a particularly
dim browser doesn't know about. 

Both options  will of course deeply confuse browsers trying to
calculate byte offsets within a file.

WWWWW comments on the current version of the HTML+ spec.
-------------------------------------------------------

In Tony Sanders' reply to Steve Heaney, Tony ends up with:

Here is a list of presentation features in HTML+ along with my feelings
for what might be done to improve things.

Headers:

The margin attribute in headers signifying that the header should be left
justified in the left margin.

Emphasis:

This is perhaps overloaded, and too far over in the direction of brevity.

    b           bold
    i           italic
    u           underline
    s           strikethru  (a newcomer)
    tt          fix pitch font
    tr          serif font
    hv          sans serif font
    sup         superscript
    sub         subscript

**** I am thinking about having superscript and subscript as separate tags.
**** Also to use a face=serif {serif, sans, fixed) for font face for which
**** the choices are mutually exclusive

Paragraphs:

    align       left, center or right
    indent      (missing an ability to specify the level)

**** how about allowing indent=3 to indicate the level of indentation.
**** Or perhaps indent=none (default), {same, more, less} ?

Preformatted text:

    tr          serif font
    hv          sans serif font
    width       optimisation for selecting font size

    tabs        an element to make it easier to import
                documents in other formats, e.g. man pages

**** treat fonts in same way as emphasis. Preformatted text exists in HTML
**** only because there is no other suitable external format, supporting links

Ordered Lists:

    compact     this attribute implies a more compact form of list

**** Perhaps we ought to copy DocBook's rendering hints for selecting
**** numbers, roman numerals, upper or lower case letters ?

Unordered Lists:

    compact     this attribute implies a more compact form of list
    narrow      suggests list can be arranged in multiple columns

**** I would like to copy DocBook's feature for allowing you to specify
**** how multicolumn lists wrap horizontally or vertically. Perhaps
**** This is better handled with a new tag for simple lists <list wrap=vert>

Definition Lists:

    compact     this attribute implies a more compact form of list

**** These should be nestable within other lists according to popular appeal.

Tables:

    align       left, center or right (for cell titles or data)

    <TB>        inserts 1/2 line space into next row (to be dropped?)

**** Drop TB due to lack of interest. Some people feel that the current model
**** for tables will give poor performance. This is to be tested
**** experimentally to see if there is strong enough need for additional
**** formatting information

Figures:

    align       position of figure relative to text: left, center or right
    cap         caption at left, right, top, bottom
    noflow      allows you to disable text flow

**** Note that this align attribute is different from IMG. One acts
**** horizontally, the other vertically! I will think over the idea to
**** use IMG for specifying images in figures with this in mind.

Figure overlay (FIGT)

    at          the position of the upper corner relative to the picture
    width       what fraction of the picture the overlay should take up
    framed      whether the overlay should be framed or not

**** The width attribute should perhaps be generalised to specify both
**** width and height intentions for the overlay.

Inlined images:

    align       vertical position relative to current text line

**** Note the difference from the same named attribute for figures.

Generic containers (GROUP)

    inset       inflexible hint to inset margins

**** This should be changed in line with that for paragraphs
**** The spec will be changed to explain this element in more detail

Hypertext links:

    effect      how to deal with the referenced node: replace/new/overlay
    type        for presentation cues
    size        for progress cues

**** The overhaul of the attributes for links and the new powerful model
**** for implicit and explicit links plus support for multi-node documents
**** should go a long way to meeting many peoples' needs.

Dave Raggett

Lou,

The HTML DTD is well specified, the only problem is that few people bother
to read it! I have posted a solution months ago:

ALL browsers should tell you if the document you are reading doesn't conform
to the DTD. A good browser would then allow you to view a detailed report
showing where the problems occur and suggesting suitable fixes. This can
be implemented as a separate process which takes a document on stdin and
returns an HTML doc containing the "lint" report.

Now who wants to write the HTML lint filter?

Dave

This is a problem for existing word processors, such as Word for Windows.
Usually markup (e.g. font selection) doesn't include the white space
following the last word to which the markup applies.

The ability to show paragraph stops is a great help as it provides
visual cues to the presence of the paragraph markup info.

For simple markup like font changes (e.g. emphasis) the editor is
responsible for inserting the necessary begin and end elements as
needed to make the result legal. More complex selections across
say table boundaries are also patched up by Word for Windows, so
why can't we do the same?

Sound like the job for a menu. The end of the edit menu could show
the current levels of markup, and allow you to select the whole lot 
at one go!

The basic lesson here is to adopt the solutions used by the
best wysiwyg word processors. Keep thinking up the questions - they
seem an excellent way to develop guidelines for designers.

Dave Raggett

BTW I have been thinking on similar lines, but just don't have the time
right now to implement an HTML+ wysiwyg editor. Maybe in the winter ...

Dave,

It is interesting what you have to say about the browser validating the 
HTML documents it displays.

I agree (obviously) that documents should be validated.  However, you 
are suggesting that this should be done via the browser.  This seems to 
be more related to the authoring task.  A browser user can do nothing 
about a non-conforming document unless they are also the owner.

Additionally, it would be a waste of effort for an HTML "lint" to be 
developed.  There are a several public domain SGML parsers available and 
these should be used to perform document validation.

Regards,

Steve.

The answer can be looked for in Charles Goldfarb's SGML Handbook.

You can declare an entity reference to an external SGML file and then
"include" it. You can also make references to data stored in an external
format using the NONSGML and NOTATION keywords. There are mechanisms for
"public" identifiers (similar to URNs but run by the ISO and probably
unsuitable for widespread use in the Internet), and "system" identifiers
supposedly for local files. The "proper" SGML approach forces you to declare
all such references and to then use local names in subsequent markup. HTML of
course flouts this by including the URL directly in the elements defining
hypertext links.

In general SGML is quite a weak specification language, and not as good
as simple BNF grammar formalisms. The supposed ability to use common SGML
parsers to interchange document formats is dependent on the formats involved
having closely matching semantic models. The SGML standard makes some
provision for including procedural information but this is not present in
the DTD's for each format. In other words, you still need to write a "program"
to relate features in each format.

Why do you think ISO public identifiers are unsuitable for widespread
use in the Internet? Is this a case of "not invented here"?

This is simply meaningless. Not as good in what respect? Weak with
respect to what?

>The supposed ability to use common SGML parsers to interchange document

SGML is not about interchange of formats, but about interchange of
document structure. The fact that HTML+ cannot distinguish these
fundamentally different properties of a text is the strongest argument
against its widespread adoption and the basic cause of the endless
confusion evident throughout recent discussion of it.

> The SGML standard makes some provision for including procedural
>information but this is not present in the DTD's for each format. 

The SGML standard allows you to associate procedural information with
parts of the document structure within a given dtd if you really want
to (using so-called "processing instructions" is one way; using Linkset
declarations is another). Most people would prefer that all such
information should be standardized in a separate document or database
entirely, using the new ISO 'Document Style Semantics Specification
Language' (DSSSL).

And while I'm being obnoxious: the plural of "DTD" is "DTDs"

Thanks for pointing this out. The HTML+ spec is not yet an official
Internet draft, although we hope it will become one soon. before that
can happen, I am going to have to redraft parts of it to take into
account feedback from the recent workshop and from other people who
couldn't attend.

text/richtext is an official MIME type so we have no choice.

Anything that's not official MIME is arbitrary as far as I'm
concerned.  Most browsers will probably end up trying to display
anything they don't understand in plaintext anyway.

I would be happy to move text/html to application/html
if we agree that's where it should go (which is really up
to the MIME people since the plan is to register it as an
official type).  The reason I put it under text/ is because
it looks a lot like richtext.  The reason I put TeX and
troff under application is because I've seen other people
use them that way.

Where does this "should" come from?

This is a message pertaining to the WWW Library.  If you arn't using
the library or are not familiar with it, just ignore it.


In HTInit.c there are ways to set up the stream type for FTP using
file extensions.  Using HTSetSuffix the stream type can be defined
as binary, 7-bit, or 8-bit.  This is good!  What isn't good is that
there is no way to specify the stream type for HTTP file transferes.
HTSetConversion allows you to set the procedure used for the conversion
but says nothing about whether to transfer the file in binary, 7-bit or
8-bit.  I think some other routine needs to be created to specify
uniquely the transfer type for each MIME type.  Seperate this designation
from HTSetSuffix and specify globaly the transfer type for each content
type.  I suggest HTSetTransferType with minimum arguments of
MIME_TYPE and TRANSFER_TYPE, where MIME_TYPE is any mime type and
TRANSFER_TYPE is one of binary, 7-bit, or 8-bit.

I don't understand how this addresses the problem
of delivering a large hierarchical document in HTML+
chunks.  Are you suggesting that I create a "master"
document that contains entity references to the nested
sections, each of which could be in a separate file? If I
access the master document, would the entities be resolved
and all the content pulled in for viewing? (Do any HTTP
servers do that?) If so, that is the same as pulling across
the whole book.

Also, the external files would not each be parsable SGML,
right? They would be SGML fragments because their parent
section containers would be in the master file.  So they
couldn't be accessed directly.  I'm looking for random
access into pieces of a large document.

Nesting section containers is great when you are working
with the whole document.  But it seems less desirable
in a modular system like WWW.  SGML doesn't require
nesting section containers, although it is the most
common way of representing hierarchical information.
I'm hoping the hierarchical relationships between sections
can still be encoded in SGML, using a flatter style of
DTD like HTML.

I agree this sounds resonable.  Some may complain that [IMAGE] should
not be displayed at all, so if no ALT is given show nothing.
I think having [IMAGE] appear is better because there are alot of
existing documents that can't be viewed without some form of image
place holder, and having [IMAGE] come up in documents will help to
remind people to put in ALT's for their IMG tags.

Is there supposed to be a <UL compact>?  I heard someone mention
at the WWWWW that <UL compact> was supposed to be a list with no
bullets.  If there isn't a <UL compact> is there enough support
to add this?  Is <menu> supposed to be like a <UL compact>?

And what about Marc's (or someone's) suggestion to display a random
graphic instead of a bullet.  That's pretty easy to add.  If there
is an ALT attribute the user could also specify there favorite 
bullet character in text mode clients.

What happened to the LINK REL values for document redirections
(REL = Moved, Forward, etc)?

I really need to be able to return a document that causes
the browser to immediatly retrieve a different document.

e.g., the return document might say:

<HEAD><LINK REL="Forward" HREF="..."></HEAD>
<BODY>You shouldn't see <A HREF="...">this</A></BODY>

I could have sworn they used to be mentioned in the spec somewhere

It is mentioned in the HTTP/1.0 (or is that 2.0) spec.  Not quite in
that format however.  An error code is returned something like:

Moved 301
Location: <url> String CrLF

With "Location" passed as an rfc 822 header to the client.  The client is then
supposed to be smart enough to recognize the header and go get the 
alternate document.

Seems to me that <DL compact><DT><IMG ALT="o" ...><DD>xyz</DL>
should work pretty well for that.

[Lou points out that it's in HTTP/1.0 as]
> Moved 301
> Location: <url> String CrLF

Thanks, that's where I saw them, seems to me like they should be
<LINK> relationships as well.  Oh well, no biggie there (though
if there were corrisponding <LINK>'s HTTP/0.9 users could use
them also).

This is something you browser writers should think about
implementing (and should be handled in libwww).

That won't work quite right.  When you have an icon or bullet character
you want the text to be indented in front of the bullet like:

  * this is some text that has many words and will line
    wrap in many browsers with small window widths and
    resizeable terminals.

<DL compact><DT><IMG ALT="o"> etc...  will not necessarily be rendered
the way the author intended.  Don't quote me on this, but I don't
think <dl compact> will be rendered with the <dt> on the same line
as the <dd> in Xmosaic. (If I'm wrong I'm sorry, I'm at home and can't
get to my portable x-terminal)  We could specify explicitly (in the DTD)
that <DL compact> must render the <dt> on the same line as the <dd> when
space permits.  But barring that there is no way for an author to
be sure the <IMG> specified will appear as a bullet or a funny 
picture about the text.  Another problem with <DL compact> is that
there may be arbitrarily many spaces separating the <DT> from the
<dd>.  In the linemode browser for instance, the <dt> begins on
line 2 and the <dd> begins on line 30 or 40.  Which gives us a rendering
like this:

  *			this is some text that has many words
			and will wrap...

If we had a list structure explicitly defined NOT to have bullets
we could use it and <IMG> tags to show icon lists, but those lists
will not support line wrapping very well.  We would end up with
something like:

  * this is some text that has many words and will
  wrap ...

Which is probably alright for most people, but you haven't met
my editor :).

Until everyone is using full wysiwyg authoring tools, people are going
to continue using text editors. They then run the browser to check the
results - at this point the browser should inform them that they have
screwed the syntax! So the practical approach is for browsers to flag
whether documents conform or not to the DTD!

You seem to forget that the objective is to help users as much as possible.
A custom lint program for HTML would incorporate models of common misunder-
standings and can offer dramatically better feedback than a vanilla SGML
parser. Check out books on compiler technology, e.g. "Understanding and
Writing Compilers" by Bornat. The tough part of writing a compiler or lint
program is providing really useful feedback when the source file is wrong.

The former. The text between the opening and closing unknown tag is simply
passed on and rendered as if the unknown tag wasn't there.

Thank you for pointing out the ambiguity, I will clarify this in the spec.

Why? Perhaps your parser is too cavalier about throwing away information.
Mine always knows the current position of elements, its just cheaper to
avoid copying lots of text when you don't need to.

Status: RO

If you use GNU-emacs (and who doesn't?) to prepare your text files,
you can configure it to an SGML-aware mode with a set of declarations
available together with the excellent sgmls parser developed by James
Clark. This can be tweaked to do a lot of validation on the fly, and (of
course) invoke the parser on the text, in just the same way as you can
tweak emacs to run lint (etc) for you on other kinds of document.

This combination would enable you to make sure your document was at
least syntactically valid HTML, though whether it will look nice when
your browser gets at it is of course another question (enter one dead
horse, well flogged)

sgmls is available for anon ftp all over the place: I got my copy
from sgml1.ex.ac.uk

Status: RO

>SGML is poor in its capability to specify attributes, e.g. although SGML

>specify constraints on elements in those lists.

Sorry, but this is simply untrue. e.g.

  <!attlist foo bar (x|y|z) x>

states that the bar attribute on foo can take values x y or z,
defaulting to x.

You can also constrain an attribute value to be a name token, a name, an
idref or a list of any of those things.

That's about it for constraints though. Several people would probably
agree that SGML is relatively under-endowed with features
(feature-challenged?) for constraining attribute values -- some have
even gone so far as to say that you shouldn't use attributes at all,
since formally there's no obvious way of distinguishing
  <thing foo=bar> .... </thing> 
  <thing><foo>bar</foo> .... </thing>

> Similarly you can't
> constrain combinations of values of different attributes for each tag.

This is true, in the sense that you cannot say "if the bar value is x
then the ping value must be q". There is a (rather annoying) constraint
which says that the values specified as legal for *all* attributes of a
given element must be disjoint, i.e. you can't have two attributes on
the same element which both take values 'yes' or 'no'. 

>You also can't specify how deeply a given element can be nested. There is no
>notion of context to hang a constraint on.

Huh? What's a dtd do then? If I say 
<!element div0 - o (div1+)>
<!element div1 - o (div2+)>
<!element div2 - o (div3+)>
That seems to specify pretty exactly to me at what depth of nesting each
element can occur, and also provides some pretty detailed notions of
context.

If you mean that, given the definition

<!element div - o (#pcdata|div) >

there's no way of preventing infinite recursion, then no there isn't.
And a good thing too.  If you mean that there's no way of telling for a
given <div> occurrence how far down the tree you are, then no there
isn't, but you wouldn't expect to find such a thing in a grammar anyway
would you? You can (of course) define an attribute 'level' to do it for
you, if you anticipate a processor incapable of working it out.

We are in vehement agreement about this point. Its refusal to deal with
semantics is exactly why SGML is such a very successful and useful tool
-- it provides people with an interlingua for discussing the things
which matter to them.

You would break a "book" into a number of HTML+ nodes (files)
with a "contents" node that points to the others and so on
hierarchically as needed. Entities *wouldn't* be pulled across
as you describe. Instead the user is free to follow embedded
links (as now). You can also define navigational links for
properties such as"prev/next chapter", "table of contents"
and "glossary". These links may be defined explicitly or
implicitly as described in the HTML+ spec. The advantage of
implicit links is that they avoid having to insert links
into all the constituent nodes and further allow given nodes
to occur in more than one "book".

Wrong! The HTML+ spec ensures that each node can conform to
the DTD regardless of its position in the wider hierarchy.
So random access to nodes is OK.

Indeed they can.

HTML+ doesn't (yet) include <menu> or <dir>. There does need to be
a simple consistent way of specifying the same kinds of thing, e.g.

        <!ATTLIST UL
                src (%URL;)  #IMPLIED        -- image for bullet --
                compact (compact) #IMPLIED   -- suppress bullets --
                wrap (none|vert|horiz) none  -- multicolumn lists -->

e.g. <ul wrap=horiz> horizontally wrapped multicolumn list </ul>

I added this into later versions of the draft, although the alt attribute
arised later on and needs adding.

In the same vein, we need to think about ordered lists and allowing people
to specify the style, perhaps on the lines of the DocBook DTD.

There has been a deal of discussion about where formatting information 
should go, what formatting information can be defined etc.

One development, which I support, is the idea of a style sheet which is 
separate from the document but specifies its formatting.  Is this 
going to be part of the HTML+? If so, it obviously affects the HTML+ 
DTD in terms of the attributes that elements will take.

If it _is_ to be part of HTML+, the attributes that represent formatting 
hints need to be removed.  This would, to my mind, include the some of the 
attributes currently being discussed wrt list formatting.

On the subject of specifying formatting information, may I suggest that 
either DSSSL or FOSI form the basis of the specification, but that only 
those parts of these (large) standards that are required are used.  I 
see little point in reinventing the wheel, but it is obviously not 
desirable to implement either in their entirety.

Steve.

I agree that the current HTML and HTML+ are suitable for
breaking up a book into nodes as you describe, and we are
planning to do it that way. But HTML and HTML+ as currently
proposed have a flat, not nested, section structure. That
makes it is easy to break up the long stream into parsable
pieces for a modular file structure.

However, several people have suggested making sections
into containers that nest, as with the DocBook and
other DTDs. My question was: if that happens, how
would large books be broken up into modular files?
Having not received a good answer, I will argue to
keep the current flat DTD structure as you have
proposed in HTML+.

A more practical approach is to have a single HTML-lint (whether
that's sgmls + DTD or a smaller and simpler program is beside the
point) that does this for them.  Many of the browser writers have
their hands full simply trying to support the browsers as browsers,
not pseudo-authoring tools.

Marc, with respect, your browser puts out a lot of error messages.
What's so hard about reporting that the document is marked up
incorrectly---even if you don't report all SGML errors?

For example, I recently found that one of our editors, an 
experienced typographer, had created a set of heads that
looked like this:

        <H2>foo</H3>

Because they looked okay in Xmosaic, she didn't bother to
parse the document.  But she had an illegal, ambiguous,
construction.  Can't your parser tell when it hits something
like this?  

Even something so simple as "Markup error in [URL]" would
help, because you could go and parse the file with sgmls to
find the error.

Of course, it is good practice for publishers (that means all
of us if we put up files at our sites) always to parse their
files before archiving them.

Clearly Mosaic's fault.  I can smell it coming.......

........and there it is.

Why can't the document be validated via standard validation
mechanisms?  Why must the display mechanism be overloaded as the
authoring mechanism as well?

OK, this is confusing me.  When I'm at O'Reilly I meet people who tell
me, wow, Mosaic is wonderful, it handles anything you throw at it
without complaining, it's the most robust thing I've ever seen (as
close to verbatim as I can remember).  Now, someone else from O'Reilly
is telling me the exact opposite.  Huh???

> Of course, it is good practice for publishers (that means all of us

Yup!

Folks, don't complain to us because Mosaic is robust.  Come on.

For the record: the really big reason Mosaic does not report errors
and will not in the forseeable future is because DOING SO WOULD
REQUIRE WORK and we have our hands full doing other, more important
things (better widgetry and HTML+, fill-out forms, HTTP/1.0 and WAIS,
bugfixes, support, etc.).  The other reason, which isn't even coming
into play because of the first reason but which otherwise would, is
that Mosaic is a browsing environment, not an authoring tool.

This, to me, looks like a prime opportunity for O'Reilly to put one of
its people on writing, distributing, and supporting a small,
efficient, and user-friendly HTML-lint.

No lint is needed; we have a DTD.  That's supposed to be our
interface between documents and browsers.  If you don't want to
report errors, well, we'll have to live with that.  But if you
aren't planning on using the HTML+ DTD as an interface with us
document editors, please tell us now.  

We've gotta know when our docs are valid without running them 
through every parser.  Our mechanism for doing that is SGML, with
all its warts.  

Perhaps I have a beta version, but I often get messages about
characters my terminal can't render (that's what I meant by
error messages).  

I'm sure I'm not alone now in wondering how your browser deals
with markup, Marc.  Can you give us a brief description?

I don't understand this.

Show me an HTML document that conforms to the DTD that Mosaic does not
handle correctly, and it will be a bug and we will fix it.

When we implement HTML+ support, show me an HTML+ document that
conforms to the DTD that Mosaic does not handle correctly, and it will
also be a bug and we will fix it.

In your role as a creator of valid HTML documents with DTD in hand,
what problems can you possibly have with this situation?  What are we
doing wrong?

That's Motif and your X font set.

I don't understand the question.  It parses valid HTML and displays
it, properly.

Really a browser should handle "bad" html in any way the author see's fit.
Garbage In, Garbage Out No?  As long as a browser can parse, and properly
display valid HTML (HTML+) the browser does as it should, and there should be
no complaints.  In fact browsers that dont barf and dump core on bad HTML is a
good thing!  Why should Mosaic (or any browser) inform users of bad HTML?  As
someone who is using the web (not creating documents) I dont want to see error
messages when the browser is parsing "bad" html.  I dont care.  The author is
the one responsible for good HTML, and as such should have tools such as an
html-lint available to them.  However, "lint" inside a HTML browser is
uneccesary, and from a user point of view, unwanted.

Does anyone have a really slick, fairly small color icon suitable for
representing sound clips?  A full-color human ear or something like
that...?

Be kinda neat to have an online exhibit of the best icons known to
humankind, in hypermedia form, available for downloading.  Anyone got
any free time?  :-)

I have some searchable indexes in gopherspace which I'd like to make
look nice in World Wide Web.  By "look nice" I mostly mean
to make some screen with "<ISINDEX>" that tells me something
about the database, what some good searches are, maybe links
to particular options etc.

The first thing that comes to mind is to wrap a simple little
gopher client into a module for the "plexus" server, and launch
the queries that way.   But rather than write code, does anyone
have a good way to have documents that support "Search Keyword"
really send the query off to another server?

Three problems with info.cern.ch since beginning of last week:

1- info disk full
2- duplicated mail
3- inability to unsubscribe

1- disk full:
The disk of the info.cern.ch machine was full.
Because of the setup (security, NeXT unusual here, ...) and some  
problems elesewhere on the CERN site, it took some time to make  
progress.
The disk is no longer full, and though I suspect that the mail  
duplication problem and the unsubscribe problem was due to this, I am  
not sure.

2- duplicated mail:
If you see mail duplicated again, please DO NOT react so as to avoid  
an avalanche. I will rely on two individuals to bring this to my  
attention through mail sent directly and only to me: Tony Sanders and  
Marc Andreessen. I have consulted the local e-mail supervisers who  
are diagnosing the phenomenon.

3- Those of you who want to unsubscribe from www-talk, I have  
consulted the local experts and I have a list of names to be removed.  
Be patient, we work on it, and apologize for the inconvenience.

You may be happy to know that I have before me a Mosaic running a
quite revised HTML widget, thanks to Eric's kamikaze work ethic, that
includes the following features:

<UL>
<LI> No more document pages or large virtual windows -- everything is
     managed by the widget itself (including scrollbars).
<LI> Preformatted text sections wider than window do not force
     all text to be formatted to full width of window; text will be
     formatted to width of visible window and horizontal scrollbar
     will allow viewing remainder of the pre sections.
<LI> Jumping to anchor in document in new window (e.g. using middle
     button) now works.
<LI> Performance performance performance!  (Really!)
</UL>

(BTW, this also means that putting widgets -- e.g., Motif text entry
fields, etc. -- inside the HTML widget suddenly got a lot simpler and
therefore should be arriving soon.  Of course, Eric's still gotta do
all the work, so I'd *hate* to overpromise and thereby put him under a
lot of pressure, which always makes him work really hard... :-)

In addition to Eric, I'd like to thank my mother, Roy Buchanan,
Johannes Brahms, Cariann and Amy at Espresso Royale, Pepperidge Farm,
J. Crew, Smith Barney Hutton Shearson Lehman Brothers And Sisters,
Mystery Science Theatre 3000, the State of Idaho, and Bill Clinton for

If anybody is interested in taking up Marc's offer, Anthony's X
Icon Library might be a good starting point. The address is:

ftp://export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib/AIcons/

Here are some extracts from the README file:
____________________________________________


                  Anthony's X Icon Library (version 1.3)
                ------------------------------------------
                       EMail: anthony@cit.gu.edu.au

  This collection was developed from the need for a collection of small
bitmaps for both programming and X application icons. The library is
freely copyable and can be used for any purpose you may desire.  I would
appreciate any new icons you may like to add to this collection and thay
can be e-mail'ed to the above address.

The sub-directorys are :-

   std         Icons (xbm) that are all 64x54 in size. This is to allow
               X window screen displays to have all its application icons
               the same size. Some of these icons represent particular
               machines on the Giffith University network.  These icons
               are placed in the directory "/usr/include/X11/bitmaps/std"
               at this site. See also "README.xrdb" and README.twmrc.

   bw-32       Black & White icons that are all 32x32 in size.
   bw-48       Black & White icons that are all 48x48 in size.
   bw-64       Black & White icons that are all 64x64 in size.
   bw-misc     Black & White icons of miscellanous size.
   bw-bgnd     Large(ish) background tile patterns (IE: escher fish tile).
   bw-pats     Small scale texture patterns (IE: GreyScale or root_weave).

   cl-32       Color icons which are 32x32 pixels in size. (a large collection)
   cl-48       Color icons which are 48x48 pixels in size. (only 2 icons)
   cl-64       Color icons which are 64x64 pixels in size. (no icons - yet)
   cl-misc     Color icons of miscellanous sizes.
   cl-bgnd     Color background tiles. (NOTE: these are in gif format)

   gr-misc     Miscellanous sized grey-scale icons. (only 2 at this time)

   button      Small symbols or pictures used for buttons and markers.
                 Usually 16x16 but not always.

   cursor      Small cursors and associated masks  (ie: watch & gumby )

   twm         Small set of icons for use as part of the TWM window manager
               title bar display. The number in the icon name refers to
               the 75dpi font point size that is used within the title
               bar. (Box size - 1) (See "README.twm" file)

   prog        A collection of icons that would probably only be used in
               specific programs. This includes icons for landscapes,
               `planview' type adventure games (EG: Ultima, Nethack),
               Drawing programs, and assorted miscellanous controls.
               This is a `catch-all' directory of icons with specific
               purposes. See the README.prog file in this archieve.

   mail        Icons for showing the status of mail (xbiff & xmail progs)
                  *_new.xbm   for new mail just arrived
                  *_none.xbm  for no mail in mail box (or no new mail)
                  *_old.xbm   for only old mail in mail box (hardly used)
                  *_mask.xbm  for mask shaped windows (ie: xbiff)

   docs        Icons for file managers and browsers (eg: like `xdtm' )
   flags       A collection of country flags from around the globe
   movies      Icons that form an animation sequence of some sort

   bits        Bits & Pieaces which are not relly complete icons in
                 themselves but can be used to create new icons to decorate
                 applications. (IE: flowers, animals, balls, pipes)

Lou, your example is *not* a list attribute! According to Goldfarb, lists
can be defined as id reference lists, name lists, name token lists, number
lists, and number token lists. You can't specify the domain of list items
in any further detail!

 ... various amplifications deleted ...

This is futile. I would have loved to quote the page references for all
my points, but Goldfarb makes this a mammoth job due to the appaulingly
bad index. (Oh I wish I could get myself to scribble on my copy, but old
habits die hard ...)

Unfortunately without semantics you *can't* convert meaningfully between
different syntaxes!

IMHO the merit of SGML is that it provides a common basis for defining the
syntax of different document formats. This common basis makes it much easier
to extend parsers to handle new semantics since the syntax part is already
done for you via the DTD. There is no magic - you still have to write the
code to handle the semantics yourself. This effort will be diminished by
new standards such as DSSSL and ODA which provide a common framework for
rendering documents.

I can think of one approach which would work efficiently.

Lets assume that each section is defined something like:

        <SECTION>
           <H> this section's header </H>
                <SECTION>
                    <H> a subsection header </H>
                </SECTION>
        </SECTION>

First consider the case where a node is browsed independently of
other nodes. The style preferences define how to render the top
level header, and so on for each nested section.

Now if the node is considered as being part of a "book", the starting
level for the node can be defined by the context. As you traverse the
nodes that form the book, the browser keeps track of the level.

In many ways this is like the notion of context dependent navigation
links for table of contents, glossary etc. You could use an element
at the start of a node to define the starting level, or rely on
browsers propagating this property on the fly. The latter could even
be allowed to override the former, which is then treated as a default.

Personally, I prefer the explicit style in HTML and HTML+.

Hm.. two things come to my mind here. First of all, I do agree
that having containers for sections would be a very useful thing.
If these sections were given attributes, like
        <SECTION role="Abstract">
          foo bar gronk ...
        </SECTION> 

a retrieval system would be able to handle requests like "give me 

all documents that contain the term 'compression' in the Abstract".
This would be a further step towards intergrating more text database 

functionality into the Web.

Secondly, I noticed that HTML+ defines a markup called <GROUP>,
which is intended to serve as a container for text sections. Am I
missing something, or is this basically the same as the <SECTION>
that Dave has proposed? Will group have some unique id that a
text database could refer to?

Cheers,
Chris

A while ago I said I would do this, and I've finally gotten around to doing
an initial implementation.

<a href="http://opus.mit.edu:8001/talkindex">The index</a> is very simple
minded and will probably remain that way.  The search string will search the
last 100 messages to www-talk and present them in a list.  If you want to
search more or less than 100 messages, make the last space separated word
of your search the number of messages you want to search.  That is:

sgml		/* search last 100 transactions for 'sgml' */
sgml 50		/* search last 50 transactions for 'sgml' */

There is one problem with this index.  It is slow.  It's really slow.
Pretty much, there's nothing I can do about it because the software that I
built it on top of is where the slowness comes from.  If I come up with a
better solution, I'll get to it.

Unfortunately, the index also gets bitten by the conversion of spaces to
'+'s.  For example, a search of html+ will yeild the same as a search of
html because I just translate all +'s into spaces.

The opus.mit.edu location is temporary, so in the future, you will want to use
www.mit.edu:8001, but we are in the middle of moving services from one
one machine to another.  Hopefully the switch over will take place in about
a week.

Any problems should be sent to webmaster@athena.mit.edu.  Enjoy.

Has anyone bashed together a world wide web interface to snmp?
There were some early efforts to do such a thing for gopher,
e.g. Roland Schemer's work using the "tricklet" libraries
under the "go4gw" script, but I don't recall anything recent here.

Armed with the right set of icons you should be able to do a 
pretty convincing "check the network" page.

From: Edward Vielmetti <emv@garnet.msen.com>
Status: RO

I'm using "mpeg_play" to display my mpeg movies.  (Just tried the
3d rotating skulls from NCSA, pretty snappy.)  It seems to work,
tho it's real minimalist as a viewer.

If anyone has a "nice" mpeg viewer, e.g. one that lets you do
 - single step or freeze frame
 - looping and reverse
 - save individual images to files
 - anything else you might reasonably expect from a low priced VCR
I'd like to hear about it.

In the interim, for people on middlingly slow lines, it would be good
to have the default command executed be not 
	mpeg_play
but	mpeg_play -loop
so that you at least get a chance to keep the thing around once you
have spent the time downloading it.

Subject: DSSSL and/or FOSI references, tutorials
Status: RO

The was a request for information regarding the DSSSL and FOSI standards a 
few days ago.  A similar question was posed on the comp.text.sgml list 
(see below) which I've included for your information.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no information on DSSSL freely available.  
It is still in draft - ISO/IEC DIS (Draft International Standard) 10179.  It is mentioned in the bibliography by Robin Cover at the following site.  The FOSI 
standard is available from ftp.ifi.uio.no in /pub/SGML/CALS.  It is in the form 
of a specification though - not all that easy to read.

Whilst I havn't seen the August version of <TAG> yet, I would imagine 
that this would be the best place to start re information about FOSI if you 
can lay your hands on a copy.

Steve Heaney.

I support Marc completely in his decision to make Mosaic
work as best it can when it is given invalid HTML.  The
maxim is that one should be
	- conservative in what one does
	- liberal in what one expects.

In other words, generate good HTML and expect nothing.

When Terry says the DTD is the basis for chaking HTML,
he means you can get SGMLS, concatenate the DTD in the
spoec with any HTML document, and run it through SGMLS
to get a list of errors.

That is the author's job. We have considered making a
"policeman" program to do it all over the web and mail
or throw rotten eggs at authors, but we are not in
a position to do it yet!  Arthur
Secret has been checking our directory space for bad files
and opening them and re-saving them with the NeXT editor
(WorldWideWeb app) to fix them.  This will only work where the
editor's liberal interpretation was correct, but it will
certainly cure files written with old versions of the same
editor.

No lint is needed; we have a DTD.  That's supposed to be our
interface between documents and browsers.  If you don't want to
report errors, well, we'll have to live with that.  But if you
aren't planning on using the HTML+ DTD as an interface with us
document editors, please tell us now.

Does anyone actually use the future list ("where you can go") in
Mosaic's history window?  In particular, is there any point in having
it, given the new mouse-tracking method of discovering what's at the
other end of an anchor in 2.0?  Responses straight to me, please...

(BTW, to the people who don't like the mouse tracking: [a] the default
in the real 2.0 release will be to tell the user real information
about what's on the other end of the link, as opposed to the URL, and
[b] it will always be possible to turn it off.)

Thanks,
Marc

Subject: annotation server usage
X-Md4-Signature: 5bc5303d547f23ed8a35831cc080547d
Status: RO

I've been promising multiple group annotation server support with a
corresponding GUI in Mosaic 2.0.  But, with recent developments in how
we think about annotations (in particular, the coming "public"
annotation a.k.a. document-server-side functionality), I'm wondering
how many people will actually want to have more than one group
annotation server at any time (on top of the public annotation
support), at least over the next year or two.

If I just provide a toggle to set whether or not group annotations are
fetched for a single group annotation server, rather than a full-blown
multiple group annotation server GUI, is there anyone who thinks this
would have a impact on how they plan to use 2.0?

Reponses straight to me, please.

(The reason I'm asking most of these questions to www-talk from time
to time is because I'm trying to keep/make the overall program
interface non-complex, and keep/make everyone happy... :-)

Also, anyone try out the simpleInterface resource in the latest 2.0
prerelease?  There seemed to be a lot of interest in such a feature,
but then nobody's said anything since I put it out...

Thanks much,
Marc

I just added an icon with an ear and some musical notes.  It could
use some work.

There are currently 10 icons on that page (all 64x64).  If anyone has
interesting icons please send them to me and I'll add them to the page.

I just talked to someone at WordPerfect who said that the dtd should work
but that we would have to 'group` some of the stuff together in order to 
get some of the quantity statements to work with their system imposed
limits. I personally don't know enough about SGML to have the slightest clue
what he was talking about (hell, I'm having to learn perl just to munge stuff
so I can get other things on the web). Does anyone out there know what he
is talking about enough to fix the dtd?

I'm even willing to donate an account on my machine for anyone that can
help me get the dtd working with Intellitag. That, MacTCP's 12k leak, and 
Cello and/or PCMosaic are the 3 things keeping me from shutting down
every gopher server on campus in favor of a web server.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

After a recent announcement from Les Cottrell re: China networking info
in the SLAC SCS page, I've been exploring the information available there.
I've run into a few problems or annoyances.

1)  SCS not accessible offsite.  As Les has explained to me, the SCS stuff
contains some SLAC-proprietary information, so the SCS page is been made
inaccessible to non-SLAC nodes.  Unfortunately, it also contains a lot of
extremely _useful_ general information.  Also, SLAC has a huge community
of offsite users, and I for one would rather run WWW locally than have to
log on to a SLAC machine every time.  Perhaps the SCS top level page could
contain links to "proprietary" and "non-proprietary" pages, and only the
former could be disabled?

2)  Giant PostScript.  The item "SLAC Networking Maps" is a graphical
PostScript file which I guess shows the structure of the SLAC Ethernet.
Unfortunately, xmosaic thinks the file is too big, and puts it through the
"Document Structure" processor, which displays the PostScript source as a
two-part TEXT file :-(

3)  Intermittent access.  This morning, when I tried to get to the SCS
home page at all, I got an error message that xmosaic was unable to access
the information server "heplibw3".  When I FINGER'ed this node from Jupiter,
I discovered that it was in fact SLACVM, and was perfectly accessible.

I know these are probably minor problems, but since I haven't been able
to get past them, I don't know if there are any major ones out there :-)

In case anyone is interested I've recorded requests from 2267 different
IP addresses on my WWW server.  I'm wondering what the numbers are for
sites like NCSA and CERN.  That's a lot of WWW users.

Anyone interested in doing a consolidated IP list?  If you have one
send me a pointer and I'll ftp it and summerize back in a few days.
(it should be a uniq'ed list of IP address, FQDN's will do if that's all

I am not particularly happy about my system logging, as I haven't properly
automated everything yet, but I do have a list of (resolved) ip addresses.
My count up to today is 2194.

FTP it? pht :-) My list is on http://web.nexor.co.uk/logs/users
I want to put more of the logs in the web, but I haven't decided exactly
what or how. That's why it has not been linked in nicely.

My list has both, which is probably usefull. I for one would be interested in
the .gov/.edu/.com/country distribution of all these users.

Hi,

below I include the ismap.c program I use from the EXPO terrain map.
You can use it as you like. If time comes to include it in the httpd itself,
I would prefer to do that myself (some good ideas!!) but if you
use it at a seperate port number, it is all yours.

no garantees!!

/*___________________________________________________________________
 | ismap.c 
 |
 | ismap decoding program written by 
 |
 |                        Frans van Hoesel (c) 1993
 |
 | ismap works by comparing the requested filename in the URL (without leading
 | path components) with the in files the directory ISMAP_PATH.
 | The mapfile found in that directory have a very simple syntax
 | it has lines in the form of
 | <some test function> <some file to send>
 | were <some test function> is one of:
 |      rect (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
 |		returns true if the mouse coordinates are within
 |		the rectangle (mind the order of the corners)
 |	circle (xcenter, ycenter, radius)
 |		returns true if the coordinates are inside the circle
 |	noismap
 |		returns true if the browser does not support the ismap
 |		feature.
 |	default
 |		always true and *MUST* be present, for ismap to work
 |		properly
 | and <some file to send> is the absolute path to the file which is
 | returned to the browser if the test returned true.
 | all test are performed in a top-down order, and only the first that
 | returns true is executed. Therefore the default must be the last
 | clause specified.
 | comments start at '#'
 | 
 | for efficienty reasons, it is best to put the test in such an order
 | that the one that is most likely to return true is near the top.
 | 
 | IMPORTANT: as this ismap decoder runs from another port number you will
 | need to convert any relative links you might have to full URLs, but only
 | for documents referenced via ismap.
 | 
 | compile this using an ansi compiler (gcc?)
 | 
 | you should set this up by editing your /etc/services file
 | It should contain a line like:
 |    ismap	8988/tcp	# mapping that works 
 | and in your /etc/inetd.conf:
 |    ismap stream tcp nowait http /usr/local/bin/ismap ismap
 | where http is the user-id which has access to the map files and the
 | documents returned by the ismap program; /usr/local/bin is the asumed
 | location of the binairy (you might consider /usr/local/etc/httpd/ismap)
 | you'll need a kill -HUP <process id of inetd>
 | and if you are running YP, you'll need to push the sevices over the network
 |
 | Some of the code in here is untested, so if you find any bugs
 | send them to hoesel@chem.rug.nl
 | In near future I'll add poly(x1,y1,x2,y2,....) that test for abritrary
 | polygons. (for now you can use multiple rect() to approximate the polygone)
 |
 | ++++++++++++++++++++++ READ THIS IF YOU ARE A DEVELOPPER +++++++++++++++++
 |
 | If only the browser all around the world would recognize the file type
 | by looking at the correct place for the extension then somefile.gif?234,345 
 | would known to return a gif image, then the ismap would be served from
 | the httpd directly (and we could add a feature for searchable index too). 
 | (this is ofcourse a hint to all the browser programmers out there )
 | Having one single and simple httpd that would serve all this is needed so
 | people will use ismap and searchable index much more. I'll be happy to
 | modify the httpd. // in fact I could already offer you a modified
 | httpd, but that would only work for html files //

 | example map file:
 | # this is an example mapfile
 | default		/usr/data/default.html
 | rect(10,20,100,200)	/usr/data/rect1.html
 | rect(20,30,100,400)  /usr/data/rect2.html
 | noismap		/usr/data/sorry.html
 
 | store this file in the path specified below
 | eg. /usr/local/etc/httpd/mapfiles/mymap.html 
 | (note that this extension is html (so browser might know that you are
 | returning html files (but that could well be gifs, au, etc)
 | And reference it in a document as:
 | <a href="http://site.dom:8988/some_path_which_is_not_used/mymap.html">
 |   <img src="http://site.dom/your_image.gif" ismap></a>

 | it is expected that you offer an alternative way to access rect1.html and
 | rect2.html from the document sorry.html, so people without ismap support
 | can still use it.

 | error message are send as html files. so if you have problems in using
 | this, change your returned type to html (instead of gif or au) so you can
 | read these messages. I guess most people will returns html files, so
 | you will not have to do anything special to get the error messages.

As part of deciding how to ``do'' annotations, I'd like to know what

I am not particularly happy about my system logging, as I haven't properly
automated everything yet, but I do have a list of (resolved) ip addresses.
My count up to today is 2194.

FTP it? pht :-) My list is on http://web.nexor.co.uk/logs/users
I want to put more of the logs in the web, but I haven't decided exactly
what or how. That's why it has not been linked in nicely.

My list has both, which is probably usefull. I for one would be interested in
the .gov/.edu/.com/country distribution of all these users.

Hi,

below I include the ismap.c program I use from the EXPO terrain map.
You can use it as you like. If time comes to include it in the httpd itself,
I would prefer to do that myself (some good ideas!!) but if you
use it at a seperate port number, it is all yours.

no garantees!!

/*___________________________________________________________________
 | ismap.c 
 |
 | ismap decoding program written by 
 |
 |                        Frans van Hoesel (c) 1993
 |
 | ismap works by comparing the requested filename in the URL (without leading
 | path components) with the in files the directory ISMAP_PATH.
 | The mapfile found in that directory have a very simple syntax
 | it has lines in the form of
 | <some test function> <some file to send>
 | were <some test function> is one of:
 |      rect (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
 |		returns true if the mouse coordinates are within
 |		the rectangle (mind the order of the corners)
 |	circle (xcenter, ycenter, radius)
 |		returns true if the coordinates are inside the circle
 |	noismap
 |		returns true if the browser does not support the ismap
 |		feature.
 |	default
 |		always true and *MUST* be present, for ismap to work
 |		properly
 | and <some file to send> is the absolute path to the file which is
 | returned to the browser if the test returned true.
 | all test are performed in a top-down order, and only the first that
 | returns true is executed. Therefore the default must be the last
 | clause specified.
 | comments start at '#'
 | 
 | for efficienty reasons, it is best to put the test in such an order
 | that the one that is most likely to return true is near the top.
 | 
 | IMPORTANT: as this ismap decoder runs from another port number you will
 | need to convert any relative links you might have to full URLs, but only
 | for documents referenced via ismap.
 | 
 | compile this using an ansi compiler (gcc?)
 | 
 | you should set this up by editing your /etc/services file
 | It should contain a line like:
 |    ismap	8988/tcp	# mapping that works 
 | and in your /etc/inetd.conf:
 |    ismap stream tcp nowait http /usr/local/bin/ismap ismap
 | where http is the user-id which has access to the map files and the
 | documents returned by the ismap program; /usr/local/bin is the asumed
 | location of the binairy (you might consider /usr/local/etc/httpd/ismap)
 | you'll need a kill -HUP <process id of inetd>
 | and if you are running YP, you'll need to push the sevices over the network
 |
 | Some of the code in here is untested, so if you find any bugs
 | send them to hoesel@chem.rug.nl
 | In near future I'll add poly(x1,y1,x2,y2,....) that test for abritrary
 | polygons. (for now you can use multiple rect() to approximate the polygone)
 |
 | ++++++++++++++++++++++ READ THIS IF YOU ARE A DEVELOPPER +++++++++++++++++
 |
 | If only the browser all around the world would recognize the file type
 | by looking at the correct place for the extension then somefile.gif?234,345 
 | would known to return a gif image, then the ismap would be served from
 | the httpd directly (and we could add a feature for searchable index too). 
 | (this is ofcourse a hint to all the browser programmers out there )
 | Having one single and simple httpd that would serve all this is needed so
 | people will use ismap and searchable index much more. I'll be happy to
 | modify the httpd. // in fact I could already offer you a modified
 | httpd, but that would only work for html files //

 | example map file:
 | # this is an example mapfile
 | default		/usr/data/default.html
 | rect(10,20,100,200)	/usr/data/rect1.html
 | rect(20,30,100,400)  /usr/data/rect2.html
 | noismap		/usr/data/sorry.html
 
 | store this file in the path specified below
 | eg. /usr/local/etc/httpd/mapfiles/mymap.html 
 | (note that this extension is html (so browser might know that you are
 | returning html files (but that could well be gifs, au, etc)
 | And reference it in a document as:
 | <a href="http://site.dom:8988/some_path_which_is_not_used/mymap.html">
 |   <img src="http://site.dom/your_image.gif" ismap></a>

 | it is expected that you offer an alternative way to access rect1.html and
 | rect2.html from the document sorry.html, so people without ismap support
 | can still use it.

 | error message are send as html files. so if you have problems in using
 | this, change your returned type to html (instead of gif or au) so you can
 | read these messages. I guess most people will returns html files, so
 | you will not have to do anything special to get the error messages.

What do you think of this this format for summaries.  It's
interesting that from only two host logs we have 3375 hosts.

I should probably special case names that end with country and
codes and go a level deeper for them (so you could see the
break-down). e.g., a couple of top 5's:

     19 leeds.ac.uk.                       49 cs.ubc.ca.
     18 rl.ac.uk.                          3 ucs.ubc.ca.
     13 ed.ac.uk.                          2 ppc.ubc.ca.
     12 cam.ac.uk.                         2 ee.ubc.ca.
     11 ox.ac.uk.                          2 astro.ubc.ca.

Would you rather see just the break-down or do you like the Top Level
Domain Summary as well?  In the break-down would you like to see this:
     205 ac.uk.
         19 leeds.ac.uk.
         18 rl.ac.uk.
         13 ed.ac.uk.
         12 cam.ac.uk.
         11 ox.ac.uk.
Or just the top users in that domain mixed in with the others?  maybe I
should move ac.uk. up into the "toplevel" section?

I've uploaded a prerelease version of tkWWW-0.9 to info.cern.ch.  It's
now in /pub/incoming/joe, but I'd like for it to be moved to
/pub/www/dev.

This version has a few enhancements in that it now uses WWW library
2.09a and is compatible with TCL 7.0.  I've done a general rewrite of
a lot of the code, which means that it is highly buggy right now and a
lot of things don't work.  It's mainly for people interested in tkWWW
development to let people know what is going on.  Use it at your own
risk.

Subject: impact of move to http/1.0
X-Md4-Signature: bceb9e0300973e08fe95f6fa5acddae1
Status: RO

I'm becoming concerned about the impending move to HTTP/1.0 compliance
on behalf of all known clients.  Why?  The following code:

    fields = sscanf(line_buffer, "%20s%d",
                    server_version,
                    &server_status);
    
    if (fields < 2) 
      {			/* HTTP0 reply */
        ...
      } 
    else 
      {                 /* HTTP/1.0 reply */
        ...
      }

This is how the client library, and therefore the clients, figure out
whether they're talking to a HTTP0 or HTTP/1.0 server on the fly.
(The precept is that if the first "line" -- in quotes because, despite
various sources of resistance, binary data often flies across HTTP0
now -- of the received data stream is something like "HTTP/1.0 200
Document follows", then the client knows it's talking to a HTTP/1.0
server.  If not, then it's a HTTP0 server.)

So any file such a client accesses that resides on a HTTP0 server and
begins with a sequence of bytes that matches such a pattern is going
to fool the client into thinking it is talking to a HTTP/1.0 server,
and the data will therefore be interpreted incorrectly.

This problem will up and go away if (a) everyone switches to HTTP/1.0
across the board practically immediately or (b) nobody ever serves
such a file from a HTTP0 server.  I'm not sure how likely either of
these scenarios is, but I've got a bad feeling about it.

So.... does anyone have any other ideas on how to handle this
situation?

Cheers,
Marc

I think that whatever format you choose, people will want different info.
So I think it is important that the merged file you base the summaries
on is also available on the web.

Good idea... uk.co too?

How about all three? :-) 

What do we want to get out of these stats and summaries? Globally 
I'd like to know how many users there are, where they are (country), 
and who they are (commercial, educational, governmental). 
The total number is easy, the breakdown per country is easy, 
and the breakdown per category we can only do in the US and the UK? 

To see how well used the web is I'd like to know how many documents are
accessible (which is impossible...any wild guesses?), and how many requests
are made. That we can do, if we keep say a league table of number of requests
per server per week. Is anybody keeping that sort of statistic?

I tried to kinda make the guide relatively well styled itself though
that is asking for flames. I have included Larry's rant in the guide
 as I agree with it completely.

Hi web-masters,
we are trying to get a browser and server for an MVS environment. We
already installed and started a little server (NCSA's httpd) on unix, but
most of our data lives on an IBM mainframe running MVS, so we would like
to get server code for that. Has somebody already done it ?.
Regarding browsers we have Mosaic and lynx on unix and the CERN browser
on VM. Any browsers for MVS around ?
Thanks in advance,
Gabriela

Ugh!

Split the line on spaces and check the third field (if one exists)
and optionally make sure it says `HTTP/1.0'.

For example, here is my code from Plexus:
    local($method, $uri, $version, $waste) = split(" ", $_, 4);
    &parse_headers(*in_headers) if $version;

The Berkeley Plateau Research Group is happy to announce the
release of Version 1.0 of its MPEG video encoder.
The encoder is available via anonymous ftp from toe.cs.berkeley.edu
(128.32.149.117) in /pub/multimedia/mpeg/mpeg_encode-1.0.tar.Z.
That directory includes a sample uncompressed video sequence
(flower.tar), our software MPEG video player, and some MPEG movies.

Below is a copy of the README file:
------------------------------------------

                 MPEG-1 Video Software Encoder
                 (Version 1.0; July 30, 1993)

     Lawrence A. Rowe, Kevin Gong, Ketan Patel, and Dan Wallach
    Computer Science Division-EECS, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley

This directory contains the freely distributed Berkeley MPEG-1 Video
Encoder.  The decoder implements the standard described in the ISO/IEC
International Standard 11172-2.  The code has been compiled and tested
on the following platforms:

 HP PA-RISC (HP/UX 8.X, X11R4) (i.e., HP 9000/7XX and 9000/3XX)
 Sun Sparc (SunOS 4.X, X11R5)
 DECstation 5000 and Alpha

If you decide to port the code to a new architecture, please let
us know so that we can incorporate the changes into our sources.

This directory contains everything required to build the encoder
and run it.  We have included source code, makefiles, binaries
for selected platforms, documentation, and test data.  Installation
instructions are given in the file named src/INSTALL.  A man
page is given in the file doc/mpeg_encode.1.

The encoder will accept any input file format as long as you provide
a script to convert the images to PPM or YUV format.  Input file
processing is described in the file doc/INPUT.FORMAT.  Options to control
input file processing and compression parameters are specified in
a parameter file.  Very little error processing is done when reading
this file.  We suggest you start with the sample parameter file
examples/template.param and modify it.  See also examples/default.param.

We have also provided a Tcl/Tk script, named encode.tcl, that can
be used to set parameters interactively (see the misc/ directory).
The misc/ directory contains utility you might find useful including:
programs to do PPM/YUV conversion and programs to convert Parallax
XVideo JPEG files into PPM or YUV frames.

The motion vector search window can be specified, including half-pixel
block matching, in the parameter file.  We have implemented several
search algorithms for P-frames including: 1) exhaustive search,
2) subsampled search, and 3) logarithmic search.  We have also implemented
several alternatives for B-frame block matching including: 1) interpolate
best forward and best backward block, 2) find backward block for best
forward or vice-versa (called CROSS2), and 3) exhaustive cross product
(i.e., go out for coffee and a donut!). The search algorithms are controlled
by options in the parameters file.  For tips on choosing the right search
technique, see doc/TIPS.

We have done some tuning to produce a reasonable encoder, but there are
many more optimizations that we would like to incorporate.  These
extensions are listed in the file EXTENSIONS.  If you succeed in
implementing any of them, please let us know! We have established
several mailing lists for messages about the Berkeley MPEG work:

mpeg-list-dist@CS.Berkeley.EDU
   General information on the MPEG-1 decoder and encoder for
   everyone interested should be sent to this list.

mpeg-list-request@CS.Berkeley.EDU
   Requests to join or leave the list should be sent to this
   address. The subject line should contain the single word
   ADD or DELETE.

mpeg-bugs@CS.Berkeley.EDU
   Problems, questions, or patches should be sent to this address.

Our future plans include porting the encoder to run on other
platforms and completing a portable parallel version of the code
that will run on a network of workstations.  Vendors or other
organizations interested in supporting this research or discussing
other aspects of this project should contact Larry Rowe at
Rowe@CS.Berkeley.EDU (+1 510-642-5117).

Ok, How about the format below.  It goes two levels down for all
domains that end with a two letter code, and one level down for the rest.
For the online version it will sort each top level domain into seperate
files and generate an index summary with pointers to the detailed lists.

Should I limit the three level reports to domains with .ac .edu or .com
subdomains (i.e., .at .au .be .il .jp .kr .nz .pl .sg .tr .tw .uk .us .za)?
so .ch would look like this sample.  On the other hand I could have it
so that it only details known subdomain names (.edu .ac .co .gv .gov .com
any others?).  Speak now.

The detailed reports are sorted alphabetically but the index will be
sorted by count.  Does that sounds ok?

The next challenge is to gather this information automatically.
Then we can start adding new features.

I fail to see the usefulness of this data.  The number of different
ip addresses accessing servers is very misleading.  For
a good example of why, consider that 1000 users a day use our anonymous
access acount, yet they only ever have one ip address.  The only thing
that these numbers tell you is how many different computers are being
used.  Why don't you collect the number of hits from each ip address
and merge them to find out the number of total hits per domain.

Yea,

fields = sscanf(line_buffer, "%20s %d", server_version, &server_status);

if(fields == 2 && strcasecmp(server_version, "HTTP/1.0") == 0)
    {
    /* HTTP/1.0 reply */
    }
else
    {
    /* HTTP0 reply */
    }

Lynx Ver. 2.0.11 is now available for anonymous ftp from
 FTP2.cc.ukans.edu    as   /pub/lynx/lynx2-0-11.tar.Z

( ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx/lynx2-0-11.tar.Z )

Lynx is a distributed hypertext browser with full World Wide Web
and Gopher capibilities.  For an explanation of features and a demo, 
telnet to "kufacts.cc.ukans.edu" and login as "www".

This release of Lynx has been compiled by me on the following platforms:

 o  IBM (AIX 3.2)
 o  DEC Ultrix
 o  DEC Alpha OSF/1
 o  Sun 4
 o  NeXT (Mine is an older version of NeXTStep, but it should work 
         with newer ones too.)

Binaries for the following platforms are available:

 o  IBM (AIX 3.2, will work with 3.1 as well)
 o  Ultrix
 o  Alpha OSF/1
 o  Sun 4
 
 * see VMS note below

A listserv list has been created for the distribution of
Lynx related information and updates.
  o  Lynx-Dev@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu
 
Send a subscribe request to listserv@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu to
be added to the list.  All new releases will be anounced on this
list.  Please do not send subscribe requests to the the Lynx-Dev
list directly.

*VMS NOTE*
Lynx 2.0.11 has not yet been ported to VMS!  After this release I will
begin work on the VMS version.  Since the WWW Library has not
been ported to VMS since about 9 versions ago it is becoming increasingly
difficult to support VMS features.  Expect the VMS version of Lynx 2.0.11
soon after the WWW Library is ported.  (Port requests can be sent to
www-bug@info.cern.ch :)  For the time being, VMS users will have to 
continue useing Lynx version 2.0.10.

The following new features have been added:

o updated help and converted it to HTML.  Made a new help location and
  server.  The new default help file is 
  http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html
o Added the ability to edit local HTML files. 
  I recommend using Marc Andressen's html_mode.el emacs macro
  package with this.
o Lynx now reloads local HTML files and re-renders them after editing.
o Added document reload command.  CTRL-R when pressed will reload
  the document into memory and redisplay it, clearing the screen.
  This is very useful when editing documents, outside of Lynx while 
  using Lynx for rendering.
o Added source view mode.  '\' when pressed will reload the document
  and display the HTML source.  When '\' is pressed again the rendered
  document will be redisplayed
o Added the ALT atribute to the IMG tag.  If ALT is present within
  the IMG tag then the value is printed instead of [IMAGE].  The value
  can be set to empty by using ALT like this: <IMG ALT="">
  Please use the alt attribute in every <img> tag you create!
o Added binary file transfer ability.  When binary files are selected
  the user is prompted for a file name to save to.  The default directory
  is the one the user started in.  This should work for most ftp sites
  and their contents.
o Added Nested Lists, up to six levels, with different bullets
  for each level.
o added BR (linebreak) tag!
  The <br> tag inserts a line break and maintains the current style!
  The <br> tag may be used anywhere.
o Due to the fact that nearly everyone seems to use <p> to mean
  two returns within the same style. I have changed
  the <p> tag to reflect this interpretation.  <p> can be used
  anywhere and will mean insert two returns.  (i.e. two <br> tags)
o added HR (horizontal rule tag!)
  The <hr> tag puts a horizontal line seperating two bodies of text.
  The <hr> tag may be used anywhere.
o Made the default Mime type for unknown file types on ftp servers
  to be text/plain.  Previously the WWWLibrary had the default
  as application/octet-stream which meant that most files could not
  be viewed.
o Changed the ADDRESS style to be more like XMosaic
  Left flush, newline top and bottom
o The Statusline now displays the URL when retrieving files.
o All spaces, tabs and returns are now collapsed down do one
  space.
o added '*' (stars) to unordered lists and numbers to ordered
  lists.
o changed dir lists to be more like menu lists.
o all emphasis, physical and symantic, now have _underlines_
  around them to show emphasis.

A partial list of bugs that have been fixed

o fixed incompatibilites with the NCSA HTTP/.9 server.
o files coming from HTTP/.9 servers are recognized by their
  file extensions
o fixed bug whiched caused certain links beginning at the
  begining of a line to be bad.
o fixed bug in LibWWW that caused it not to be able to convert to
  www/source.
o fixed bug in LibWWW that caused most binary file transfers to fail
o fixed bug in LibWWW which caused a segmentation fault when some
  anchors were left unterminated.
o a few other small bugs.

The immediate goal is to approximate the total number of WWW "users"
(and while we are at it find out where they are) so we can measure
the growth of the Web.  Since we can't measure actual users it seems
that the number of IP addresses is a "good enough" metric for tracking
growth (it's much better than NSF net packet counts anyway).

In the future I would like to add in more stats and automate the whole
process.  I posted a proposal about this a while back and only got a couple
of interested people so I figured I would start small.  When I get some
free time I'll work on the full proposal some more, suggestions are
welcome.

Thanks to reinpost@info.win.tue.nl (Reinier Post) for pointing
out these problems.

The syntax of Gopher URLs given in

  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/GopherAddressing.html

has been amended to conform to the official URL spec:

is now:
>     gopher:// hostname [: port ] [/gtype [selector] ] [ ?search ]
was:
>     gopher:// hostname [: port ] [/gtype/ [selector] ] [ ?search ]

Apologies for the bug in the online version.

> (or ' reinpost', etc.)

That is a bug in Cello.  The URL has a gtype field (it has to, as  
that is part of the Gopher link info) and then the selector. It
happens that often the gopher type is repeated as eth first char of
the selector string but you can't rely on it. 



A correct URL is

	gopher://gopher.win.tue.nl:79/0reinpost

Mosaic 2.x does it right.

There used to be an MVS version of the line-mode Browser and WWW lib
but had not kept up with updates and changes... I took that code and
made it work under MVS/TSO. It is available as part of my CSOCK
package at ftp.mic.ucla.edu:/pub/mvs/www. It is version 1.x though,
I have presently the line-mode browser v2.06 and the WWW lib v2.09a
but I haven't posted the code yet... the line-mode browser is useful
enough but a more sophisticated browser is needed, something like an
ISPF-based browser, I may be doing that sometime soon...

Also, Tim Gausslin of the US Geological Service has now ported the
FreeWAIS code to MVS, so in principle the WWW library could be made
to use WAIS natively (though the WWW module that interfaces to WWW
needs some updating to make it portable to MVS, ie., uses socket
descriptors as file handles which is not supported by our IBM C
compiler and TCPIP services).

I haven't ported the WWW server code to MVS, the most difficult part
about that would be dealing with "forking"... you have to use MVS
tasking and some of the special calls in TCPIP sockets to pass
connections to subtasks.

I would like to set up X mosaic so that the default print format is
PostScript and the default for mailing is plain text.  I don't want
our users to have to remember that they must choose PostScript to get
the best result on our printers. We found the menu and reconfigured it
to make PostScript be the one that appeared to be selected but
obviously we are missing something because somewhere inside it still
thinks that plain text is selected :-( Is there an easy way to 
reconfigure this? Is it reconfigurable in 2.0? (which I am not using).

Please reply to me and to zbyslaw@europarc.xerox.com directly as we
are not receiving www-talk.

Hello,

I have just started working with CNIDR to port the WWW server code to
Win. NT.  As I come from the MSDOS/Win. world, I am a real beginner

X-Md4-Signature: 69a842725c4b32afad31e33ea7a92a2c
Status: RO

A number of servers on the net are running HTTP/1.0 server software
that is not sufficiently configured to recognize the various
multimedia files that are being served.  A common example is that the
server software is not realizing that ".au" means audio/basic, ".tex"
means application/x-tex, and so on.  Instead, such multimedia elements
are being handed to HTTP/1.0 clients as type "application/binary".

The only thing a HTTP/1.0 client can do with "application/binary"
(which, for the record, isn't even a proper MIME type) is offer to
save it to a file.  HTTP/1.0 clients will not look at file extensions
when communicating with HTTP/1.0 servers -- the MIME type returned by
the server will be considered the definitive type.

Sooooooooo, if you want your server to continue to serve multimedia
data elements to Mosaic for X 2.0 and all the other neat HTTP/1.0
clients that will be coming out Real Soon Now and you are running a
server that talks HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.0 clients, you should look into
this very soon...

As a result of discussions at the INET93 Developing Countries Workshop two weeks
ago, I am now running a mail server which accesses the web. Many people have onl
   y
email right now, especially developing countries, so this is a mechanism to let
them read the documents.

point documentation.

Basically, send a 1-line mail to webmail@curia.ucc.ie containing

     GO <url>

where <url> is the URL you want to retrieve. This is alpha, so please test it. C

Anyone want to write code that uses a `file' like database to work out
the type of the file, so the server can correctly identify file types
without needing to look at their extension?

Grab file://ftp.cs.ubc.ca/ftp/local/src/hfile
If you can grok perl, it will tell you how to identify lots of different
file types.  I'd really like to put this functionality into the
browsers.  Even though HTTP/1.0 will partially solve the problem, there's
still FTP sites and local files which have no other type information.

Another warning to HTTP/1.0 information providers.  There is a bug in
the libwww 2.0 libraries such that you better make sure you do a
fflush() after outputting your HTTP/1.0 reply header.  It only bites
if you're sending back a binary file (say, a GIF image) that has a
0 byte near the start.  I sent off a bug report about this, but
haven't heard if the bug has been fixed.

Subject: converting URLs in .html files
Status: RO

Has anyone dealt with automatically converting the URLs within HTML files
so that you could take a set of files like the Library of Congress Vatican
Exhibit and use them off a local HTTP server rather than across the
Internet? This would be especially useful for doing WWW demos which are
time constrained and thus best run on a local Ethernet. This would also be
the simplest way to change the locations of sets of HTML, GIF images,
PostScript, etc. when the "exhibit" is moved to another server or directory
location, even if it is in the same domain as the original. URLs could also
be changed to use "file" instead of "http" in most cases so that a file set
could be tested on a local disk (say a PC or Mac) without the need for a
server or TCP/IP connection. For HTML created for CD-ROM or some other
static medium, conversion from "file" to "http" or whatever would be
necessary if the files are made net accessible.

I suspect it would still be necessary to recreate the folder hierarchy of
the source server to some extent, but that would be part of the conversion
process. Maybe a utility (perl script anyone?) could be written to match a
set of files, change URLs appropriately, then tar all the files. Or given a
tar archive, change all the URLs after the files were extracted.

Subject: libwww2 bug
Status: RO

Here's a little more info on the libwww2 bug I talked about in my previous
message.  When it gets a reply from an HTTP server, the library has to
read some bytes and parse the HTTP reply header, if any.  Of course, it
may read beyond the header in which case it must pass that extra
data to the specific content-type handler.  Unfortunately, it uses something
equivalent to strcmp() to do this.  If the extra data happened to have
a '\0' in it, a little piece near the start of the data would get
dropped.  Believe me, this plays havoc with GIF + JPEG images :-).

I've got a completely untested patch for the problem.  I gather that
Marc A. probably has a patch too.  Either way, lots of clients already
have the bug and good servers can keep them working by putting a
TCP/IP packet boundary in after the header.  Under UNIX, this means
that the header must end on a write() boundary.  If you're using stdio,
you'll want to do something like this to output a header:

    printf("HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows\r\n");
    printf("MIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: image/gif\r\n");
    printf("\r\n");
    fflush(stdout);

or, if you're a perl hacker:

    print "HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows\r\n";
    print "MIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: image/gif\r\n";
    $| = 1;
    print "\r\n";
    $| = 0;

Here's my untested patch.  It may not work, but I think it will give
you a good idea how to really fix the problem.

Subject: future of mosaic annotations
X-Md4-Signature: 9a091f95f1a6a44014b209b48f4cce3e
Status: RO

We're thinking of ripping the *existing* group annotation support out
of the Mosaic 2.0 client and upcoming revisions of the NCSA httpd, and
shutting down the existing annotation server on hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu.
The reasons are:

(a) The existing protocol was strictly experimental, and at the recent
    developer's conference, a better, HTTP/1.0-based annotation
    protocol was devised.
(b) The existing group annotation server software is sadly deficient
    in many ways, including notification and annotation database
    management; a rewrite will be required to fix these problems (they
    have proven nearly crippling for real use of group annotations).
(c) The annotation server on hoohoo (which warped the original idea of
    "group" annotations by being public to all Mosaic users) has
    outlived its usefulness as a global mechanism and should be put to
    sleep.

The first instantiation of the new annotation protocol will likely be
in the form of "public" -- that is, annotations that reside on the
same server as the documents they annotate -- annotation support, as
opposed to group annotation support.  (This is one result of the
hoohoo experiment...)  A future version of Plexus will likely support
this (not to overcommit Tony :-).  Public annotations should be *much*
more useful to a larger number of people than the existing scheme --
the solution is scalable and everything should be faster.

The same (new) protocol should also be relevant for the group
annotation principle, and a future version of the NCSA httpd will
probably include group annotation support based on this protocol (with
the underlying current problems of notification and annotation
database management addressed).

How's that sound?

the simplest way to change the locations of sets of HTML, GIF images,
PostScript, etc. when the "exhibit" is moved to another server or directory
location, even if it is in the same domain as the original. URLs could also
be changed to use "file" instead of "http" in most cases so that a file set
could be tested on a local disk (say a PC or Mac) without the need for a
server or TCP/IP connection. For HTML created for CD-ROM or some other
static medium, conversion from "file" to "http" or whatever would be
necessary if the files are made net accessible.

I suspect it would still be necessary to recreate the folder hierarchy of
the source server to someextent, but that would be part of the conversion
process. Maybe a utility (perl script anyone?) could be written to match a
set of files, change URLs appropriately, then tar all the files. Or given a
tar archive, change all the URLs after the files were extracted.

I've been thinking about what it would take to create a 'mirror' program
for HTTP, similar to the program of the same name for anonymous ftp sites.

I want to give the program a single URL, and a local directory and have it
retrieve the document for that URL, then extract a list of other URLs, and
determine which are "internal" links to more pieces of the same 'exhibit',
and which are "external" links.  It would keep all the "external" links,
and change all "internal" links to refer to the local http server, and 
retrieve their documents.

The only thing I can think of that would work well for determining whether
or not a link is "internal" or "external" would be to violate the URL,
looking inside the opaque descriptor and determine if the two documents
were in the same directory.  But then, we see many closely related 
'exhibits' that are spread among several directories.  If those directories
are all subdirectories of a single directory, though, the parent directory
could be used in a comparison to determine whether the URL was "internal"
or "external".

With such a program (and it doesn't really look too difficult for a perl
script), we could have major 'cache' sites in different areas of the world
that maintain large 'archives' of great HTML material.

Of course, the URN concept makes this all work even better.

This won't help with the Vatican exhibit, but: If a cluster of related
files is written using relative URLs, then the only `conversion' you
need to do is to change the entry point.

That is, if http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/vatican.exhibit/vatican.exhibit.html
contained a link to HREF="exhibit/Main_Hall.html", then you could just
copy all the files over to your local net, and jump to (say)
file:///my/html/files/vatican.exhibit/vatican.exhibit.html,
and the reference would now point you to the Main Hall file on your
local filesystem.

The Vatican exhibit uses absolute URLs, which is a pain for moving or
copying files.  Oh well.  A cluster of related files using relative
URLs should be easily portable.  (That's the point of relative URLs,
as I understand it.)  Yes, you need

					 to recreate the folder hierarchy of
   the source server 

but this is something that tar and other archivers already do.

For links that _aren't_ relative, it's really questionable whether you
want to convert.  Usually (I hope) an URL inside a document is
absolute because it points to something unrelated, which wouldn't be
part of the package you brought to your local net anyway.  Of course,
this isn't the case with the Vatican exhibit, or, no doubt, with many
other data sets on the web now.  I can dream, though.

   The only thing I can think of that would work well for determining whether
   or not a link is "internal" or "external" would be to violate the URL,
   looking inside the opaque descriptor and determine if the two documents
   were in the same directory.  

This is how I was originally going to respond:

HTTP paths are not opaque; nor are FTP paths or Gopher paths
(according to the URL spec, although according to the Gopher spec they
should be).

            The path is interpreted in a manner dependent on the
          protocol being used. However, when it contains slashes, these
          must imply a hierarchical structure.

(from page 9 of ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc/url6.txt)

And on the next page, a set of rules is given for how

          certain characters ("/") and certain path elements ("..", ".")
          have a significance reserved for representing a hierarchical
          space

So, effectively, the path _can_ be used to determine whether or not
two files are in the same `directory'.  (Of course, this isn't true in
the JHM web gateway, and it probably isn't true in many other places
where slashes are abused.  The point is, paths aren't supposed to be
opaque, and if we indicate a hierarchical structure where there is
none, we deserve to lose.)

So that was how I was going to respond.  But then, on a whim, I did a
search through the same document for the string "opaque", and found
that one of the necessary parts of the structure of a name (huh?  I
thought this was a `locator'.) was

                  . Information to be passed to the server. This may be
                    private to the server, as all names may be generated
                    and used by the same server. This part of the name
                    should be opaque to the client.

This seems pretty clearly to refer to the `path' element.  So why are
clients mucking around with the contents of a path given in partial
form?

Maybe I'm unclear on what's meant here by "opaque".

Okay, I already knew about doing relative URLs but in looking at the source
of various HTML documents out in the Web, it seems like absolute paths are
being used a lot. I think two things need to happen. One, existing "sets"
of file should be converted to use relative pathing where possible.  Two,
Getting Started, HTML Primers, etc. should emphasize the use of relative
paths over absolute paths; how many people are doing absolute pathing when
it isn't even necessary just because they didn't know better? The same
problem applies to using "http" references when a "file" reference is
adequate?! Maybe a sample HTML set could be put together which utilizes
relative paths throughout the HTML documents, incorporates references to
MPEG, PostScript, GIF, and other non-HTML documents?

Anybody have some self-contained "multi-media" sets of HTML out there that
could be installed at a different site as long as the directory structure
is recreated? Things like the Krannert Art Museum HTML makes lots of
absolute references to the icons, etc. If nothing else, you should be able
to localize those. Maybe www directory trees should contain a "lib"
directory so everyone can store "lib/icons/PointRight.xbm",
"lib/icons/RightArrow.gif", etc. so that relative references to common
elements would work correctly?

The URN stuff may make this unneccesary in a few years but relative pathing
is the best solution today to get around the lack of distributed databases
for the Web.

Hello all,

   This is just a simple request for everyone developing/running
HTTP/0.9 servers that are semi-broken.

   There are several HTTP servers out there that don't understand
HTTP/1.0 requests, and don't strip off the HTRQ from the GET command.
(Most notably the SLAC searchable index, and the info gateway at
ohio-state)

   With the movement of all known browsers to HTTP/1.0, this will get
to be a problem pretty quick.  The line mode browser, lynx, and my emacs
browser all support HTTP/1.0, and soon mosaic will.  It will be
annoying and confusing to the users when all of a sudden they can't
access these servers (lynx returns a blank page when trying to access
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:85/info/dir, same with any http/1.0
browser - it thinks you are trying to access HTRQ.info).

   All that is needed is for the servers to look for the first white
space in a request, not the end of the line.

   This will make the transition to HTTP/1.0 much easier - right now I
store a list of 'bad' servers that don't understand HTTP/1.0, but I
don't think that is the right way to go.

   Thanks,
      Bill P.

I've just fixed most of our servers (all but waisgate).  I don't have
time to really test this properly, hopefully I haven't broken
everything.

Subject: Re: converting URLs in .html files
Status: RO

Okay, I already knew about doing relative URLs but in looking at the source
of various HTML documents out in the Web, it seems like absolute paths are
being used a lot. I think two things need to happen. One, existing "sets"
of file should be converted to use relative pathing where possible.  Two,
Getting Started, HTML Primers, etc. should emphasize the use of relative
paths over absolute paths; how many people are doing absolute pathing when
it isn't even necessary just because they didn't know better? The same
problem applies to using "http" references when a "file" reference is
adequate?! Maybe a sample HTML set could be put together which utilizes
relative paths throughout the HTML documents, incorporates references to
MPEG, PostScript, GIF, and other non-HTML documents?

Anybody have some self-contained "multi-media" sets of HTML out there that
could be installed at a different site as long as the directory structure
is recreated? Things like the Krannert Art Museum HTML makes lots of
absolute references to the icons, etc. If nothing else, you should be able
to localize those. Maybe www directory trees should contain a "lib"
directory so everyone can store "lib/icons/PointRight.xbm",
"lib/icons/RightArrow.gif", etc. so that relative references to common
elements would work correctly?

The URN stuff may make this unneccesary in a few years but relative pathing
is the best solution today to get around the lack of distributed databases
for the Web.

Subject: Announcement: LaTeX2HTML v0.31 available
Status: RO

A new release of the LaTeX2HTML rtranslator (v0.31) is now available.

Here is a summary of the most important changes:

o Image Recycling 
   Images for equations, tables, figures, special characters etc.,
   generated by the translator are reused during subsequent runs.
   This offers tremendous improvements in speed after an initial 
   successful translation.  

o Cross-References Between (Local or Remote) Documents 
   Cross-references between documents (possibly on
   remote locations) can be established via symbolic labels which are
   independent of the physical filenames.  
   Such cross-references will be maintained with a 
   re-translation even after one or more of the documents have been
   broken into different physical parts or moved.  

o New Options 
   -external_images
      Images are accessed via hypertext links instead of being "inlined".
   -ascii_mode 
      The navigation icons switch to ascii equivalents and images 
      are not "inlined". This option makes documents more portable.

o New Texexpand (contributed by Robert S. Thau <rst@ai.mit.edu>)

o Minor Changes and Bug Fixes 

For more information on how to retrieve, install and use the translator see:
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html

An *ascii version* of the same documentation is at:

A postscript version of the above is available at:

and the changes from v0.3 at:

Subject: Problems with httpd_2.07
Status: RO


I have installed the httpd_2.07 on a SUN4, but I have had a lot of problems
in accessing my first document.
It turned out that all problems arrised from the rule file, even when I
decided to test it with the -R option. Maybe most of you know that, but 
I did not: You have to specify a rule file for the http at least for mapping 
http to the file gateway, e.g.

map /* file:/*
pass file:/* file:/Public/*
fail *

O.K. http is running now under the same conditions as before, but how can I
access the wais gateway now, since http is mapped to file?
I cannot manage to access the port of my wais server. Can somebody help me?

Subject: front-end for interactively controlling xmosaic from command line
Status: RO


In my spare time, i wrote this small script which acts as a
front-end for controlling NCSA's xmosaic WWW browser interactively
from command line. I personally found it very useful. You may ftp this 
program called "ss" or slideshow from:

	eitech.eitech.com (192.100.58.2)
under
	~ftp/pub/share/ss.tar.Z

Please do not throw brickbats at me if you don't like any or every part of
it, just drop in your comments very politely to me:

	E-Mail:	vinay@collage.eitech.com

------------------Here is the README------------------------------

"ss" or slideshow program is a front end for interactively controlling NCSA's
xmosaic WWW viewer from command line.

Usage:
	ss [filename]

where <filename> is any ascii text file containing URL's, with one
URL per line. check the file "url-show" included with this distribution.

If no <filename> is provided, then URL's need to be provided interactively
on command line for xmosaic to display the URL.

Subject: libwww/HTFTP.c and NetWare v3.11
Status: RO

I ran across a PC based ftp server that announced itself as "NetWare v3.11".

HTFTP.c (as used in xmosaic-2.0pre2) gets hung up with this server.  The
problem seems to be that the server does not ever respond to an "NLST"
message.

Is there a standard that says that ftp servers must respond to NLST?
Is there a patch for NetWare v3.11 available?  Or a newer release?

There is now a plexus developers mailing list
    plexus-dev@austin.bsdi.com

add/change/delete messages to plexus-dev-request@austin.bsdi.com.

The purpose of the list is to keep up with new development work and
exchange ideas about server development.

There is also a *beta* release of Plexus-3.0 on
    ftp://www.bsdi.com/pub/Plexus-3.0f.tar.Z
This release is to test the waters, then I will release 3.0 for real and
from then on (until 4.0) I will issue patches like other software packages.

New features are:
* Better error reporting
* Multi-port daemon (can handle requests on multiple ports)
* Loadable access filters (&net_filter)
* Easy to configure local.conf file
* flock/fcntl locking switch in local.conf
* Better docs (see http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/gateways.html)
* Single process
* Standalone or filter setext.pl
* Debug mode (-D outfile),
* New command line args:
  plexus [-c config] [-d topdir] [-i | -I sockfd] [-l log] [-p port] [-D diag]
* moved getuid/getgid before chroot() so you don't *have* to have local files
* plexus will now run from inetd or from the command line with -i option
* You can externally control the startup environment with -I option

The major change that gateway writers need to be aware of is that
$path is no longer "safe".  You can use &safeopen() (documented
in http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/support.html#safeopen) to open
files based on that data.  There are also some new features for
dealing with $query (see http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/gateways.html
and http://www.bsdi.com/server/search.pl).  Basically, the goal is
to make incoming requests 8-bit clean.  Paranoid programmers would
do this anyway.

Status: RO

As some of you have discovered, the contributed PostScript output code
used in Mosaic 2.0 prerelease 2 seems to not correctly handle certain
characters (128+, and a few characters below 128).  I'm not familiar
enough with PostScript to easily fix it and have a huge list of other
things left to do for 2.0, so....

Would anyone like to dive into that code (libhtmlw/HTML-PSformat.c)
and bulletproof it for full 8-bit character output?

Thousands of users, and your humble Mosaic developers, would be
eternally grateful...

Cheers,
Marc

Subject: Submitting input-form data to server
Cc: hackers@ora.com
Status: RO

Hi--

Following up on the input forms discussion at W5, we need to define a 
standard way for browsers to transmit input forms data to a server. 

* What syntax do we choose for marking up a property list? SGML or MIME?

* What information do we return in the property list? Complete text 
  (form document + input values), or only the essential user-input values?



Consider this form, for example:

	<FORM HREF="http://pizza.com/service/order">
	<P>Your address:
	<INPUT name="address">
	<P>Sizes: 
	<UL>
	<LI><INPUT name="size" type="radio" value="large">Large
	<LI><INPUT name="size" type="radio" value="medium">Medium
	<LI><INPUT name="size" type="radio" value="small" checked>Small
	</UL>
	<P>Toppings:
	<UL>
	<LI><INPUT name="toppings" type="check" value="artichoke">Artichoke
	<LI><INPUT name="toppings" type="check" value="mushroom">Mushroom
	<LI><INPUT name="toppings" type="check" value="olive">Olive
	<LI><INPUT name="toppings" type="check" value="pastrami">Pastrami
	</UL>
	</FORM>

In what format should the input results be transmitted back to a server? 
Would it be agreeable to return only those inputs with different value
than the initial, and only one value for "radio" types? Thusly and in SGML:

	=========================
	FORM /service/order
	<INPUTS>
	<NAME>address
	<VALUE>147 Nearby st.

	<NAME>size
	<VALUE>medium

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>artichoke

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>olive

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>pastrami

	</INPUTS>
	=========================

Or be more verbose about it. Return all input items, like this:

	=========================
	FORM /service/order
	<INPUTS>
	<NAME>address
	<VALUE>147 Nearby st.

	<NAME>size
	<VALUE>large
	<UNCHECKED>

	<NAME>size
	<VALUE>medium
	<CHECKED>

	<NAME>size
	<VALUE>small
	<UNCHECKED>

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>artichoke
	<CHECKED>

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>mushroom
	<UNCHECKED>

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>olive
	<CHECKED>

	<NAME>toppings
	<VALUE>pastrami
	<CHECKED>

	</INPUTS>
	=========================

Or what?

Perhaps MIME would be a better wrapper instead of SGML tags? For example,
it should be easier for MIME to handle the case where the user enters 
"<VALUE>" for an input. Instead of escaping the content, MIME delimiters
are variable.

What do you think? I have input forms implemented in violaWWW, but it 
lacks a standard way of transmitting the input results back to a server.

How 'bout neither?  Forms submit queries; why not stick with the
current query syntax?  That is, 'url?query' ... with 'query' looking
something like:

        name=value&name=value&name=value

...with the '=' and '&' characters used as reserved characters
(escaped as %xx in any of the name or value strings, as usual).

This is what we're doing in Mosaic 2.0 at the moment; I was within 24
hours of sending out a message to this effect when your note arrived
:-).  See 

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html

...for details on what we're up to, but note that we're probably going
to change the checkbox handling back closer to what the HTML+
currently says.

Just name=value pairs.  Everything else is irrelevant.

We already have an escaping mechanism for queries; how 'bout we just
use that...

Following up my previous note, my suggestions leave unsolved the
problem of how to represent a situation like the above, where a single
name can have two or more values.  Two possibilities:

* Multiple name=value pairs with the name repeated each time.
* A special syntax for representing multiple values; e.g. 
  name=value|value|value

First one probably makes more sense, and parallels Pei's approach.

How about adding a expiration tag for inlined images/figures?  Something like

<img exp=never src="/mylogo.gif">

Which would allow clients to cache inlined images to disk, saving repeatedly
retrieving the same images over and over and over again, such as logo's and
Arrows/fingers/hands/feet/grooves/ears etc..  Several different types should be
available:

exp=never       (The image is good forever)
exp=immediate   (Dont bother caching it to disk, its gonna change very soon)
exp=daily       (If you havent seen this since yesterday, re-transfer it)
exp=weekly      (                        for a week)
exp=monthly     (                              month)
exp=yearly      (                              year)

...........and in fact that's what we just implemented.  For the
latest on what we're doing for prerelease 3, see:

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html

(It's changed considerably in the last couple of hours...)

Prerelease 3 will probably be released tomorrow (today -- Sunday --
whatever) for people to bang on; lots of things may not completely
work (Gopher, news, bulletproofness, etc.) but lots of things do
(including all the forms stuff detailed in that document).

Cheers,
Marc

In the sub-group that discussed this issue at W5 we had concluded that the 
method of sending the form response as part of the URL would not really 
scale elegantly in the future. Consider the form:

Your name:<INPUT name="address"><p>
5000 word essay describing why you should win the free trip to Australia:
<input name="essay" size = 80x500>

This would clearly result in monstrous URL's, yet it is not 
unrepresentative of some potential uses of forms.

Since HTTP/1.0 would support new methods in addition to GET, a 
reasonable possibility seemed the addition of a new method (say SUBMITFORM)
for submitting completed forms. Maybe the reply method should be something
that can be specified ACTION modifier of the <FORM> tag, with the possibilities 
being 

mailto:<e-mail address>     Form sent as e-mail to specified recipient
http:<address>              Indicates to return form data as a query string
submitform:<address>        Indicates to submit the form using the SUBMITFORM
                            method.

Comments?

That sounds good -- fits in with current scheme of things and allows
flexibility into the future.  I'm game...

It would be extremely nice if a set of predefined common attributes
could be defined so that you don't have to fill in your name, email
address, phone etc. by hand in every single form that comes along.
The client would recognize the attributes and supply default values
from some local configuration file.

It would also be nice if the same methods for forms could also be
used for regular email forms, so that parsers can be built to allow
widespread use for conference registration and the like.

(Clearly, this is marching in the direction of EDI, but that's a
different topic.)

Has anybody looked at how Wordperfect does their forms in their
office applications?

Somebody want to write a pseudo-spec?  Sounds interesting...

Once it's fully finalized and implemented, the current form mechanism
should support that pretty cleanly.  It is a goal...

Have a look at the Internet draft 'Encoding for Personal Contact

ideas (although I do not like the encoding all that much).

......ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/prerelease/unstable (NOTE PATH).
Source, plus binaries for Sun, IBM, SGI.

This prerelease is a major revision and provides lots of new
functionality.  It is unstable, and MANY THINGS DO NOT WORK like they
did in 2.0p2 (e.g., Gopher, binary transfer mode, transparent
uncompression, telnet/rlogin URLs, use of NCSA WAIS gateway) -- please
do not distribute this widely or install it for general use.

This prerelease is mainly of interest due to new HTTP/1.0 support,
native WAIS support, a new and improved HTML widget, fill-out forms,
and a few other things.  We encourage those of you who are interested
to bash on it and let us know what you think.

For a full listing of changes and additions, see:

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-on-version-2.0.html

Comments and feedback appreciated -- however, THIS IS UNSUPPORTED
CODE.  If you want stability, get Mosaic 1.2 (/Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries
and /Mosaic/xmosaic-source).

Definitely worthwhile. Now, a question is, should we add another
attribute into the INPUT element to specify the local default-variable? 
Or do we overload the "name" attribute to be both the INPUT identifier
*and* the default variable identifier?

It seems safer if we keep the default-variable identifiers in their own 
name space... So, I'd suggest that another attribute (say, "localvar")
be added into the INPUT element. (more HTML+ tweaking!)

This way, you'd say ``<INPUT name="org" localvar="ORGANIZATION">'',
and the local default value could (on Unix) easily get picked up from 
the environment variable "ORGANIZATION".

I'm not sure that's really necessary since the variable name wouldn't
be displayed, so a single name space seems ok. (I'm thinking of
multilingual forms here, which could still use the same 'name' fields
for automated processing.) I envision using a table read by the client
with default mappings from name to local value.

Is there a good case where the same 'name' would result in two
different 'localvar'?

I'd like to keep this simple initially, since we really don't have a 
whole lot of experience with forms-over-the-net. The simpler, the more
likely we get the parsers/translators right, not just within Xmosaic.

	I ported it to VMS.  I also ported the info.cern.ch WWWLibrary v2.09a
and WWWLineMode browser v2.06 to VMS.  You can get the modifications from my
gopher server (sci.wfeb.edu 70) in  WFEB FileServer/ (we don't have aFTP
here).  I didn't try to fix the bugs.  They're the same on VMS as on Unix:

	For both, the VAX/VMS HELP gateway (http://vxcrna.cern.ch:80/) doesn't
work.  In addition, for Lynx2-0-11:

	1) The aFTP gateway doesn't work.
	2) The TechInfo pages are not searchable.
	3) It still misses anchors in http://www.civeng.carleton.ca:8001/

Burn me for a heretic, but there is no significant difference scaling-wise
between GET <url>?essay=<5000 words> and SUBMITFORM <package including 5000
word essay>.  Both send a command, and then 5000 words over the net.

It is not a monstrous URL, because the URL is only everything up to the
'?', everything else is the form data.

If you want a separate command like SUBMITFORM because it is more logical
than overloading GET, thats fine, but lets use real reasons.

All that said, I fully agree that ACTION will need to be extended to allow

NCSA httpd version 0.5 has been released, and is on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu under
  /Web/ncsa_httpd/httpd-0.5. Version 0.5 is a maintenance release of a stable
  server before 1.0a1 (alpha of HTTP/1.0 compliant server) is released later 
  this week.

This will be the last release to support the on-the-fly gopher indexing, and
  will be the last release to support group annotation until it is 
  re-introduced in the next month or so.

Here is a copy of the README for your perusal. Any questions or inquiries
  should be mailed to httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

NCSA HTTP server
================

Beta Release 0.5

Final release for Gopher and Group Annotation features. In future releases,
  Gopher support will not reappear, and Group Annotation features will reappear
  in a more protocol-supported fashion.

This code is in the public domain. Specifically, we give to the public
domain all rights for future licensing of the source code, all resale
rights, and all publishing rights.

We ask, but do not require, that the following message be included in
all derived works:

Portions developed at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS GIVES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
FOR THE SOFTWARE AND/OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


Now that that's out of the way, we can move on to more interesting
things.

OVERVIEW
--------

    You've found the Beta release of NCSA's HTTP server. This code is
in testing and development, but is currently fully functional as a
simple HTTP server.


NEW IN RELEASE 0.5
------------------

    o Slight bug in gopher support fixed
    o Standalone support added

NEW IN RELEASE 0.4
------------------

    o Added annotation server support.  See README.GROUP-ANNOTATIONS.
    o Added access logging capability.
    o Added HTTP/1.0 compatibility (3rd+ args of GET command ignored).
    o Changed handling of full hostnames.
    o Fixed bug with index.html not being recognized unless a trailing
      slash was appended to the directory name.
    o Fixed bug with extraneous null appended to end of file data
      stream.
    o Fixed bug handling directory URL's with trailing slashes.
    o Made a little more Ultrix-friendly.

NEW IN RELEASE 0.3
------------------

    o Security hole (should be the last) fixed
    o Nearly complete drop-in gopher support. See README.GOPHER for details
    o Not being able to find the config file does not send back a path

NEW IN RELEASE 0.2
------------------

    o Two security holes fixed
    o Double slashes in root index fixed
    o Not being able to find the error files no longer hangs the server

FEATURES
--------

    o Directory aliasing and denial. The server can be configured to
map different directories to different places in the filesystem, and
easily deny access to a particular directory or file by mapping it to
something which does not exist. The interface is designed to be simple.

    o Automatic directory index files and on-the-fly index generation.
If the server finds that the client is requesting a directory, it
first checks for a file, by default called "index.html" but which can
be compiled to any name, and if it does not find such a file it
generates an HTML index of the directory and sends it back to the
client.

    o Drop-in gopher support. This server is able to automatically
interpret gopher directory structures and construct, on the fly, HTML
indexes of them. Should be faster than gopherd in HTML mode.

    o Group annotation server capabilities.  See
README.GROUP-ANNOTATIONS for more details.

    o Access logging.  See httpd.h for more details.

    o Designed to be small and low-impact: the entire source is
3,000 lines, with full gopher, annotation server, and logging support.

FUTURE PLANS
------------

    o HTTP2 (HTTP/1.0) support.

    o On the fly uncompression.

That should be all you need. E-mail problems, suggestions for features
or documentation, cash donations, food, etc. to httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu.
We encourage you to try and break the server, or compromise its
security, and let us know how you did it so we can fix it.

Neither do I.  This draft was discussed at the Amsterdam IETF at a BOF
led by Dave Crocker.  After the BOF, I volunteered to try and do better
using SGML.  A preliminary spec for "SGML-based Hirearchical Attribute-
Value Encoding" (SHAVE) exists, with a chapter on SGML-based Personal
Contact Information (SPCI).  I'm trying to get this to a state where it
is fit for public consumption - hopefully this week.  I think it is relevant
to this discussion.

Cool, ie the ACTION url is the url of an object to which
completed form should be POSTEDed. This would allow
the posting to newsgroups too as well as mailing lists
so long as we have an internally consistent semantics for POST
which I think we have.  In other words, the URL is that 

of a notional list to which the form should be added.
This in fact would allow LINK to be used instead of POST
in principle ... nothing breaks if you wnat to store your
form yourself.

==>	How about a general solution of defining in HTML+ some
	standard entities like &name; and &organisation. which
	would in ANY case be expanded in line? A particular
	use would be in the default sttings of text fields,
	but they could be used anywhere in the document.

	  Dear &name;,<p>You probably haven't thought about

How about a checklist like this:
	<INPUT name="topping" type="check" 
	       value="artichoke" localvar="PIZZA_TOPPING_artichoke">Artichoke
	<INPUT name="topping" type="check" 
	       value="mushroom" localvar="PIZZA_TOPPING_mushroom">Mushroom
	<INPUT name="topping" type="check"
 	       value="mushroom" localvar="PIZZA_TOPPING_olive">Olive
 
Where the pizza topping defaults might be this:
	% setenv PIZZA_TOPPING_artichoke checked
	% setenv PIZZA_TOPPING_olive checked
 
But, the thing that concerns me a bit about overloading 'name' is that 
it could get us into a situation where authors (or construction programs)
of input-forms must tip toe around when assigning 'name's. The authors
would have to know about the default-variables people might have, to know 
which names to use and to avoid, or risk browsers sticking in inappropriate 
default values.
 
Put it another way, I (as a form author) would like the browser to 
attempt default value substitution only if I explicitly specify
'localvar'. If I'm not sure about people's local variables, or don't
want to bother, I'd leave 'localvar' out and avoid any unintended side
effects.

Subject: HTTP 0.9 and peeking at URLs
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch
Status: RO

Jo was saying that libwww HTTP.c should be changed to look at the
URL for HTTP0.9 replies and I objected as it was a violation
of the spec which would cause real problems.

>Theoretically, it shouldn't break anything that uses proper  
HTTP/1.0.

doesn't

But it will break HTTP/0.9 which specifies that the returned
files at always HTML or plain text preceded by <PLAINTEXT>.
And specifies taht the url is opaque.

Consider the entry in a gatewayed database

	http://.../amc56.figu.88.04.gif
	
where the end gif in fact stands for "Group d'Interfaces
Foncionelles" and is a database partition. The text comming back
is

GIF8756 is the interface module responable for the interface
monitoring of the valve closure pressure release mechanisms.
It is currently
<PRE>
	ON
</PRE>

Sounds contrived but there is a valid server converting valid
url into valid documet, which would screw a clientwhich
looked at the .gif or one which looked at teh first 5 charcters.

So what do we do? I think there will in fact be servers
especially gateways which will fall into some trap like
this, as the gateways are allowed to generate the URL
any way they please. We can't say "but not use dots"
at this stage.  And we can't enforce that gateways use HTTP1.0
because the ability to make a script gateway trivially is
really neat.

The only client I think which uses this behaviour is XMosaic
which will be HTTP 1/.0 compliant soon. Servers with graphics will
have to use HTTP 1.0.  Noddy gateways to databases will still
be able to use HTTP 0.9.

Just restrain anyone from reinventing the wheel...

The code goes into the library without any modifications

Subject: problems with mosaic 2.0pre3 sun binaries?
X-Md4-Signature: fb755c1eef191e9abe136749004c034f
Status: RO

Quite a few people have reported problems with the Mosaic 2.0pre3 Sun
binaries I put on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/prerelease/unstable
last night.  

I can't reproduce any of these problems on our development Sun (which
is running SunOS 4.1.3) -- and I've verified that the binaries on the
ftp server are uncorrupted -- so I'm confused.

So, could anyone who is successfully running pre3 on a Sun with the
NCSA-supplied binaries (or self-compiled binaries, for that matter)
drop me a note?  Similarly, if you're experiencing any problems
running the binaries (coredumps, aborts, complaints about unresolved
functions at runtime, failure to resolve hostnames with the -lresolv
version, etc.), also drop me a note -- I'll try to figure out what's
going wrong and fix it asap.

Thanks much,
Marc

I've noticed that a lot of documents have zero or one hypertext link in
them and then we have "navigation" nodes that tie everything together.
While I'm not surprised at this trend I think that if we don't do something
to change it the Web will not scale well and we will end up with islands
of information instead of a web.  If we are to have true hypertext then
we need some way to have users augment this structure leaving behind "snail
trails" for future users to follow.

I think it should be possible to analyze server logs (once browers support
``Referer: URL'' that is) and extract some of this information.  LINK
commands could then be used to extend the structure beyond the local
server.  This could fit in very nicely with Web robots.

Hope this is some food for thought.

I too am interested in this problem. We have started here at our site to put
together some interactive slide-show control programs. They are written in
Tk/Tcl, and give X-based control over a slide-show. These can either be
timed, so that every so often a new "slide" is displayed ( This slide can
be any URL that XMosaic can handle), and also allows for multiple items to be 
forked. 
Also, it can be used as a slide player, with Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind and
Forward buttons. Future additions will include sequencing to sounds  and 
movies.

This is still very beta, but any interest should be directed to
	jcasey@maths.tcd.ie OR creilly@maths.tcd.ie (authors)

Any discussion on features that could/should be incorporated would be
welcome.

Devil's advocate: maybe terminal documents are a good thing.  In
the Gopher community, virtually everyone feels a need to build
links to other Gopher servers.  The result is several hundred
different ways of setting up paths to each other -- both to
root Gophers, and to interesting documents within various servers.

A few months ago, the Merit Network mounted a Gopher for the
Chronicle of Higher Ed, a US publication that's followed closely
in academe.  This Gopher server is the first I've found with zero
outside links.  It stands on its own.

I find this very appealing.  If other single-topic servers followed
the same model, we could end up with a division of labor, where some
servers have a goal of providing unique documents, and others have
the goal of organizing Gopher documents within a subject area, and
others have the goal of organizing the subject Gophers.

If, instead, everybody tries to organize every relevant resource
on the net, then it seems to me that's what won't scale.  I realize
the notion of the Web emphasizes interconnectedness, but clients do
offer easy ways to leap to well-known documents with links elsewhere.

I have no argument with this approach, in fact, this is the way it's
*supposed* to work.  What is missing is the ability for users to be able
to easily augment this structure by adding links to the Chronicle of Higher
Ed from organizing documents that the Merit Network people may have no
clue exists.  I'm not coming out of left field here, this is how hypertext
is designed to work.  All we are missing is the implementation (the
LINK command is in the spec for doing just this).

The current solution is to send lots of email around by hand which
is suboptimal (considering that you can't find the owners of a lot
of documents).  Annotations do not solve this problem either.

My thinking was to have the server that provides the document indicate
the "next document" and/or "previous document" that most user go to or
come from.

I've noticed that a lot of documents have zero or one hypertext link in

While I'm not surprised at this trend I think that if we don't do something
to change it the Web will not scale well and we will end up with islands
of information instead of a web.  If we are to have true hypertext then
we need some way to have users augment this structure leaving behind "snail
trails" for future users to follow.

I think it should be possible to analyze server logs (once browers support
``Referer: URL'' that is) and extract some of this information.  LINK
commands could then be used to extend the structure beyond the local
server.  This could fit in very nicely with Web robots.

Hope this is some food for thought.

It seems that what would be really nice would be to have some kind of
programmatic interface, so that a document becomes ever-so-slightly
differently structured when the user has come from a particular
place to the current document.  Perhaps links could have a *simple*
programming language associated with them (if-then-else, variables), and
clicking on a link could set a variable that could be tested for at
a later time.  It would seem that this would give maximum generality,
even though it would be a serious divergence from the current model, requiring
significantly greater interaction with browsers.  Such interaction could
easily be made optional, however.. ^_^

Are there any good uses for having href/link's that do something different
according to the user's navigation history that is not addressed by the
LINK spec?  I confess to being largely ignorant of LINKs, but I wanted
to throw out this notion..

Major problem with HTTP/1.0 and HTTP0 in the same client:

Sending a HTTP/1.0 request to a HTTP0 server can result in problems
with the client and server are sufficiently far apart on the network,
apparently because of the following:

(a) Client sends 'GET /foobar HTTP/1.0' CR LF.
(b) Server says, aha, I'm supposed to send data, and starts sending.
(c) Clinet sends the rest of the HTTP/1.0 request, including the
    Accept fields, etc., followed by the HTTP/1.0 terminating (end of
    request) blank line.

The result is that the socket gets confused and the client only ends
up getting the first chunk of data (usually 1024 bytes).

Lots of people are seeing this with Mosaic 2.0p3, and Bill Perry's
Emacs client hits the same situation in some cases.  So it seems to be
general enough to be a real pain in the butt...

Any ideas?

Possibilities I see:

(a) Everyone upgrade to HTTP/1.0 pronto, and everyone forget about
    HTTP0 forever.
(c) Change all existing HTTP0 servers to catch the HTTP/1.0 request
    field when it's sent and wait for the rest of the HTTP/1.0 request
    to come through (but ignore it).
(c) Change HTTP/1.0 to only send a single CR LF in the entire
    request datastream.

None of these seem palatable to me.  Thoughts?

Thanks,
Marc

This all sounds great!  New stuff in 2.0pre3 and later include the
ability to pull down images, sounds, etc. without having the display
go out to lunch, scrolling directives, etc.  Please send me feedback
as to what Mosaic can do to help y'all...

Subject: one problem with mosaic 2.0pre3, and ramifications
X-Md4-Signature: 3efffc6c178416d0ca9504caaae62401
Status: RO

A number of people have found that Mosaic 2.0pre3 will dump core when
talking to certain servers where such a server is both HTTP/1.0 and in
one's WWW_HOME (or equivalent) specification.

Such a coredump is triggered by the fact that the server is returning
an HTML document as type 'application/binary' when it should be
'text/html' -- i.e., the server is misconfigured.  2.0pre3 gets
confused (it's expecting something it can display, and it can't
display application/binary -- whereas it can display text/html, etc.)
and pukes.

While this coredump while be fixed in pre4, Mosaic and other HTTP/1.0
clients still won't know what to do with application/binary files
(besides simply offering to save them to disk).

So, the moral of the story is -- if you're running a HTTP/1.0 server
(Plexus 2.x, CERN httpd 2.x, ??... NCSA httpd 1.0 with HTTP/1.0
support is coming soon), now would be a very good time to check and
make sure that your server is properly configured and is returning
proper MIME types.

One way to do this, without Mosaic 2.0pre3, is to telnet to your
server on port 80 (or wherever) and ask for your home page:

        GET /whatever HTTP/1.0 [return]

The 2.11 release of the library has a bunch of bug fixes (especially
with respect to binary transfers).  It compiles on the
usual set of unix platforms, but is not extensively tested..
people have been asking for a more up-to-date version
so there it is. There are a lot more thins due in the
next release including the W5's wish list.

Hi Steve, 

In your conference notes you write:

> global index/resource discovery 
>         walking the web is bad 
>         servers reporting their contents is good

Has there been any more discussion on this? It seems there already is a real
requirement for this. There are already more HTML meta libraries than I know
what to do with, and most of these are maintained (or not) by hand. In the
future there may be nice solutions with X.500, whois++, URN's etc, but in the
meantime...

It seems to me that if we can define a simple format and a standard relative
HTTP pathname of a document describing the contents of servers the maintenance
of meta libraries can be easily automated, in an archie-like way.

Is there any interest in this? Would people be prepared to keep such a
contents page up to date?

Can somebody enlighten me on how whois++ fits in?

Have you seen the Internet Draft "draft-ietf-wnils-whois-01.txt",
aka "Architecture of the Whois++ Index Service" ? ...

  This document details a distributed, easily maintained architecture for
  providing a unified index to a large number of distributed WHOIS++
  servers. This architecture can be used with systems other than WHOIS++ to
  provide a distributed directory service which is also searchable.

Status: RO

Just curious as to what the status of the table is in html+ after the
W^5?

I heard that most people were concerned with it taking two passes to
parse a table.  Although this isn't a hideous problem (I have 
rudimentary table support in my emacs browser), it would be nice not
to have to do it. :)

Has anyone proposed something similar to LaTeX's tabular environment?
This has to have a 'template' at the beginning saying how many columns
there are and how they are justified.  This would solve the problem of
how many columns there are without parsing the thing twice.

I would propose a new attribute for the TBL tag - COLUMNS=#, where #
would be how many columns the table should be formatted as.  <TH> and
<TD> would still have the colspan, rowspan, and align attributes.

Would anyone have any major objections to this?  Alternatives?

-Bill P.

Subject:  Bugfix for VMS Daemon
Status: RO

Hi,

I have had problems installing the VMS daemon 2.07 on a VMS platform.

I think I have solved this problem - I have attach to this E-mail the HTFile.c
source with modifications I have made to the source.  I have linked it with the
original WWWLIB2.06 found in CERN (With no other modifications).

The corrections are marked with "DR SEP 93"


Thanks

Dudu

Marc,

One of the things that I meant to comment about which might really be
appropriate probably for the folks at Berkeley is an mpeg_player with
similar controls to audiotool. I know, this has nothing to do with
mosaic but I thought I'd pass this thought to this distribution.

Maybe something like this already exist and I am not aware.

As far as a slide show is concerned, I second the motion to have something
like this capability
	Play/Pause
	Stop
	Rewind

How can I observe this with 2.0Pre3?

}This all sounds great!  New stuff in 2.0pre3 and later include the
}ability to pull down images, sounds, etc. without having the display
}go out to lunch, scrolling directives, etc.

Cheers,

     As far as a slide show is concerned, I second the motion to have something
     like this capability
     	Play/Pause
     	Stop
     	Rewind
     	Forward
     

I'm not sure that James was as clear as he could have been about this. The
idea is that we define a "sequence" which is used to index where in the
presentation we are. Initially we intend implementing slide sequences and
time sequences. MPEG, and audio sequences are in the future I'm afraid,
especially audio, because we don't have access to a machine with sound
capabilities right now.

As an example, take a slide sequence. The "control document" would look
like:

	#20 second clocked sequence as intro.
	sequence clock 20 {
	frame 1 {get title_page.ps}
	frame 10 {get credits.ps}
	}
	#Now a slide sequence.
	sequence http {
		get http:demo_slide1
		get http:demo_slide2
		get http:demo_slide3
			.
			.
			.
		get http:demo_slide19
		get http:demo_slide20
	} {
		frame 1 {get http:intro.mpeg}
		frame 10 {get http:inaction.gif}
		frame 20 {get http:finishing.ps}
	}

which defines the slides to be shown and the actions associated with
certain slides.

Rewind, pause and play buttons would then apply to the underlying sequence
- not very useful on a slide sequence, but on a timed sequence like the
introduction above, quite useful. 

Now making this work for mpegs etc. is quite difficult.

Also the other problem is that we need to have some way of finding out
when the displays start happening - i.e. when the picture is actually
displayed. At the moment a big picture might not have been displayed by
the time the timed sequence has finished - quite distressing. Any ideas?
Waiting for the window to be mapped is the best guess I can think of
right now, but it would be nice if the display programs could send back
signals when they're ready.

Any ideas?

Correct if i am wrong in saying that HTTP is a stateless protocol. ANd what
you mentioned above represent different states to me.

In HTTP, you simply do a GET to fetch the html document. Well behaved clients
are not supposed to wait for user action before reading the whole document.

WHat you seem to be suggesting is that first we fetch the whole audio
clip or movie clip and then perform all the above operations. This will 
work but only in the short run (while the movie/audio clips are short). 
A more scalable solution would involve interactively controlling the stream 
while it is being fetched without first caching the whole lenght of data 
stream on clients local disk. 

This would however involve integrating state-based support to HTTP. But we 
need to be careful if we decide to do that. Maybe this is not what you had
in mind !

Well, I'll start this off.

In private conversation with me, Marc has convinced me that HTTP0 is
useful enough for quick shell script special purpose servers that we need
to keep it around as a viable protocol.  That being the case.  It is also
vital that HTTP/1.0 clients still be able to talk to these servers.

I feel we need to bite the bullet and be willing to change one of these
protocols.  Both are already somewhat established, and changing either
of them will require the cooperation of all the current browser and server
writers.

1)  To change the HTTP/1.0 protocol to use a different separator between 
    accept fields, and to use CR LF as a terminator.  This means getting new
    versions of all the servers and clients, and also means getting all
    existing HTTP/1.0 servers upgraded.  Anyone know the install base
    out there?  This will cause lots of user headaches until all the servers
    get upgraded.

2)  Change HTTP0.  As I understand it, an HTTP0 server right now, to
    process an HTTP/1.0 request reads first the command (Usually GET),
    Then the URL.  It throws away everything from the URL to CR LF.
    We could modify this slightly to instead throw away eveything up
    to the terminator for HTTP/1.0 (Which I think is CR LF CR LF).
    This would mean upgrading all the current HTTP0 servers and shell
    scripts.  It should be an easy update, just change the terminating
    sequence.  The biggest headache here is what to do about old HTTP0
    clients.  They would hang on the new HTTP0 servers, because they would
    never send the right terminating sequence.  Are their any browsers
    out there that are not planning to move to HTTP/1.0 in the coming year?

If the number of HTTP/1.0 servers is small (less than 200), then I would
prefer option 1.  If both have about equal server numbers I would prefer
option 2, because I would rather cause headaches for users of old
(out-of-date) software than for users of our new stuff. (I.E.  Everyone
we have already sold on HTTP/1.0).  For document writers who have to deal
with stubborn old servers who refuse to upgrade, we could add a http0://
url type to the browser that would always talk that protocol.  Of course
this will break all the current documents that assume all http is created
equal.


Any other opinions?

	Eric

But won't this require 2 round trips for every document.  First ask
the server its HTTP version, then send the request.  Massive slowdown
it seems to me.

Worse than that, clients that CAN take HTTP/1.0 will wait for a
REAL LONG TIME for HTTP0 servers to identify themselves.  ;-)

I think the client is getting ENOTCONN when the server does the close.
You could work around this by detecting ENOTCONN and retrying without
"HTTP/1.0".  For performance you would probably want to cache a list of
HTTP0 servers (though I wouldn't bother keeping it around between sessions).

I don't think \r\n is the problem.  Just set the connection to unbuffered
(I'll bet you have it line buffered now) and flush when done building the
request.  However, I think you still get bitten if it fragments going out.

Maybe someone with more TCP knowledge could dig into this and figure out
another solution.

It may be possible to get rid of this headache, by having modified HTTP0
servers look for the blank line as a terminator *only* if the HTTP/1.0
protocol identifier is part of the GET request on the first line.  The idea
is that an HTTP0 request:

  GET /some/url/or/other[CRLF]

is handled as before, while an HTTP/1.0 request

  GET /some/url/or/other HTTP/1.0[CRLF]
  More: headers go here[CRLF]
  [CRLF][CRLF]

is (properly) slurped up completely before the server starts sending back
data.

Or am I missing something?  :-|...

   Actually, no.  When you make the connection to the server, it
automatically spits it out as a 'hello' message.  Just have the
browsers wait for one line of output, then parse it to see if it
accepts http/1.0 requests, then send the appropriate request.  It
might mean a slight slowdown for sites halfway around the globe, but
then the connection won't be blazingly fast anyway. :)

   I had always wondered why this wasn't in the HTTP spec, since most
of the other protocols seem to use it (SMTP, NNTP, POP, etc).

   The only problem would be re-releasing new versions of the clients,
but thats no big deal.  It would be critical to time the release of
new clients with the installation of the new servers, or else things
like GIFS and compressed images would be totally screwed.

I'm having a devil of a time trying to reproduce the error; can anybody give
me a specific client + server combination that reproduces the bug?  How "far
away" do the client + server have to be on the network?

It seems unlikely that UNIX TCP/IP has such a large bug in it.  I'd
at least like to see if anything can be done on the client end before
we change servers or protocol specs.

This seems to reproduce it about 90% of the time.  Create a 2961 byte
file as /tmp/xx (works for me, you may need it larger or smaller
for your system).  Oh, I'm running the server and client on the
same system so that's no problem.

% ./client localhost:9999

I'm getting a SIGPIPE instead of ENOTCONN, but it may be that
I'm seeing another side of the same problem.  Anyway, this is
something for others to play around with in the meantime.
I'll dig some more (maybe some packet traces will tell more).

One reason might be that this kind of wart makes it much harder to port
the HTTP protocol to a non-connection-based (say, message-based RPC)
transport layer.

I don't see diffs anywhere on info.cern.ch... am I missing something?

So, of course, after sending my note of a few minutes ("I know Eric
disagrees with me"), I see he pretty much agrees with me... (we had a
pretty volatile lunchtime discussion over this today, at the end of
which I was convinced we weren't agreeing on anything :-).  So yeah, I
like (2) and (if necessary) the http0 URL type.

That's what I get for reading my mail backwards...

I'll try to pursue both of Tony's suggestions this weekend in Mosaic.
If neither solves the problem completely, I suggest as the easiest
solution that we require that existing HTTP0 servers *at least* be
upgraded to be able to accept full, multiline HTTP/1.0 queries, even
if they can't understand them.

If backward compatibility for HTTP0 servers is essential and such a
required partial upgrade situation wouldn't be acceptable, I then
suggest that browsers begin supporting a "http0:" URL type for the
sole purpose of communicating with old servers.

I make these specific suggestions because I think that changing either
HTTP0 or HTTP/1.0 at this point would be much more painful -- HTTP0
has served us well and is ideal for what it is (very simple, very
lightweight, and very easy to build shell scripts around -- my
proposed partial upgrade situation described above should leave those
qualities intact), and HTTP/1.0 is already achieving critical mass (by
virtue of Plexus and CERN httpd 2.x) and clients are already either
supporting it or will very soon.

I know Eric already disagrees with me already, and I'm sure others
will too, and I'm flexible on this -- *however*, I think we need to
value cohesion and stability more than almost any other factor at this
point, particularly as we are in the midst of a successful move to
HTTP/1.0 (which provides lots of expansion room into the future).

Cheers,
Marc

The proposed solution (most nested paragraph above) is indeed not
tenable; the mutual client/server identification that's a part of
HTTP/1.0 and (ya gotta hope) later revisions of HTTP covers this
aspect of the situation anyway, while only requiring one round trip.

Pei Wei raises the issue of how to transfer forms data between clients
and servers. I posted one approach some time ago for doing this within
the existing URL spec for search strings.

This makes use of the permitted special characters in search strings to
delimit attribute/value pairs:

        FormData ::=    name@value [! FormData]

Multivalued attributes are represented by several such name@value pairs
(one pair per <input> element on the form).

If space, @ or ! occurs in the name or value then each occurence should be
escaped with %20 %25 or %21 respectively following the normal convention of a
% followed by the hexadecimal code of the respective character. It is perhaps
advisable to avoid such characters in the attribute name itself.

An alternative approach based on mail-type headers could work as:

        AttributeValue: name value

This header is repeated as necessary for each field in the form.


What do you think?

Seems fine to me, and I want to drop my proposal to use @ and ! 

Marc further suggests allowing a given name to be repeated with
different values for attributes with multiple values.

This means you get one name=value pair per <input> field.

Following feedback from W^5 I propose to drop the <tb> element, andv to change
the table caption tag from <tt> to <tblcap> to avoid confusion with <tt> for
switching to a fixed pitch font in HTML.

I initially considered an attribute format for single pass rendering, but
found that it gets kinda complicated when you realise that you need different
formats for headers and data. Including just the number of colummns isn't
enough (and anyway it is cheap to work out).

The simple prepass mechanism is low cost and is only needed once,
since thereafter you use the cached info.

Wait, I don't understand.  HTTP0 is just Gopher plus some extra
characters, right?  That is, the Gopher request

    <obscure_path_name>

and the HTTP0 request

    GET <obscure_path_name> HTTP/1.0

are functionally equivalent.

Yes, there are good reasons for wanting a protocol that is very
simple, very lightweight, and very easy to build shell scripts
around--but given that we have one already (with a far wider installed
base), I don't understand why we need to maintain an extra one.

Hi,

I'm writing an HTML parser and have been looking through what
I think are the relevant docs. I'm a bit confused about what
kind of nesting is allowable in HTML. There are implications 
that it should be allowed in some case but not others.

In this example--

<h1>one <em>two</em> three</h1>
<h2>one <em>two</em> three</h2>

are the two's rendered differently? (They are in xmosaic anyway...)

Could someone explain, or point me to documentation that would
clarify?

thanks,

Mosaic doesn't yet have dynamic font support (the ability to merge a
large bold font with the italic attribute on the fly); it might for
2.0 if Eric has time to add it... (so the answer is, they should
be...)

  I've added host-level access control to plexus-2.2.1.  You can find
the patch under

ftp://austin.bsdi.com/plexus/2.2.1/contrib/host-level-access-control/

Below are checksums for the files, the .tar.Z file contains the other two.
64134     1 README.access-control
36197    19 plexus-2.2.1-host-level-access-control.patch
49361    11 plexus-2.2.1-host-level-access-control.tar.Z

This code uses a configuration file to permit/deny access to specific
hosts.  The syntax of the config file is included below.  I will be
extending this code to provide for resource-level access control and to
port it to plexus-3.0.  If anyone has any comments/suggestions regarding
the config file format, now is the time.
  Of course, the resource-level control will only be effective if we have
some secure means of authentication.  I don't have any plans to work on
kerberos support yet, but we'll see...

plexus-2.2.1 access control configuration file format:

# In the syntax below:
#     'x'	denotes the character x, literally
#     *		denotes "repeat the previous pattern 0 or more times"
#     +		denotes "repeat the previous pattern 1 or more times"
#     x|y       denotes "select one of the terms x or y"
#     {xyz}	denotes "select one of x, y, or z"
#     {x-y}	denotes "select one from the range x to y, inclusive"
#     [item]	denotes item is optional
#     
# Format:
#     method_list host_spec_list
# where 
#     method_list --> method[','method]
#         method --> one of the methods defined via %method in
#                    plexus.conf (get, textsearch, ...)
#     host_spec_list --> host_spec[','host_spec_list]
#         host_spec --> ['!']{host_name|host_address|partial_spec|ALL|NONE}
#             host_name --> alpha[alphanum]*['.'host_ext]
#                 host_ext --> alphanum+['.'host_ext]
#             host_address --> {0-9}+['.'host_address]
#             partial_spec --> '.'alphanum+['.'partial_spec]
#                     alphanum --> {a-z}|{A-Z}|{0-9}|'-'
#
# ALL and NONE
#   The special symbol "ALL" indicates that all hosts, by default,
# should have access to the corresponding methods.  Special symbol
# "NONE" # disallows access for all hosts not explicitly matched. 
# These settings override the %DEFAULT_ACCESS array which is set in
# plexus.conf and which otherwise has the same affect.  Note that
# (!ALL == NONE) and (!NONE == ALL).
#
# Netgroups
# Note: it would be nice to add netgroups to this spec, but first we gotta
# get setnetgrent, getnetgrent, and endnetgrent into perl.  This could be
# implemented via the "syscall" function perhaps.  Proposed syntax for
# netgroups:
#         host_spec --> host_name|host_address|partial_spec|netgroup
#             netgroup --> '@'alphanum+

Subject: Announcing Access Authorization Documentation
Status: RO


The pre-release of WWW Access Authorization Documentation has
been hung to the Web:

    WWW Project Home Page / Technical / Access Authorization

or URL:
 
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/AccessAuthorization/Overview.html
 
Telnet-level protection is already operational, and most probably
makes it to the next release of the WWW Library.
 
What AA did to the Library?
        5 new modules:
                HTAABoth.*, HTAAServ.*, HTAABrow.*,
                HTAAFile.*, and HTUU.*
        Some files modified:
                HTUtils.html, HTRules.*, HTFile.c, HTTP.c, HTAlert.c
 
CERN LineMode Browser compiled beautifully with the new library, and
CERN httpd needed only clear additions (unlike Tim said, servers *do*
need to be modified, it wouldn't be possible otherwise).
 
In the to-be-released version the file HTAlert.c contains a function
prompting username and password (without echoing). GUI browsers have
to provide their own version of that, but it should be the only
addition that has to be made.
 
If you have any comments, especially about telnet-level protection,
now is the time. The documentation also contains preliminary
specification of encryption-level protection. Feel free to comment
that, too.

Subject: Your views on changes to HTML+
To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Date: Fri, 10 Sep 93 17:08:40 BST
Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.36.1.1]
Status: RO

I would really value your input on possible changes to HTML+ following the
www workshop and subsequent discussions on www-talk. I hope to produce a
second draft within a couple of weeks for comments. When we are happy with
the revised spec, I will then put it forward to the IETF for consideration as
an internet draft.

HTML+ is positioned as a simple format especially suited to the needs of the
World Wide Web, with a wider range of features than the earlier HTML format,
e.g. tables, forms, figures, equations, and improved support for dividing
large works into a number of smaller nodes.


Supporting large works, e.g. books
----------------------------------

The existing draft is too concise and needs worked out examples of how
books and other large works can be broken up into a number of separate
nodes. The features for implicit and explicit navigation links need
further explanation, and offer a way of making available vast quantities
of works for which the copyright has now expired, and which would be too
large as individual nodes. The general idea is to allow toolbars to show
navigation buttons dependent on the node in question. This would work well
even for scanned documents with each page as a separate node.

A node could be designated as the top level with the order of links in this
node implying the prev/next sequence for reading its contents. Alternatively,
a more general hierarchy can be defined analogous to printed books with a
table of contents (TOC) as just another node. In this case, the prev/next
sequence is defined independently of the TOC. The GROUP tag is used to define
hierarchical structures independently of node boundaries. (I would also like
to rename GROUP to SECT to make its role more obvious).


Tables
------

Minor changes only, <tbl> to be replaced by <table> and <tt> by <tblcap>.
<tb> to be dropped. The performance fears due to the need for a pre-pass
seem to be unwarranted, since this information can be cached and used for
resizing and scrolling.


Figures
-------

Due to lack of interest and to ensure simplicity, the <FIGT> element for
overlays is to be dropped. It could be reinstated in future versions of HTML+.
Some people at w^5 suggested that <IMG> be used to define the image content
for figures. I am against this as the IMG align attribute (top, middle,
bottom) is quite different from that of FIG (left, center, right). It also
avoids having to add alignment attributes to the EMBED tag.


Lists
-----

As currently drafted HTML+ doesn't allow DL lists within UL and OL lists.
Some people have complained that this is unnecessarily restrictive.

O'Reilly & Associates have suggested we give authors greater control over
lists perhaps inspired by the DocBook DTD. Thus for UL lists we could
support mark=bullet, dash, box, check or a URL/URN for an icon. A small set
of standard symbols would be useful. For ordered lists, we may want to
allow authors to select the style: Arabic (1,2, 3), UpperAlpha (A, B, C)
and LowerRoman (i, ii, iii) etc. Alternatively, authors should be allowed
to specify the sequence identifier as an attribute e.g. <LI ITEM="c)">

For unordered lists, a new attribute wrap=horiz or wrap=vert would allow
multicolumn lists to be wrapped appropriately. For the second case with N
items in the list, the current window size determines the number of columns C,
and each column then has the N/C items (as in a standard Unix ls command).
This mechanism requires a simple pre-pass to establish the column width and
total number of items. This information can be cached as for tables. 


Normal text
-----------

The line break tag <BR> is to be dropped in favour of a <L>....</L> element
which can take an ID as used in the TEI DTD. This gives greater flexibility
for identifying lines e.g. in old texts.

Perhaps the DTD should require authors to use a <P> element rather than
allowing naked %text;


Emphasis
--------

At the www workshop, some people complained that the EM element was
overloaded and should be split up. Perhaps we should move to something closer
to HTML with a small set of presentation specific tags plus a wider set of
logical tags, e.g.

    Presentation specific tags:

        <I>, <B>, <U>, <S> for italic, bold, underline and strike-thru

        These could be nested and optionally take a role attribute.

    Bibliographic tags:

        <author>, <cite>, <isbn>, ...

    Computer Documentation tags:

        <cmd>, <opt>, <kbd>, <var>, <dfn>, ...

    Miscellaneous tags:

        <sub>, <sub>, <footnote>, <margin>

The logical tags could be an open ended set with their rendering controlled
via associated style sheets. This approach means that browsers can simply
ignore such tags and render their contents as normal text, unless otherwise
directed. In general unknown tags should be ignored and their contents parsed
as if the tag wasn't present. This also applies to unknown attributes.


Changes to documents
--------------------

In addition to the change bar elements, there are two new elements for legal
documents:  <added> and <removed> rendered as strike-thru and italic text
respectively (along with optional colour cues).

Many thanks,

Dave Raggett

Ari,
  I've read through your documentation and it looks good except for
one issue: there is no provision for controlling access *per method*.
Once we have implemented the PUT and POST methods of HTTP, I expect
it will be quite common for a webmaster to wish to allow for many
readers relative to the number of writers for a particular resource.
  I suggest that you add a <methods> field to the .www_acl file, such as

    method,method,...:template: group,user,group,...

or some other syntax.  Alternatively, you could specify the methods in
the rule file, but the access list seems a better place to me.
  Also, could you clarify some thing for me?  Regarding the <template>
specified in the protect rule of the rule file and also in each entry of
the access control list: Does this <template> refer only to files or can
it be a subdirectory - the latter indicating that the entire hierarchy
is to be accessible only to those in the corresponding user/group list?
Here are the pertinent references:

In <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/AccessAuthorization/RuleFile.html> you
write

    The protect rule has two forms unifrom with those of the pass rule: 

	    protect <template>

    The filename matching the <template> is protected...

and also in 
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/AccessAuthorization/AccessControlList.html>,

    template is the name of a file in that directory

At the just-concluded Davenport meeting, at which we reviewed
the Docbook DTD, we reluctantly came to the conclusion to use
CALS, as it's supported by SGML tools and as there isn't much
to choose among other table models.  It follows that you might
want to look at the way CALS does table formatting, because 
people might have tools to construct such tables without haveing
(having) to code them by hand.

   Hello Christopher,

First, thank you for going through the documentation and for your reply!

I couldn't agree with you more. I will add this to the final version,
but I think I put the template first:

    template:method,method,...:group,user,group,...

because it seems most logical, doesn't it?


>   Also, could you clarify some thing for me?  Regarding the <template>

> Here are the pertinent references:

The <template> in ACL file in each directory matches *only* files 
in *that* directory. The reasons are the following:

	* if I had a file /a/b/c, and the ACL entry in the directory /a
	  would restrict access to c somehow, but this restriction wouldn't
	  be in the ACL in directory /a/b (because it would be redundant),

		* first of all, we would always have to go through
		  every ACL file in the way down the hierarchy
		  (a performance problem)

		* but also, and more importantly, someone on the
		  same machine could make a soft link to directory b
		  so that he could access file c for example like:
		  /foo/bar/b/c and this way ACL file in directory /a
		  would be never consulted (a security hole)

	      [ * Note also, that soft links still pose a problem,
		  as described in:

    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/AccessAuthorization/LinkDiscussion.html

		  and are the reason for "fork" rule (or servers on
		  multiple ports). ]


All the ACL information could be put to rule file, but this would make
the rule file too big and slow down servers unnecessarily. Therefore
it is better to distribute ALC information into each directory.

On the other hand, we could manage without the "protect" rule, but
in that case we would also have to have an entry for public file in
the ACL, and therefore each site starting to use the new httpd would
have to make dozens of these dummy ACL files containing something like:

	get:*:anybody

Someone might say: why not treat a file not in ACL as public, but
this would be a BIG security risk, because somebody might forget to
put an entry for a REALLY secret file, and then it would be treated
as public. I rather have it like it is: if there is no entry in ACL,
access is 403 Forbidden, meaning that giving access authorization
does not help. Anybody oppose to that?

The semantics of the "protect" rule is therefore just to inform the
server, that the ACL file should be consulted. Without that directive
the server will bypass Access Authorization, and work exactly like all
the current httpds do. Clean.

Note: in my opinion this should go the other way around: Access Authorization
      should normally be always on, and there should be some special rule,
      something like "bypass" that would explicitly tell that files in these
      directories are public. This way forgetting to "protect" something
      wouldn't result in files becoming exposed, but rather inaccessible to
      everybody. However, I cannot tamper with the semantics for "pass", and
      I believe this "protect" thing will work well enough.

 Gateway WWW-ACEDB
 =================

 If you want to consult biologic databases, try :

   * "http://moulon.inra.fr/acedb/acedb.html" to consult "A Caenorhabditis
elegans Data Base" (ACeDB).

   * "http://moulon.inra.fr/acedb/mycdb.html" to consult "Mycobacterium
DataBase". "Mycobacterium DataBase" is funded by the WHO and the Fondation
Raoul Follereau and is maintained by the Unite de Genetique Moleculaire
Bacterienne at the Institut Pasteur.

 
 ACEDB is the database program written for the nematode genome project by
Richard Durbin (rd@mrc-lmc.cam.ac.uk), and Jean Thierry-Mieg
(mieg@kaa.cnrs-mop.fr).


 To consult these databases, you can : 

    * If you know syntax of ACEDB commands, enter your query in "SearchText".
    * otherwise you can make a complete Consultation of the database.  

 For more precisions, about ACEDB syntax, just enter "help".


 If you want to create an ACEDB gateway, see (or contact me) :

          "http://moulon.inra.fr/acedb_conf_eng.html" 
                             ou
          "http://moulon.inra.fr/acedb_conf.html"  (version francaise)


Notes
-----

 * With "SearchText", you can enter ACEDB commands, NOT keywords.

 * for users of CERN WWW browser : "FIND" is also a command of ACEDB, if
you want to use it, you must enter "FIND FIND ...". Example :

            FIND FIND Chromosome

Subject: Access Authorization
Status: RO


Pardon me if I am re-hashing a previous discussion - I am a new 
subscriber to this list.

I read the documents concerning WWW Access Authorization. I don't
agree with the contention that web-based documents won't need strictly
authenticated access control. Here at EINet we use a Kerberos-based
authentication system to establish identities for access control.  This
method requires bilateral, encrypted communication on the socket to be
used for information transmission.  (For best results, the
transmission itself would also be encrypted, but we can talk about
that later.) We don't believe this is too difficult *or* too slow for
use in the web.

Leaving out the message termination stuff (I wish we *could* ;-), the request
message might look something like: 

	GET /some/document Authorization: KerberosV4

If the server does *not* support this form of authorization, it returns
the "HTTP/1.0 401" status code along with the name of an
authentication scheme it supports (as is proposed).

If the server *does* support this form of authentication, it returns a
"please continue" status, and *holds the connection*. The client and
server then both call the appropriate Kerberos functions for mutual
authentication.  The authentication is conducted over the open
connnection, using encrypted communcation. If authentication succeeds,
the server uses the authenticated identity to conduct the access
authorization, and either returns the requested data or an error
status.

The reason the authentication protocol must be conducted over the same
connection as the data transmission is that the server cannot be
absolutely sure from one connection to the next whether it is talking
to the same client. That's the whole point of authentication, after
all.

Subject: URN/URL file links
Status: RO

One idea I've batted around for a while is putting a single URL or URN
(when available) in a file (so it would be a one line text file) and then
name the file with the link name that would normally appear in the body of
a HTML document or on an anon-ftp site. Then a small application (or maybe
the various WWW clients) could be used that would be able to "launch" the
file and invoke an appropriate viewer for .au, .mpeg, .ps, etc. then the
application would quit; sort of drag and drop on Macs, hopefully a quick
perl script in Unix. If possible, a user should be able to launch multiple
copies of the application to get multiple files simultaneously. The
extension in DOS, Unix, etc. would obviously be .urn or .url depending on
the file content.

The application ideally would be small, no viewing or editing, only
settings for which viewers to invoke after the application had retrieved
the document. This would be a simple way of extending any OS file system
with URLs and URNs. The penalty would be the minimum file size of the disk
the file is stored on. This has implications for Hotlists in Mosaic and
other WWW clients, because a given OS hierarchical file system would
provide the organizational control for the files containing the URLs and
URNs. Normal soft and hard links, aliases, etc. to the file could still be
used to put the references into multiple folder/directory categories. This
would also work for providing indirect links via FTP or the local file
system. For example, a single file at CERN might contain the URL pointing
to the latest PostScript version of the draft URL spec. (url5.ps, url6.ps,
etc.). HTML and HTML+ documents would point to the "url.url" file at CERN,
which when retrieved would get you the latest version of the draft.

Finally, the Web doesn't support two way links such as you might find in an
Object Oriented Database. The double indirection approach will hopefully
take care of part of the problem with references to specific versions of
files which leave lots of invalid links around the Web; the HTML and HTML+
specs. don't specify a way of dealing with two way links at this point. I
suspect that this kind of approach may also take away a lot of need for
specific gopher clients, since you won't need a gopher client to present a
directory to you to retrieve a lot of common net objects, the directory
will already be provided by the OS.

My apologies, indeed two way links are possible with the REL and REV
attributes of an anchor. More discussion about those attributes would be
worthwhile, so that everyone can understand the implications of two way
links.

Where can I find the new XMosaic resource list? (I am referring to

I am using 2.0 PRE 3 and I cannot get it to use the correct audiotool.

Thanks.

You do can do some authentication using a single request.

Here is what I think you want for more complex protocols.  Note that this
is a departure from the current proposal because putting the authorization
scheme after "401" code is too limiting.  Consider this a request to
change the proposal.

client:
    GET /document HTTP/1.0\r\n
    \r\n
server:
    HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
    Authenticate: External-KerberosIV, realm="bsdi.com",priciple="foo"
    Authenticate: PK-reverse, principle="joe's-computers"
    Authenticate: basic; kerberos

Example of OUT-OF-BAND Authentication
=====================================

client:
    GET /document HTTP/1.0\r\n
    ...
    Authorization: External-KerberosIV\r\n
    \r\n
    [kerberos bits]
server:
    [kerberos bits]
client:
    [kerberos bits]
server:
    HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
    ...
    Content-type: text/html
    \r\n
    <HEAD>...</HEAD><BODY>...</BODY>

Example of IN-BAND Authentication
=================================
client:
    GET /document HTTP/1.0\r\n
    ...
    Authorization: PK-reverse key="987f98e987a987b987c98"
    \r\n

OK, we're getting a lot of crap (some of it outright hostile) about
the "quality" of the 2.0 prereleases, DESPITE the huge disclaimers
that we issue when we do the prereleases.  If this continues, we will
stop doing prereleases.

To reiterate: IF YOU WANT STABILITY, get 1.2.  IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH NEW FUNCTIONALITY AND ARE WILLING TO DO SO WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR,
have fun with the prereleases; otherwise, DON'T.

Thank you and have a pleasant day,
Marc

It is an unstable prerelease.  There are no configuration options.
Everything is hardwired in libwww-2.09a/HTInit.c.  The real 2.0 will
have configuration options.

		Western WorldWideWeb Weaver's Waggle (W^6)
	(Software Interest Group on Distributed Information Systems)

  The UCSF Center for Knowledge Management will be hosting the first
in a series of monthly meetings focusing on the development of the
WorldWideWeb and other distributed information systems such as Gopher and
WAIS.  This event is open to Web enthusiasts of all persuasions; we hope
to cultivate a sophisticated community of users, authors, and developers.
If you are writing Web software or documents, or are just generally interested
in distributed information systems, please email www-sig@ckm.ucsf.edu to let
us know you'll be coming.
  This initial meeting will feature a talk on SGML given by Terry Allen,
Editor of O'Reilly & Associates Digital Media Group.  The rest of the time
will be devoted to being excited about the whole thing and perhaps getting
organized (deciding on future meeting dates, locations, and topics).

My definition of "crap" is not bug reports or constructive comments or
innocent questions -- as always, those are greatly appreciated.

My definition of "crap" is telling us that the "poor quality" of a
prerelease "reflects badly" on us, or that a particular prerelease is
a "step backwards", or that "this is so broken, I can't give this to
my users in such poor condition" -- when we've covered the prerelease
notice with disclaimers, etc. etc. etc.

Thanks again,
Marc

can someone explain to me *how* to use them, and what rel & rev can do
for me? The documentation at cern is very vague. Is it supported in
browsers like Xmosaic?

Subject: indexing html files and the old filter options to WAIS

A while back I seem to remember a thread concerning WAIS indexing html files.
If I'm not mistaken about the thread, did anyone come up with a way to 
index HTML without having tags in the database as well? What I'd like to 
end up with is an html file with a text section that is indexed but that
also contains links to images. Has anyone already done this?

   I quote a previous message in this mailing list
   by Marc VanHeyningen with whom I agree about this:

   An appropriate interoperation standard for Kerberos (certainly KRB-4,
   probably also KRB-5) and HTTP should be created.  However, by itself,
   Kerberos does not seem sufficient to meet the security needs of HTTP
   over a large and growing network.  Adding Kerberos to a site not

Marc is partially correct here.  There is a common confusion about
Kerberos that arises from the fact that Kerberos *only* authenticates.
It does not control access to data. (I'm *not* accusing anyone in
particular of being confused, merely pointing out that I've
encountered confusion before ;-)

Authentication is the establishment of the identity of interacting
parties. This is what Kerberos does.  Once an identity has been
established, one can ascertain that party's access rights to specific
data (authorization). The security of data is only as good as the
authentication of the parties involved.

   over a large and growing network.  Adding Kerberos to a site not
   already so equipped is nontrivial; Kerberos needs central servers and
   probably could not scale to a system with 100,000 different
   administrative realms and 10,000,000 users.

It would indeed be silly to have 100,000 administrative realms.  EINet
provides authentication services (ie, administers kerberos realms) so
that others need not do so. As to scaling, there are several ways to
scale Kerberos into the 10's of millions. We provide additional
software for access control using the authenticated Kerberos
identities. We have integrated this authentication/access-control
software with a number of client/ server applications like WAIS, ftp,
telnet, news, and soon, WWW.

In regards to the proposed "basic" scheme, I certainly wouldn't protect
important documents that way. Authentication by public key is
fine, but the infrastructure necessary for wide-spread use of such
a system is not yet in place. EINet will eventually support this form
of authentication, as well.

   > If the server *does* support this form of authentication, it returns a
   > "please continue" status, and *holds the connection*. The client and

   No! The no-sessions and no-state requirements have been there from the
   start and are well justified.  If a stand-alone server holds the
   connection it *will* slow things down considerably by reserving the
   server from taking the next request.

Hmmm, our server forks...  In any case, I suggested this way of doing
things precisely because of performance.  Let me explain.

As the Kerberos mutual-authentication protocol stands now (v4 at
least), an HTTP client cannot blithly send a GET message with a
Kerberos authentication field and then proceed to authenticate on the
connected socket. If the server doesn't grok Kerberos, the data
exchange will be bungled.  That means the client has to know
beforehand whether the server can authenticate with Kerberos protocol.
How does the client find this out?

Well, the client can make a request without the authentication field
and the server will tell it which schemes it supports. So, the client
re-submits the request with authentication field, they do the Kerberos
two-step together, and the server sends back the data (or not).
Doing this for every document retrieval seems pretty inefficient, so 
I proposed a negotiation phase in the retrieval protocol.

I like Tony Sanders's proposal, although it still requires the client
to ask or know beforehand whether a server uses Kerberos. I would
modify it slightly, since there aren't really as many exchanges of
Kerberos bits as he shows.
 
client:
    GET /document HTTP/1.0\r\n
    \r\n
server:
    HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
    Authenticate: External-KerberosIV, realm="bsdi.com",priciple="foo"
    Authenticate: PK-reverse, principle="joe's-computers"
    Authenticate: basic; kerberos

Example of OUT-OF-BAND Authentication
=====================================

client:
    GET /document HTTP/1.0\r\n
    ...
    Authorization: External-KerberosIV\r\n
    \r\n
    [kerberos bits]
server:
    [kerberos bits]
    HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
    ...
    Content-type: text/html
    \r\n
    <HEAD>...</HEAD><BODY>...</BODY>

Example of IN-BAND Authentication
=================================

    GET /document HTTP/1.0\r\n
    ...
    Authorization: PK-reverse key="987f98e987a987b987c98"

I recently modified iubio-wais-8b5 so it parses HTML files, and I'm
using it to index some poetry files we have online.  You can tell it
to ignore HTML tags, but if you want to index certain sections you
have to teach the parsing functions about the structure of your
documents (sorry!)

If you'd like to see my changes I can make them available for you.

*****	Should webs have many "leaf" documents?

I se nothing wrong with such a web.  Personally, when WRITING
I feel the urge to put cross-references in to reduce
duplication, and help people find things and look at it in their
own way.  I feel it makes my documents more valuable.
This is my style. And my time taken to make the links.

This does NOT mean that databases with a pure hierarchy
and no cross-links are "bad".  Not at all.
Most documents I image and will be for a long
time non-hypertext and the web is very useful as
a place to put and find them.  They are
not second-class citizens.  (Not necessarily
anyway!)

*****   Should documents be different as a function
	of circumstances?
	
My view is as follows.  When a document header in HTTP
specifies the URL/N (URI) of a document, then it does it
in one of two ways: as a
	
	Live-URI:
	
which means that it does NOT guarantee that the document
will be the same, nd

	Version-URI:
	
which DOES.  When you are quoted a URI then you don't know
which sort you have untill you have retrieved it and got the
headers.

This is my answer also to Larry's point about mutable objects.

   Hello to all,

If you find this message too long for you, at least read the last
two paragraphs!

> In regards to the proposed "basic" scheme, I certainly wouldn't protect
> important documents that way.

I wouldn't either, if they were that important.  However, something
is not quite clear to me.  When discussing the protection of documents
it seems that authentication is more important than protecting the
contents of the documents. If someone can listen to the ethernet and
catch my cleartext password and use it to access protected documents,
then what prevents him from catching the cleartext documents flying by
even if I use Kerberos to authenticate myself. Ethernet-listeners just
have to eavesdrop long enough and the chances are they may get the
entire protected documentation this way.

I may have misunderstood something, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think encrypting documents is exactly as important as encrypting
authentication information, and there should be no talk about using
non-cleartext authentication with cleartext server replies. Currently
it is more vital to protect the documents than to verify integrity and
sender authenticity (sure we can do that too, and it will be a side
product of putting encryption in).

Lets consider both PEM and WWW, without using encryption in the message
body. When composing a PEM message I as the sender authenticate myself
to the recipient, and provide means for checking my message integrity.
When the recipient gets my message he can be sure of two things:
the message is from me, and the message was not tampered by a third
party during transfer. He cannot be sure that no one else has seen it.
In WWW it is much more a problem that secret documents get exposed,
rather than forged, during transfer.

There is no more infrastructure needed for using public keys than using,
say Kerberos, as long as the servers don't have to authenticate
themselves to the clients. There is only one public key needed, and
that is the server's. It does not have to be distributed in some
special way, it is simply transferred to the client in the server reply.

This is what happens with all the protection schemes: the client
cannot know beforehand what protection scheme the server supports/
requires. However, not every request has to be made twice: once a
request has failed the browser then knows that this server is using,
for instance, Kerberos.

The way I had specified the browser algorithm for resolving whether
a document is protected by a given protected server has been
described as "highly heuristic and bound to fail". I was very upset
and I still disagree. Funny, that the same person suggested a
probably more heuristic approach, which was also more unsecure,
harder to maintain, and certainly stranger to common sense and
therefore harder to understand by regular people, -- not everyone
is an internet-freak like we are, certaily not all the information
providers who would have to maintain protected Webs.

Especially, what is bothering me is that the people (here at CERN)
who requested the Access Authorization and need it badly and quickly
do not want a complicated cryptic hard-to-maintain system. They
don't want to put their files in directories named after random numbers.
They don't understand why their file "SecretOverview.html" is not
that but "362SecretOverview.html" because there has to be some hash
number in front of the filename.

[This may sound strange to you, because I refer to a discussion
that we had here at CERN: it was about protecting docs by making
URLs themselves the access tickets for documents -- well its a nice
idea, and these crazy ideas can be made up for many everyday things,
but they don't always prove practical in real use however nice they
look.]

A short review of my proposal:

	Protected documents are gathered into directories of
	protected docs. Because it is defined that URLs
	indicate directory-like structure, and extremely
	seldom this structure is different from the real
	directory structure in which the documents are stored,
	I can use this in my favour.

	If the browser fails to access a doc /a/b/c because
	of lack of authentication, it figures out that
	every document in directory /a/b is protected, and
	always authenticates himself when accessing files
	in that directory.

	When accessing a protected document in some other
	directory, this fails again once, and then automatically
	sends authentication with subsequent requests.


I fail to see how this is inefficient -- in fact quite contrary: in
a long run this proves to be much more efficient than holding the
connection.

As for the claim about my proposal being "heuristic", I disagree
with this, too.  This statement was backed up by the fact that
the rule file can map individual files all around the directory
tree. Now I ask: how many such file-to-file mappings are there
except some directory names are mapped to corresponding Welcome
pages? And another question: if you have a set of protected files
do you *really* hash them all around the directory tree? That
would be like asking for someone to see a couple of them by
accident. At least I would collect all my protected stuff into
a clear hierarchy where they are easy to maintain and to keep an
eye on. Wouldn't you all agree?

Now, what most scares me is that WWW Access Authorization
becomes too cryptic for the end-user, and especially for
[protected] information providers. WWW is just making its way
to the top, and I would hate to see people commenting my access
authorization like many people now comment Kerberos: "Oh, I'm
sure its good, but it's too cryptic and I didn't even want to
look into it".

I *have* looked into it, so I know what it's like -- it's not
that cryptic, but because it appears that way to a casual
person looking at it, I believe that we have to be very careful
about  our Access Authorization. Never forget, this has to be
operated by people without the special knowledge and insight
that we might have about this.

I agree with this proposal and I'm willing to go along with it, but I
want to make one note: A server running a certain protection scheme
in my opinion *should not* accept anything else. For instance in this
example server is accepting both Kerberos authentication and "basic";
if the server requires the relatively high authenticity that Kerberos
provides, why is it that it should settle for less? This weakens the
system, and makes Kerberos in this example useless -- if an intruder
wants to get in, he gets in through the "basic" scheme, and Kerberos
cannot do anything about it.

Besides, running two parallel protection schemes on the same server
causes some major difficulties, am I not right?

Also I would like to remind, that on server side currently *not* so many
protocol tasks are done by the library as on client side, for example
the headers are parsed by the server and not by the library. Complicating
the protocol results in problems with each individual server implementaion,
and it's likely that this results in bugs in each server. What is more
is that these bugs are unique to each server -- they must be corrected
individually; waiting for new release of the library doesn't help, because
the bug is not in there (weeell, from what I've seen it seems likely that
there are some in there, too... ;-)).

Anyway, this proposal (I mean the "Authenticate:" field) is not such a big
change, but I just wanted to say this anyway.

PS. Would someone with more verbal talent and vivid imagination come up
    with better names for my schemes than "basic" and "pubkey". Otherwise
    they might end up with spooky names like
    "Dame-Edna's-Purple-Possume-Protection", of DEPPP for short (Hmmm...
    too much Coke today... ;-)), or even worse, remain with the depressing
    names that they currently have.

Think ATM cards (money machine cards, whatever).  Users don't want to
have to get an account with each bank.  They want *one* account with the
bank of their choice and they want that ATM card to work everywhere.  While
in pratice that isn't always the case it's pretty close, maybe we can
do better?

We have a small complication that you need a bank card with a high
enough level of security but a user with a kerberos account shouldn't
*also* need a "basic" account should they?

[anyway the example, was just an example]

This is a piece of cake for Plexus.  No point in requiring full encryption
of a free-by-subscription service just because you have other sensitive
data on the same server, and running multiple servers shouldn't have to be
your only option because the protocol is lacking.

Presumably this is for the case where only "basic" is required, but the
server is willing to accept additional *higher-security* protocols as
well.

Hi, Ari.

luotonen@ptsun00.cern.ch (Ari Luotonen) sez:

   > In regards to the proposed "basic" scheme, I certainly wouldn't protect
   > important documents that way.

   I wouldn't either, if they were that important.  However, something
   is not quite clear to me.  When discussing the protection of documents
   it seems that authentication is more important than protecting the
   contents of the documents. If someone can listen to the ethernet and
   catch my cleartext password and use it to access protected documents,
   then what prevents him from catching the cleartext documents flying by
   even if I use Kerberos to authenticate myself. Ethernet-listeners just
   have to eavesdrop long enough and the chances are they may get the
   entire protected documentation this way.

   I may have misunderstood something, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
   but I think encrypting documents is exactly as important as encrypting
   authentication information, and there should be no talk about using
   non-cleartext authentication with cleartext server replies. Currently

Yes, you're exactly right.  I didn't bring up encryption since my
reply was already very long.  A Kerberos-authenticated connnection
also has an associated session key which is unique to the connection,
and known only to the two connected (software) parties. This session
key can be used to encrypt the data stream using any fast, symetric
algorithm such as DES.  As you point out, it *is* important to protect
the data in a fashion proportial to the authentication of the receiver.

   > Authentication by public key is
   > fine, but the infrastructure necessary for wide-spread use of such

   There is no more infrastructure needed for using public keys than using,
   say Kerberos, as long as the servers don't have to authenticate
   themselves to the clients. There is only one public key needed, and
   that is the server's. It does not have to be distributed in some
   special way, it is simply transferred to the client in the server reply.

The server must have the public key of the client in order to
authenticate the client. The authentication process in this case is
the successful decryption of the clients private-key message with the
client's (ostensible) public key.  The infrastructures I refer to are
the publishing and certification mechanisms and (human) organizations
associated with the distribution of the client's public key.  This
infrastructure is of comparable order to a Kerberos infrastructure,
and simply has a different set of associated problems than those of
Kerberos.  I suppose a choice is best made based on which set of
problems you prefer to live with ;-).

As to authenticating the server to the client, the server itself
cannot provide the server's public key in the message - the public key
must be provided to the client by a trusted third party (certified) in
order to have validity. Server authentication is only really important
when the information a client is retrieving may significantly
influence the client's commercial or financial actions.

Now, about access control. I agree that it's important to have a
simple mechanism that a wide variety of people can use. However, I
think it's important to keep in mind that authentication is a somewhat
separate issue from authorization. 

For example, HTTP (the protocol) needs to support a variety of
authentication mechanisms, but the authorization process need not
involve the protocol definition at all. Once an identity has been
authenticated, any number of algorithms for authorizing access based
on that identity can be used. These might vary from a simple file with
a list of identities and directories, to an comprehensive access
control server like the one EINet provides to its customers.  

In the EINet scenario, our customers don't have to support the Kerberos
infrastructure (we do that for them), but they do have to maintain
their authorization database if they want to protect their data.

As you point out, some people only need a "little" control, and have to
support both the authentication database (id/password?) as well as
the authorization database (object/id/rights association). In these
cases, they accept "weak" access control for simplified support.

On the other hand, EINet customers and commercial publishers need
stronger authentication and protection. They can afford the added
complication and cost. The Web should be able to support this entire
range of users.

Hi.  As I understand it the output of the Unix command line
client
	www -source "url"
is supposed to be in HTML format.  To my surprise the
output of
	www -source "gopher://gopher.domain.org"
is just ASCII, with no formatting and no URL links to other
gopher sites.

Getting this straight would let the "webmail" servers
do navigation into gopherspace, which should prove useful
for people building mixed systems.

  I've just joined this list, and it looks like it could be a good
  place to start; I'd like to be able to run X/Mosaic (current version
  1.2) over a firewall to the Real Net. At the moment, we've got a 
  proxy TCP/IP and FTP server set up on a machine on the other side,
  so actually getting the packets out and in isn't too much of a problem.

  My question is: has anyone successfully done this before? If so,
  can you offer any hints? Tips? Pointers? Dereferences? 

  If you're just going to say: "It can't be done", then I'd rather not
  hear; at least that way, I don't know that anyone thinks its 
  impossible; I might even get it to work.

    TIA,

The socks package was supposed to support a proxy XMosaic server (see
attached message, below). A quick look at the ftp location mentioned
below shows a 
<A HREF="file://ftp.inoc.dl.nec.com:pub/security/socks.cstc.4.0.tar.gz">newer version</a>, 
dated August 10th, maybe it will do what you want?

Sounds right to me.  It's nice that "www -source" simply returns
whatever the server on the far end sent.  If you then want to mark up
non-HTML things to be HTML on the client side in your app, that would be
OK too.  But please don't convert ftp://foo.org.domain/pub/dir/foo.tar.Z
to HTML for me, thanks.

Subject: Revised Access Authorization Spec
Status: RO



I appreciate all the comments -- both positive and negative -- about
the AA documentation that I have received -- both publicly in this
list and privately.

This is my second [still unofficial and subject to change] proposal,
listing proposed changes to my first proposal. Some changes are
directly as requested by other people, some are modified by me, and
some are modifications made by me without a request, because I myself
have found something wrong somewhere.


 * Authentication and access authorization are two different steps,
   and giving the reply is a third step (the original Access
   Authorization is therefore split into three parts).

 * As a result of authentication process server gets the following
   information:
	- did authentication succeed or fail
	- who is the authenticated user
	- secret encryption key shared by both client and server
	  and unknown to everyone else

 * Authentication can be done by two authentication schemes
   implemented as part of the common library (basic-authenction,
   pubkey-authentication), or by other schemes (Kerberos, etc)
   for which support is added by instances other than CERN,
   CERN only providing a clear interface for external authentication
   services (which is also used internally by the two internal
   authentication schemes).

 * Access authorization takes place if authentication succeeds.
   Authentication routine returns (among other things) the username
   which is used in access authorization. Access authorization part of
   the proposal has not changed, except for two things:

	- Access Control List contains triples (not tuples):

		template : method,method,... : group,user,group,...

	- the existance of ACL *alone* results in access authorization
	  being turned on
	===>
	- therefore rule files do not have to have any "protect" rules
	  and AA may still be on
	- so, protection is off *only* when there is no ACL *and* no
	  "protect" rule
	- therefore it is a "directive" telling that something is
	  protected even if there is no ACL (because someone forgot to
	  put it there)

 * authorization check procedure is always the same -- in fact, there
   only exists one access authorization procedure

 * the reply from server in "basic" scheme does not differ in any way
   from a reply from a public server (i.e. when the document is sent)

 * the reply from server in "pubkey" scheme is either encrypted or the
   same as in basic scheme

 * the form of reply is really controlled by a protection scheme (this
   is a term -- or I partly used this as a synonym for Access
   Authorization Scheme; now the term "AA Scheme" has been buried to
   the mighty catacombs of my personal dead ideas, and there only
   exist "authentication schemes" and [document] "protection schemes")

 * all the requests and replies may contain Message Integrity Checks
   (MICs)

 * The status line is no longer used to indicate the scheme that the
   server uses; if there is the 401 [Unauthorized] status code, there
   are "Authenticate:" fields indicating the valid schemes:

	Authenticate: scheme scheme-specifics

   For current schmes these are:

	Authenticate: basic
	Authenticate: pubkey server's_public_key

 * Server id is given in Server-Id: field.

 * There may (but does not have to) be a "Protection-Template:" field
   giving a template for URLs that are all protected (this lessens the
   so-called "heuristicity" of my proposal -- however, the library
   will contain this heuristic stuff because it has already proven
   powerful (and I can give a good reasoning why, too, if someone
   disagrees), and lacking this field does not result in any
   complications).

 * A given server supports a fixed set of authentication schemes, i.e.
   this set may not vary according to which ducument is being
   accessed. Otherwise this would complicate either rule or ACL file.

 * Because of the separation of authentication and authorization, the
   server does not have to announce which authorization scheme it
   uses, because there is only one. The reply may, however, be
   encrypted or not depending on server setup -- this we call a
   *protection scheme*.

 * The used protection scheme is clearly indicated by the header
   fields in reply. There is currently no negotiation about the
   protection scheme -- it is dictated by the server. However,
   it is not ment that there are lots of protection schemes; rather
   there are hooks to provide the possibility of having multiple
   different protection schemes *if*so*should*happen*, that we need
   more than the Common Library will contain.

 * The protection schemes are: none, MIC only, encrypted by DES-CBC
   Every client implementation supporting AA must support DES-CBC, but
   needs not support anything else.

 * I request a discussion about which encryption algorithm to use, it
   is easy to M-x replace-string DES-CBC to something else.

 * A reply from a protected server starts with a status line:

	HTTP/1.0 202 Privacy enhanced reply follows

 * The header lines are never encrypted except for two individual
   fields:
	- DEK-Info identifying the body encryption algorithm and the
	  DEK (Data Encryption Key), and
	- header-MIC (header integrity check, should this be HIC ;-)).

   Reason for this is that the header lines contain so much material
   that is always the same that it compromises the encryption key.

 * DEK-Info field:
	- if it does not exist, reply is in cleartext
	- if it exists, reply is encrypted
	- there may not be more than one DEK-Info field
	- contents is a la RFC1421:
	  there are two arguments, separated by comma:

		DEK-Info: algorithm, encrypted_DEK

	  where algorithm is as described in RFC1423, currently only
	  DES-CBC will be implemented in the common library.


 * Therefore there is no need for a second status line.

 * In pubkey authentication scheme, the uuencoded and encrypted (by
   server's public key) authentication string is no longer:

	username:password:browser_key

   but is now:

	username:password:browser_inet_address:timestamp:browser_key

   Adding browser's internet address and timestamp reduces radically
   the possibility of replaying, and therefore encrypting the reply is
   no longer necessary in order to make re-playing useless.

   In theory, timestamp could expire within a few seconds. The real
   interval is to be specified, and depends on how strictly we require
   the clocks to be syncronized. If the timestamp has expired
   authentication fails.

   If the source address of authentication is different from that
   found in authentication string the authentication fails.

 * There may be message integrity checks (MICs) in both client request
   and server (success) reply. There are two different MICs: one for
   message body, and one for header lines (including status line).

   If there is one MIC, there is always the other, too.

   The reason for not having a single MIC is the need to cache
   encrypted documents.

 * When computing header-MIC, the body-MIC is included (but of course
   header-MIC not, because it doesn't exist yet).

 * Browser uses its secret key to encrypt request header-MIC.

 * Server uses its private key to encrypt the reply header-MIC
   (browser's secret key could be used as well, maybe that would be
   better???).  Body-MIC is not encrypted.

To add another variable - I think the results of running
"www -source ..." depend on the version of the www client you're
running, e.g. with a really old one we happened to have here...

I don't think this should be a general restriction.  Plexus will have
no problem doing this and configuration doesn't have to be unduly
complicated (e.g., you could simply put the config file in each top-level
directory instead of having a central one).

Why define a new code?  IMHO, all this information should be in headers,
not on the status line.  You even already defined headers for this, so
this is really just duplicate information.  Does it really serve any
purpose?

Oh, BTW, TimBL had suggested using WWW-foo: for the new headers we define
to avoid collisions.  Of course, any headers you are using from existing
specs or proposals are fine.

We appreciate all your work on this.

Is <margin> like /marginpar in Latex? I hope it is, I am missing
them. But marginpar's are presenteation stuff. What is the functional
equivalent?

I have used them in books for three functions: subheadings,
short summaries (of what is important in the
present paragraph) and anchors to help readers find the
exact places that are referred to from some other page.

The following are not suggestions of what should be done,
just first thoughts about how to tackle the stuff
(I do wish it tackled, I have some 300 pp. latex stuff full of
marginpars that i'd like to convert to html):

Subheading stuff could be just presentation (<h4> could be
a marginpar eg.).

Anchors could also be presentation (all anchor names presented as
marginpars), or maybe there could be a new parameter like <a name=xyz
why="explanation why this part is referred to from somewhere else">

Summaries could maybe also be parameters <p sum="....">.

Status: RO

The modest proposal is: use FTP.

a) add a new kind of URL:    FTPU://host/path
   this URL is like FTP: except that it assumes that the user will
supply a user name and password, i.e., not anonymous access

b) change your links in any document that points to anything that
requires protection to instead use FTPU://host/path links.
Of course, relative paths will still work, so you only have to change
the links to the entry points.

Well, yes, FTP is slower than HTTP, but by the time you do all this
authorization and stuff, maybe it isn't that much slower, and you can
cache FTP connections which have logged in, etc. Besides, web servers
already have FTP code in them, the only thing you have to do is keep
track of username/password pairs for specific hosts.

You're not inventing any new security scheme, so you're unlikely to
get into trouble, like gopher did, of compromising the security of a
site by introducing a new, incompatible security mechanism. FTP
already has access control, and separate access control for read and
write, so you don't have to build a new ACL mechanism.

Using cleartext passwords is not security, it's the illusion of
security.  There's very little authentication, no message integrity
checking, no disclosure protection, and no non-repudiation of origin.

That "only thing" is very hard to do, and won't scale.

Here I'll agree in principle; we should invent as little new stuff as
possible.  But there are other constraints; we should be consistent
with existing tendencies in the protocol, keep the protocol
request-response, and have something that will scale adequately.
(Something that can be used in the U.S. would also be nice.)

Subject: New version of the emacs WWW Browser
Cc: simpson@math.psu.edu
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.1a10>
Status: RO

Hello all,
   This is just to announce the release of yet another beta version of the 
emacs World Wide Web Browser.  This is version .993 (Beta), but seems to be 
pretty stable.

   One of the major additions to this version is support for forms.  I have 
added the same extensions to the <INPUT> tag as Xmosaic - namely the RESET 
and SUBMIT types.  No type checking is done right now, but should be fairly 
straightforward to add.  Major bug thoug - in emacs18, if you edit the 
fields more than once it sends each edit to the server - anybody want to 
write a delete-zone function? :>

   Other changes include:
        1) More HTML+ support, including support for the <EM> tag, and all 
its            roles, <REMOVED> and <ADDED> tags, <SP>, and <BR>
        2) Better MIME support
        3) An integrated gopher mode - converts gopher output into valid 
HTML            and parses it like any other buffer - preserves the 
hypertext            flavor, and allows you to use the same viewers while in 
           gopherspace.
        4) Various small changes to the parser - better <ADDRESS> handling,  
          etc.

   For those of you who don't know what the emacs browser is, it is a world 
wide web browser written entirely in emacs lisp.  It has support for 
mulitple fonts when in xwindows (epoch,emacs19, and lucid emacs), and 
graphics (epoch version only).  It is fully HTTP/1.0 compliant, and is on 
its way to being HTML+ savvy.

   The files can be found at ftp://cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/, the files are:

    w3.tar.z - the main browser files
extras.tar.z - support files that w3 uses (ange-ftp, gopher, and nntp)

   If you are just upgrading the browser (or already have the support files 
installed), you will only need the w3.tar.z file.

   If you pick up this package, please drop me a line and let me know so I 
can get a general idea of how many people are using it, and so I can let you 
know of alpha/beta releases.

   This should be coming out of beta release soon - it is getting very 
stable, and I am wrapping up the research project it is a part of, so I'd 
appreciate it if anyone who has the time try it out and let me know what 
breaks.  If possible, a working knowledge of emacs lisp is useful for 
sending in bug reports, but is not necessary (for bug reports, please 
include emacs version and the url of the document that broke it).

   The documentation is online at http://cs.indiana.edu:80/elisp/w3/docs.html

Thanks,
   Bill P.

how about <ftp://martin@genie.lut.ac.uk/whatever> ?

i think this is in the URL draft...

        Internet protocol parts


            Those schemes which refer to internet protocols have a
          common syntax for the rest of the object name. This starts
          with a double slash "//" to indicate its presence, and
          continues until the following slash "/".  Within that section
          are

                  . An optional user name, if this must be quoted to the
                    server, followed by  a commercial at sign "@".  (Use
                    of this field is discouraged. Provision  of encoding
                    a password after the user name, delimited by a
                    colon, could  be made but obviously is only useful
                    when the password is public, in  which case it
                    should not be necessary, so that is also
                    discouraged.)

        [...deleted...]

        FTP

            The ftp: prefix indicates a file which is to be picked up
          from the file system of the given host. The FTP protocol is
          used. The port number if given gives the port of the FTP
          server if not the FTP default. (A client may in practice use
          local file access to retrieve objects which are available
          though more efficient means such as local file open or NFS
          mounting, where this is available and equivalent)

            The syntax allows for the inclusion of a user name and even
          a password for those systems which do not use the anonymous
          FTP convention. The default, however, if no user or password
          is supplied, will be to use that convention, viz. that the
          user name is "anonymous" and the password the user's mail
          address.

...!

I have a quibble though - the BNF for "fileaddress" doesn't include
the user name / password component, or an optional port number:

            fileaddress    f t p : / / host / path
            hostport        host [ : port ]
            host           hostname | hostnumber

Could we get something more along the lines of the telnet entry
into it please?  ...

            fileaddress    f t p : / / [ user @ ] hostport / path

Tim, are you listening?? :-))

I've heard, that the epoch and the lucid emacs will be merged and that a lot
of the work is done in the current release 19.8. Has anyone tested if the

Folks,

Just my two pence worth.

I havn't followed the discussion in great detail and I know nothing about 
the issues of authorization.  However, I know I would definitely feel better 
about any solution that used schemes (like Kerberos) that were already in 
(wide) use.  The advantages should be obvious.

On that theme, has any consideration been given to several RFC's that were 
recently posted relating to distributed security/authentication:

RFC 1507 - Distributed Authentication Security Service
RFC 1508 - Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
RFC 1509 - Generic Security Service API : C-bindings

(RFC 1510 is for Kerberos v5).

I havn't read them - no time.  I just thought they might be useful.

Steve.

Is Kerberos really in wide use?  If so, where?  (I have no idea...)

> The modest proposal is: use FTP.

I know that all these half-eyed one-legged ;-) proposals are made
due to the fact that the so-called "basic" scheme doesn't provide
with much real security. The whole idea is that it will be compatible
with the next step, "pubkey" which provides almost the same security
level as PEM. It would be a needless mess to eventually end up with
two completely different schemes. And I'm not talking about far future,
if there aren't any enormous complications [with you guys ;-)], I would
finish this level by the end of this year.


By the way -- I reread the RFC1421 last night, and noticed that
I confused Key-Info: and DEK-Info: fields in my Revised Proposal. So
what I called DEC-Info is really Key-Info, like in my 1st proposal.

I also noticed that the body-MIC has to be encrypted, too. And it
should be encrypted first by server's private key (useful if we later
add server authentication) *and* then with browser's key (security).

Now I'm not sure if it's necessary at all to have the header MIC,
comments?

This RFC defines how to fit Kerberos and such authentication into
the telnet framework. This is unusable because telnet negotiation
is built on the fact that there is a session -- in HTTP we try to
avoid that. Besides, there is really very little anything new in my
proposal, most of it conforms with RFC1421, Privacy Enhanced Mail.
It is only dressed up in terms of HTTP. And because we can do it
without a session, then why fight agaist it so hard?

Kerberos V4 is certainly in wide use in lots of places, even here.
Kerberos V5, however, is needed to be even marginally tolerable for
WWW applications (V4 requires n^2 secret keys where n is the number of
administrative domains, and is thus not scalable.)  Kerberos in
general is, IMHO, not sufficiently scalable for WWW purposes for
reasons I think I've blathered about before enough.

Evening Marc,

Have a heart.  It's early over here - early enough for a couple of 
unsubstantiated comments.  You're right, of course.  I didn't mean to 
imply by the braces that (wide) applied to (Kerberos).  I should have 
been more specific.  Maybe you could tell me how widely its used :-).  

It's just the cumulative impression I got from a newsgroup, the fact that its 
MIT software, it's been around a while, the number of platforms its available 
for, the fact that OSF DCE is based on it, its use by DEC and Transarc (who ??) 
.....

However if there is no solution out there (not necessarily Kerberos), then 
fine.

It's just I would not like to see the wheel reinvented `cos the first one 
was the wrong color.

Steve.

Top-level directory is not good (the same reason as before, links in file
system). But I have changed my opinion, I agree; how about changing
"protect" rule (because it has already become 90% redundant -- don't ask
me how I get these figures... ;-)):

	protect <template>
	protect <template> <authentication>
	protect <template> <authentication> <protection>

<authentication> is something like "basic", "pubkey", "Kerberos", etc.
<protection> is something like "NONE", "MIC-ONLY", "ENCRYPT".

And there would also be two additional fields in rule file:

	default_authentication <authentication>
	default_protection <protection>

Which are used if <authentication> and/or <protection> is not provided
in "protect" rule, or if there is no "protect" but there is an existing
ALC file.

Well now that I think about it, it doesn't serve any purpose. Ok, it's

Ok, so they will be:

Both:
	WWW-Body-MIC:		These could be only one MIC-Info: with
	WWW-Header-MIC:		multiple subfields. How about it?

Request:
	Authorization:		This is already in use, and was in HTTP spec
				when I started on this, so no "WWW-".
Reply:
	WWW-Authenticate:
	WWW-Protection-Template:
	Key-Info:		These
	DEK-Info:		two are like in PEM.

I am currently discussing the technical details of how to do this with
Ari Luotonen at CERN. Currently I have a simple tcp/ip relay for just this
purpose which works with our own browser. We want to be able to switch to
X Mosaic and the CERN WWW Library - to avoid the maintenance hassles of
supporting our own browser.

Our relay program relies on telnet-level authorisation, but will also
check on the client's IP address to avoid the need for supplying a user
name and password for local users. I want to place this program into
the public domain as part of the CERN WWW library package. Browsers that
support Ari's authentication feature will then automatically support the
open subnet relay with out the need for further code changes.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett,

   Nope, no graphics merge yet.  Although from the discussion during the 
beta test of 19.8 it doesn't sound like it will be too far off (like 19.9 or 
19.10)

   A few problems with the release I sent out...

1) Deleting/adding hotlist items doesn't update the menubar in emacs19.  I'm 
   working on this, and hope to have it done today, but the emacs19    
implementation of menus as keymaps is odd to work with.

2) Links within headers don't work in emacs18.  Should be easy enough to 
fix,    just need to muck with how I store the information for the zones.

3) One or two formatting problems

4) Problem with viewers (non-MIME?)- trying to do a car on a string 
somewhere    - should be easy to track down with the debugger.

   I plan on working on these today, and hopefully getting them done before 
I leave town for the weekend.

   Just so you know these bugs have been reported and are being worked on. :)

Thanks for all the bug reports,
        Bill P.

Hoi folks!

I got a note from TimBL some time ago on the same issue.
The CERN httpd supports gatewaying ...

We have a a httpd running on a firewall machine.
To use it as a gateway do something like:

-----------------
#!/bin/sh

WWW_http_GATEWAY=//firewall.foo.bar:80
WWW_gopher_GATEWAY=//firewall.foo.bar:80

export WWW_http_GATEWAY WWW_gopher_GATEWAY

xmosaic $*
-----------------

However I had some (known) problems with binary data not beeing
gated correctly.

I am currently working on a modification to the NCSA httpd, which
should enable this server to work as a gateway for http and gopher
requests, too.

Ciao

Except that if you give me this URL, I get logged in as martin
(assuming I know your password).  The FTPU scheme says "log in as
yourself".  So you could have data readable by both martin and
eostrom, and point to it with the URL
    <FTPU://genie.lut.ac.uk/whatever>
and both you and I could get at it without my having to know your
password or vice versa.

Sure, point taken.  I was really thinking about the case where
you want to share ftp "accounts" - e.g. a guest ftp group in the
wuarchive ftpd.  Sorry my brain's very frazzled today :-)

fyi-- Another vote: we're using Kerberos at Columbia (v4).
(I don't think it's a big deal to patch a w3
server to accept an optional kerb ticket...)

Yes <margin> is like /marginpar in Latex. It functions as a summary or
attention getter for the paragraph to which it applies. You could also render
it as a pin icon which when clicked shows a pinned note at the same point
(Using the pin icon familiar to Sun users). Footnotes tend to function as an
additional comment on the paragraph and likewise could be rendered as a
pin-note.

Note that <margin> notes when shown in the left margin should be right
justified. You can also supply a hint with headers that they appear in the
left margin. In this case they should left justified: <h4 margin>. This
attribute is perhaps overkill, and probably belongs in the style sheet.

I would also like to find a new name for summaries that often precede and
follow the main header for an article, and frequently include the author's
name. These are typically shown in a bigger font than the body of the article
itself. <byline> doesn't have the right feel. Perhaps <subhead> ? What
do you think?

(this would be introduced along with <section> and <header> as supplements
to <h1> to <h6>).

I agree with you in general but...  it's good enough for a lot of
applications.  For example, you already run Kerberos so you could provide
local secure services without any additional work.  We run kerberos here
and could use it as the basis for a distributed source code control system
or something.

So while it's not useful for authenticating people far away, it's great
for providing local services (esp if you are already running kerberos).

When we have something better (which I don't think we do yet, though I'm
hopeful that something will come along soon) then we can go with it.
Until then there are a fair number of applications for kerberos.

Hi Marc and all,

Let me just point out what we are trying to do:
In a large collaboration for high-energy physics, there are many  
servers. All people in the collaboration want access to the  
collaboration-private data, they want to use a simple password  
scheme, they want to give their password only once per www session  
and they do not want to have accounts on all those machines. So we  
want what Ari is trying to do.

We want a lock on the door, or, as one British lock company allegedly  
once advertised: "our locks keep honest people out", in other words,   
the lock tells you: if you break in here, you are trespassing and you  
are not playing the game, but we cannot guarantee that really  
dishonest people will steal by what ever means. Let me also say that  
you have to trust the system administrators etc...

Now, if I were a banking institution, I would keep the handling of my  
customer's money transactions miles away from the Internet and Unix  
anyway.

So that is what I want Ari to do: provide a lock that is easy to use  
and does not cause headaches to the system administrators. We will  
probably have to duplicate the password files on all servers in a  
collaboration (unless we introduce a third machine in the exchange),  
and we will not use Unix schemes (because they do not apply on  
non-Unix platforms).

Kerberos etc. will eventuially come and maybe even scale to include  
all of humanity.
I think that the way things are designed is open enough for different  
schemes and higher security later on.

In the example you give, the username for FTP is part of the URL.
Maybe you could just extend <ftp://@genie.lut.ac.uk/whatever> to mean
'prompt for user name' instead of 'use the empty user name', and not
have to invent a new kind of URL.

If you just want to keep honest people out, then don't hack up the
protocol just to do it -- it isn't necessary. All you need is to put
the web under some directory /secret/ and add a 'query' page where you
have to type in 'secret' in order to get access to those files.

Actually, what is probably more effective and simpler is to add a
<H1>PRIVATE: This information is for use of members of the FOO project
Only. All other use is unauthorized.</H1>.

I bet you could fix up a server to just add the header automatically
to any files that were in a given directory.

Now please, let's not get out of line. This is once again a reference to
"passwords don't offer any security". But the *do*. I mean if there is
any kind of password protection, you have to *know* or find out the password
to get in. If there is just some notice, you don't have to know anything,
just go ahead.

It is said how easy it is to eavesdrop ethernet and find out about peoples
passwords. But normal people don't listen to ethernet. Going through so
much trouble as to catch http packets shows such a strong urge to get into
a system that very few really do it.

You are referring to the fact that is possible to break the protection, and
then you assume that every damn soul uses that possibility.
Its like throwing away a million bucks because you lost a dollar.
Do you think that a casual wanderer in the Web really even cares to look at
how WWW protection is implemented. He probably wouldn't even find the
documentation.

So this stops 99.9% of intruders, I am sure. Is that not better than a
braindead "This is secret" method -- I mean please! Who believes that? No
one would take it seriously -- nobody in his right mind would protect
anything just by saying this is secret. When there is a password at least
they know that this is secret enough that it is protected by a password.
This is clearly psychological.

For example: how do some hackers in Zimbabwe listen to CERN ethernet?
Tell me, what are the chances that they really find out somebody's password
in some of our collaborations?

Subject: URL ambiguity
Status: RO

The following URL illustrates a problem with some Web servers and clients.

        http://www.uth.tmc.edu/newton_info/

The directory "newton_info" contains a file called "index.html", which the
NCSA HTTP server looks for an serves back to the requesting client. So far
so good, but if the URL is changed to leave off the trailing slash

        http://www.uth.tmc.edu/newton_info

then the server will still return the "index.html" document, but now the
WWW client will think the path is "http://www.uth.tmc.edu/" not
"http://www.uth.tmc.edu/newton_info/". So, when a relative reference is
made from within the "index.html" document, something like <img
src="blah.gif">, the client will request "http://www.uth.tmc.edu/blah.gif"
instead of "http://www.uth.tmc.edu/newton_info/blah.gif" and the document
won't be found.

So a few questions come to mind. Do other servers have this same problem?
Should servers always require an explicit URL and not allow default
behavior such as displaying the file "index.html"? Should the URL syntax
require a "/" at the end of a directory name?

Certainly not.  An HTTP path is not a file system path.  The server
should be free to do any interpretation it wants, provided that it
maintains the general URL constraints--mainly that "/" indicates
hierarchical structure in the ways outlined.  So this is not a
"default behavior", it is the way the server chooses to interpret the
empty file name.

>						     Should the URL syntax
> require a "/" at the end of a directory name?

I think the answer here is that HTTP has no notion of "transmitting a
directory".  So, yes, a directory name ends with a "/", but it's
always followed by a file name--even if the file name is the null
string.  In your example:

>         http://www.uth.tmc.edu/newton_info/

refers to a "file" with a very short name ("") in the "directory"
newton_info.  (File and directory are in quotation marks because,
again, they don't have to refer to filesystem elements--for example,
"newton_info" could be just the name of a gateway, for all I know.)
And

>         http://www.uth.tmc.edu/newton_info

refers to the file "newton_info" in the top-level directory.

(The server _could_ respond to the latter request with an
automatically generated menu, in which each of the links has an HREF
like "newton_info/foo"...  Of course, that becomes annoying if you're
trying to maintain an index.html page--automatic conversion of the
links there would be possible, but is not trivial.)

What this means is that you shouldn't be passing around a URL that
points to a directory and doesn't end with a slash (have an empty file
name).  IMO, if a server _gets_ such a URL, it should either convert
the links to point into the directory ("newton_info/foo") or refuse to
serve the URL; it shouldn't just return what it would return for
"newton_info/", as that will most likely be wrong.

   Kerberos V4 is certainly in wide use in lots of places, even here.
   Kerberos V5, however, is needed to be even marginally tolerable for
   WWW applications (V4 requires n^2 secret keys where n is the number of
   administrative domains, and is thus not scalable.)  Kerberos in
   general is, IMHO, not sufficiently scalable for WWW purposes for
   reasons I think I've blathered about before enough.

What I beleive Marc means here is that, for V4, if one has 100
Kerberos realms which inter-authenticate, then each realm must have 99
database entries, one for each of the other realms. V5 changes this so
that the inter-authentication relationships are hierarchical. For
reasons I'll get into later, I don't think the difference is that
important. Some experts feel that the V5 setup is *not* a good idea,
as it places more dependency links in the security chain. A weak link
in the chain places parties on either side at risk.

A "weak link" can be a realm which has shoddy procedures for obtaining
Kerberos identities, or poor security on the host computer where the
Kerberos database resides. For example, in a university setting, an
academic department might simply send a list of people to the
computing center via campus mail to obtain kerberos identities for
their students. It might be fairly easy for someone close to the
process to obtain an "extra" identity with which to illegally access
data.  

At the other end of the spectrum, EINet requires a sequence of events
and verifications to occur before an identity is issued and later,
activated. For example, a corporate user's identity must be vouched
for and counter-signed in writing by an appointed corporate contact.
The application and returned identity are sent by receipt mail or
bonded courier, and contractual instruments make the corporation
liable for damages tracable to a corporate identity. The EINet
Kerberos databases themselves are on secure (C2) computers on secure
sub-nets, within *very* secure facilities. The point here is that the
nature of a Kerberos-authenticated identity in the EINet realm may be
quite different from identities in other realms.

In order for EINet to inter-authenticate with another realm, we would
not only have to be satisfied as to the other realm's policies,
procedures and physical security measures, we would also require a
contractual relationship to protect EINet customers, as well as periodic,
bilateral inspections to insure compliance.

All this is leading to a point about the supposed need for an
authentication mechanism to scale to the entire Web user community. In
terms of inter-authenticating Kerberos realms, this is simply not
necessary. As to the notion of having hundreds or even thousands of
inter-authenticating realms, well, "that dog don't hunt" (as our
President might put it :-).  In most scenarios involving access
control, there are relatively limited audiences for secure
information. There are, in fact, natural limits to how large an
audience can be before the data can no longer be considered secure.
Just look at how good our government is at leaking information to the
press. The same effect is true in authentication - an identity is
meaningless if there are too many inter-authenticating realms. There's
just too many links in the chain.

I think actual scenarios of access control on a large scale would be
interesting to discuss. Perhaps the issues would clarify in a more
concrete context.

Cheers, and have a good weekend (er, um, well, by the time you
read this, I hope you *had* a good weekend :-).

First off, thanks to Anthony Baxter, Dave Raggett, and Markus Stumpf, who 
responded to my request.

It seems that there are a couple of solutions -- the SOCKS package
(available via FTP from ftp.inoc.dl.nec.com:/pub/security/socks.cstc.4.0.tar.gz
supplies an xmosaic client, modified from version 1.2. Dave 
is working on his own tcp relay for the browser, and Markus suggested I try
the CERN httpd (with a caveat that binary transfers don't necessarily work
properly.

However, I neglected to specify just how many firewalls I'd be going through.
Naturally enough, everyone assumed one. That's the norm, after all. 
In fact, I'd be running the browser through two connected firewalls
(arrgh) -- the socks package (with modifications) might do this, or socks
combined with tcprpm or other TCP/IP relay software might have done it.

Still, there's no need to worry: a friend is working on an
arbitrary-number-of-hops, SOCKS-compliant TCP relay package -- it's in
testing at the moment, and should be available Real Soon Now (tm).

Subject: suggestion for form/ismap handling
X-Md4-Signature: d373ea6c4ecef736a532d6f2c586a0a2
Status: RO

Suppose the following:

For ISMAP image maps inside a FORM, when a click occurs on the image
map, instead of a normal query ("...?x,y") being sent to the query
server, the form is packaged up and sent as if a normal form SUBMIT
button had been pushed *with additional data* from the image map: e.g.
"?x=12&y=33&whatever=something&more=somethingelse" where "whatever"
and "more" are normal input elements from the form and "x" and "y"
come from the image map click.

This would allow the components of a FORM (toggle buttons, etc.) to
serve as a freely customizable "control panel" for an image map -- the
user could set toggles to get, e.g., "4x magnification" or "8x
magnification", or "return Sun audio" or "return SGI audio", or
whatever [those are stupid examples, but I'm tired], then click on the
image map to have something sophisticated happen.  Think of how the
Expo terrain map works now, and how much smoother it could be if the
simulated toggle buttons were actual client-side toggle buttons.

Seems to me this opens up lots of possibilities for a very minor
change -- every document that uses FORM at all will have to be written
from scratch anyway, therefore every document that has an ISMAP image
map inside a FORM can take this into account, and no existing ISMAP
documents will break.

(In fact, had we realized what forms would be like back when we added
ISMAP, we would have done "x=12&y=13" rather than "12,13" but we
didn't, and there's no real reason to change it now, *except* for
this case -- image maps inside forms.)

Comments welcome...

Cheers,
Marc

In addition, some scheme must be invented to work with automatic indexers
and search facilities.  In my average Gopher session, I find more items
with Veronica than I find items by stepwise link following.  With the
advent of similar techniques for the W3, items will often be read
by users who have no idea what path was followed to get there.

I'm not sure if we should require a trailing slash, but the problem remains
  that the slash has to get in the client somehow before the client requests 
  a relative file. 

One solution is to use the protocol's 300 directives to redirect the client
  to the version with a slash on the end. However, this requires a client
  who pays attention to them in order to be seamless, if not, then the user
  will get a message saying "This document has moved here" where the here
  is a link to the directory with a / appended. Current versions of Mosaic do 
  not support the 300 directives, but Marc just put it in so future ones will. 
  HTTPD 1.0a2 (you haven't seen it yet) supports returning 300 directives, 
  perhaps I will also modify the indexing code if it seems worthwhile to
  everyone else.

Thoughts?

I don't know whether anyone saw this message or not because the
cern machine appears to be rejecting all of my messages.  (maybe
someone is trying to send me a hint)

RESENT MESSAGE FOLLOWS:

I have converted the latest version of Hytelnet (6.5) to HTML and
made it available to the world!  This version is different than the
version served at Cern because it was translated using a slightly 
different translater (lynx2html).  I have also changed a few of the
files to look (IMHO) better.  The files are all pre-converted to
HTML so they should be served extremely fast.  I can also make the
database available via ftp in a tar file if others want it.

The entry point for the Hytelnet database residing in Kansas is:

http://www.cc.ukans.edu/hytelnet_html/START.TXT.html

I will, of course, attempt to keep this as up to date as possible.
Feel free to respond with complaints or comments. :)

happy hacking,

NIC Fest '93

The Workshop for Network Information Center Staff

InterNIC Information Services announces NIC Fest '93 to be held on
Saturday, November 6, 1993 in San Diego, California.  Join us for a
day-long workshop specifically designed for network information center
(NIC) management, staff, and anyone responsible for supporting
Internet users. In addition to a day full of useful information and
interaction, you'll receive a free copy of the first issue of NICLink, a
CD-ROM based collection of Internet reference materials. (see below)

[stuff deleted]

* Upcoming Developments in Cyberspace. Future developments to watch
for, so you can plan ahead. 

A free copy of a special introductory issue of NICLink will be distributed
to all NIC Fest attendees. NICLink, issued quarterly, is a CD-ROM
subscription service. The NICLink CD will contain the InfoSource, the
Information Services online information database that highlights the
information resources of the Internet.  Additional information, images,
electronic books, and software from the Internet will be included in
future issues.  The CD-ROM will be compatible with Macintosh, PC Windows,
and some UNIX configurations.  The software used to present the data is
Interleaf's WorldView Press, which incorporates full database search
functions as well as hypertext linking capabilities to provide a powerful,
easy-to-use interface.

	I agree.  In WWW, the link type is the place for this
	information.  The WWW worskshop decided to define
	a WWW-Link: message field for expressing these
	relationships in HTTP for any object, semantically
	equivalent the <LINK> tag in an HTML document, with
	parameters including relationship and URI of other object.


>This requires that each "information object" be given a  
characterization by
>a "responsible party" as to what variance it is intended to cover.


	Yes.  I saw the responsible party as being the URL
	issuer.


>That
>is, each of the above three examples in addition to having a unique
>identifying string would have auxiliary information saying what  
constitutes
>its "unique identity".

In the current HTTP spec, 


Live-URI: xxxxx
	
	means that the URI given may return different objects
	under the "update" transformation, and
	
Message-ID: xxxxx
	
	means that xxxxx is guaranteed to always dereference
	to the same version.
	
	The language and data format are specified in other
	fields ("Content-type" and "Language:") and one
	can in the request insist on a particular format
	or the original (Accept: "www/source").
	
	How could we generalize this futher?  Suppose for
	each type of variation we define (as we dicover them)
	fields such as
	
	Content-type:
	Language:
	Version:
	
	And then we merge Live-URI and Message-ID to make one
	URI: field with a parameter which lists the prperties
	which are invariant.  Or variant. Like
	
	   URI: xxxxx; fixed = language, content-type, version
	
	or
	
	   URI: yyyyy; vary=content-type
	
	What do you think?
	Is this sufficiently flexible?
	What should the default be?
	
	I am inclined to think that the safest is that the default
	is absolute identity, and that all variations must be
	specified.  This allows weird new transformations to be
	included, and old clients to at least know that something
	fishy is going on when they see
	
	   URI: zzzzz; vary=psychomorph
	   

	
>I am saying that it is up to the creator of an information object  
for which
>there will be a URN to specify just what constitutes a "variant"  
(meaining

from.

	Is the above what you intended?

	Precisely.

same one

	Exactly.

	Certainly.  Though we must define the "vocabulary"

	Yes. Here is an example of an object's meta information:
	
	 URI:  xxxxx
	 URI:  yyyyy vary = interpretation, langage, version, edition
	 WWW-Link: rel=describes; href=zzzzz
	 WWW-Link: rev=summarises; href=qqqqq
	
	The xxxxx refers to this particular bitstream. yyyyy
	refers to the works of Shakespeare in general, included
	illustrated annotated copies published by other
	people.  This document describes the 17th century world,
	identified by topic zzzzz.  There is a summary of the works
	of shakespeare identifiued by qqqqq.
	
	You have to access qqqqq to find out what sort of a mutable
	beast qqqqq referss to.
	
	What do you think, wizards?  Make HTTP take Terry's very good
	points into account in this way?

Kev,

I like the material!  I haven't set up the slide show
yet but the "Entering WWW - Guide to Cyberspace" is
a neat summary.  



One minor but important comment.  I don't think it
is true that the term "World-Wide Web" is or should
be `rapidly becoming synonymous with'
"The Internet".  A lot of people might object
to that, and it may cause some confusion.

I normally describe WWW as

o  Primarily the ideas, concepts and  initiaitive for
	global information as started at CERN;

o  The set of protocols which allow the idea to happen

o  The global body of information available using
   those protocols (HTTP, but also the older ones)
   

The "Web" is different from the "Net".  The "Web" is
a body of information, an abstract space of knowledge.
The Internet is a set of wires and routers.

	Web:Net    ::	Mind:Brain	:-)

When people explore the Internet they find hosts. When
they explore the Web, they find information and
abstract objects.

Tim

I know that one firm in Italy finally decided to whip up an Interleaf to
HTML filter, so at least someone is seeing the light.  We use Interleaf
here (on a limited basis, but Pratt and Whitney uses it exclusively), and
they'd kill for an ILeaf to HTML...unfortunately, this Italian company sold
the filter to Interleaf and they want sumthin like 15 grand for it!  I
think there may be a big business for the first person to create an RTF to
HTML, so that people don't need to learn Emacs, vi, or LaTex.

Sigh.  At least I have a Mac Hypercard HTML editor too bad its horrible.

Rick,
  There already is a very good rtf2html at ftp.cray.com which I think Chris
Hector (cjh@cray.com) wrote.  It works very well on MS Word documents.

There is a draft on NCSA, try anonymous ftp to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu and I
think it is in the /Web/misc directory.  If you have Mosaic up and running
there, you can simply get to it using the "Help" menu.

Another place to look would be to use Mosaic to connect to
hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  That is where NCSA tests and demos the newest HTML+
URL's.

Rick,
There already is a very good rtf2html at ftp.cray.com which I think Chris

These data points are a data model. Never mind the low-level  
implementation, my model is as follows --
I think it differs slightly from yours.

Objects may (as Terry says) be transformed in an open set of ways.
We need a vocabulary of these transformations.  A given URN or
URL (in fact lets just say URI) can refer, at the issuer's
 discretion,
to any subset of the products of such transformations.
Terry gave examples, something like URIs for "the works of
Shakespeare" and "A postscipt rendition of the Collins 1992
annotated hardback edition with images at 400dpi,
with Forward by Joe, in French".

When the URI is given on a document, the issuer may specify the
set of transformations which define the set of documents
accessable under that URI.  So (in english, to keep it "high
level"), the object may be give a URI "colour may vary"
or "price subject to fluctuation" or "available in several
languages".  In another case, [like for a mail message-id]
one gets "This URI refers only to this bit stream"

There is no "variant specifiers" in the URI.

That is too constraining.  A given IdAuthority might
issue URIs some of which are generic and some of which
are specific, and so may have many concepts of "same
in content" for different URIs.

I am trying to define this more rigorously.

> (d)  they may contain an optional *variant* specifier.

We are saying that it won't.  The URI is basically opaque, if
it has variant encoding that is part of the opque bit
_because_ if we formalise a structure for a variant description
then we have to formalise the variant transformations which as
Terry points out, we can't as they are too diverse.

> encoding or archive scheme, and (c) version number (1, 2, 3, etc.

You have a serial set of version numbers a la VMS.
Many versions are more complex. Supposing we require that
branches (a la CVS-RCS) are not modelled by the version number,
we still probably want a multi-level system as most people
go from 1.9 to 1.10, for example.  (I think these are basically
Ted Nelson's "tumblers")

This can be handled with more power by typed links.  A mechanism
built into the URI is in my opinion not powerful enough.  And
I _like_ the URI being a simple thing which when dereferences
produces an object -- with no other functionality.   That has a
simplicity upon which one can build.

Defining a URN distributed database should keep the URI group
occupied enough before trying to widen the scope.

Hi,

For support in linemode browsers (and possibly in the iconic images that marc
has added to the latest release of xmosaic ...Hi marc, you can perhaps use
it as a title:-) I want to use the ALT tag as suggested to me by Lou.

the ALT tag goes like
<img src="some_url" alt="some title"> 
The text "some title is displayed in place of the image on line mode browsers
instead of the default text [IMAGE]. ALT can be have the value "" in which case
nothing is printed.
This seems to me a very useful extension. I added it already to the first
page of the expo, and that gave great improvement of the line mode
view of the world.

However I see no such tag in the html+ definition (Mine may be old though)

can I use this tag, should I, will it be part of HTML+
(I'm hoping for three times yes here :-)

any comments are appreciated (you can leave them on the EXPO bulletin board
if you want to)

- frans

Kevin,

From a glance at the Guide it looks lovely.  But Tim's absolutely
right -- WWW is *not* the Internet, and such confusion should be
avoided, especially in an intro document.  In other quarters,
people think Usenet News *is* the Internet.  Others may think
Gopher *is* the Internet.  Others may have e-mail-only access to
the Internet -- what are they to believe, that they're not really
using the Internet?  In light of Tim's analogies, it's not the same
situation as xerox: photocopy; if anything, that doesn't give WWW
fair credit for its unique features.

	That's true - so, going along with some really good suggestions,
I've made some changes to the guide:

The appendices have been moved into separate files, so the guide can
be printed without them (and Appendix C was meant for local presentations
in Hawaii anyway). The sites described in Appendix B are now in Mosaic hotlist
form so you can use it to browse around. (Brings me to another question -
is the hotlist format the same for Windows and Mac Mosaic also?)

Using some of Tim's wording, I've changed the Web description, so hopefully
the difference between the Internet and the Web is a little more clear
and precise.

The appendices are at

http://pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu/guide/www.guide.app.a.html
http://pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu/guide/www.guide.app.b.html
http://pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu/guide/www.guide.app.c.html

The hotlist is at

http://pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu/guide/.demo.hotlist.txt

And just because I like it, a demo starting image (it's in color) is at

http://pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu/demo/demo.1.html

I'd like to be able to print a linear representation of a set of hypertext

A couple of weeks ago there was discussion (below) of the problems of documents
getting truncated when sending HTTP/1.0 requests to HTTP 0.9 servers.

Did anyone come to a clear understanding of these problems, and decide on a 
solution??

I would like to suggest that graphical browsers like Mosaic
consider implementing the IMG ALT attribute for possibly
use if the user chooses not to display graphics for performance
reasons.

I think the Internet != WWW problem arises from the fact that the
Internet *is* a world-wide web - it's an interconnected web of networks
covering the world. World-Wide Web (the proper name) describes the
information and protocols for our favourite hypertext system.
Similarly, USENET news is a net that people use for news. The problem
is that the proper name, out of context, can be misunderstood to be a generic term.

Gopher is a proper name, but a gopher is a small furry mammal, or a
colloquial term for the office dogsbody. It's well understood by
non-netters to be a proper name for a particular service, because it
doesn't have a computer related generic definition. This probably has
something to do with it's popularity.

As for "PC" - does that refer to any small system used personally by
one person (and hence including most U**x workstations), or just the
IBM compatibles? Again, the popularity of MS-DOS PCs may have some root
in the fact that many people mistakenly believe that the name for
particular architecture can be applied generically to everything.
Usually, this is not a problem with "Apple".

It would be useful if authors bore this in mind when writing
introductory guides. I think that many new users get so bombarded with
neologisms, that they just can't tell what is a proper name and what is
a generic term. Capitalisation is not much help, as many acronyms and
names have weird capitalisation (I remember a newspaper article a
couple of years ago bitterly complaining that PostScript was confusing
because the name had a capital S in the middle), and many people don't
pay enough attention to docs to appreciate the difference even if all
authors were rigorous about noting the difference. 

Just my 2 roubles worth.

Version 2.0 will feature an X resource for the option to have a small icon
displayed rather than having inlined images loaded.  Clicking on the icon would
subsequently load the image into the document.  Images which act as hyperlinks
would be appropriately marked.

I wonder if there isn't a better way. One idea is to allow a version of IMG
which takes an end tag. The contents of this element is the textual
description of the image, which can then be displayed by line mode browsers.
A further wrinkle is to allow the use of the <A> element in this text. This
allows you to specify polygonal buttons (using a new poly attribute) and
also to allow users to click them when using line mode browsers. Neat eh!

I hope to explain this in more detail in the new draft of HTML+ (thats if
you folks think it makes sense).

Dave Raggett

I believe that was one of the proposals suggested at the WWW conference
in July.  I'm for it.

to work once I've made contact. For instance,

		Western WorldWideWeb Weaver's Waggle (W^6)
	(Software Interest Group on Distributed Information Systems)

  The UCSF Center for Knowledge Management will be hosting the first
in a series of monthly meetings focusing on the development of the
WorldWideWeb and other distributed information systems such as Gopher and
WAIS.  This event is open to Web enthusiasts of all persuasions; we hope
to cultivate a sophisticated community of users, authors, and developers.
If you are writing Web software or documents, or are just generally interested
in distributed information systems, please email sig-web@ckm.ucsf.edu to let
us know you'll be coming.
  This initial meeting will feature a talk on SGML given by Terry Allen,
Editor of O'Reilly & Associates Digital Media Group.  The rest of the time
will be devoted to being excited about the whole thing and perhaps getting
organized (deciding on future meeting dates, locations, and topics).

Subject: HTMLPlus's content model
Cc: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Status: RO

Hi Dave,

Just want to point out that HTMLplus's content model could be further
simplified.

Definitions like these in the DTD:

	<!ELEMENT LI - O (P|%text;)+>
	<!ELEMENT DD - O (P|QUOTE|UL|OL|%text;)+ -- definition text -- >

are convenient because the presence of "%text;" lets one, for example,
start a list item without requiring a <P>. Like this:

	<UL>
	<LI> alfalfa <P> basil
	</UL>

This is great back when <P> was a separator. But now that <P> is
a container in HTMLplus, this becomes kinda messy (IMHO), because 
it allows one to write this (does not require <P> for first text):

	<UL>
	<LI> alfalfa <P>basil</P> clover
	</UL>

which maps to this ESIS (what SGML parsers generate):

	(UL
		(LI
			-alfalfa
			(P
				-basil
			)P
			-clover
		)LI
	)UL

I think this is a bit "messy" because I think <LI> should just be a
container of other containers. A bit pedantic, debatable, and may not
be a good thing for HTML backward compatibility concerns... But I'd 
suggest that perhaps such container definitions should be simplified.
In case of <LI>, to:

	<!ELEMENT LI - O (P)+>

In this simpler definition one would *have* to write the SGML this way:

	<UL>
	<LI> <P>alfalfa <P>basil <P>clover
	</UL>

And the ESIS would have to look more regular:

	(UL
		(LI
			(P
				-alfalfa
			)P
			(P
				-basil
			)P
			(P
				-clover
			)P
		)LI
	)UL



In other DTDs that I've checked out (DTDs in SGML books, DocBook, CALS 
(from what I heard), and other random DTDs), the simpler content model 
is used.

As browser implementor I can deal with either DTD models, but I prefer
the simpler model. As simple filter/translation program implementor, I 
would really prefer the simpler model. As document writer I might perfer
the currently more complex DTD model (or "simpler" from user's POV) 
because it saves me a few key strokes, and because it looks like the 
original HTML.

Just thought I bring this up before HTMLplus gets cast in concrete.

OK, qualified harmony.  I also think we're agreeing more than it
appeared to you, but I'll get to that.

Here's the best opportunity I've seen in a while to capture the current
discussion focus and move a couple of crucial inches forward on URNs.

We're talking baby steps, but we'll save a hundred hours at the IETF
armed with the following basic premises about URNs.  I'd like to open the
URI working group by voting on a resolution to adopt them (or on derivative
premises as this list see fit) before we begin the *next* stage of URN
definition.  Procedurally this will let the group summarily terminate
some of our more inane tangential discussions (politely, of course).

Foundation premises.  See if you can sing these verses, or maybe hum along:

(1) Documents, images, and other objects may be closely related enough that
    many people would agree they have the "same intellectual content".  An
    absolute or universal concept of "sameness", however, does not concern
    us since it's a Very Hard Problem and a Very Big Meeting Time Sink.

(2) Instead we're interested in "Who says What is the same or different".
    That way users benefit from different points of view, but they know
    whose point of view it is.  Users will need more than one point of
    view because Entity A may have an opinion about objects X and Y, but
    not about Z, which Entity B may have an opinion about.

(3) An entity that has an opinion on this subject (I'll call it an
    IdAuthority for now -- I can't find the URN paper) can be anybody
    in principle; familiar examples will be publishers and libraries.

(4) Two entities may have different opinions about any set of objects.

(5) The creator or owner (whatever that means) of an object may be one of
    several IdAuthorities for that object, or it may not be an IdAuthority.

(6) An IdAuthority assigns a unique string (call it an IdDesignator for now)
    to each object that is "intellectually different" in its view.  The
    IdAuthority name plus the IdDesignator make up a URN.
    
(7) The IdDesignator string is "officially" opaque, in the sense that it
    has no shared semantics across all URNs, *even* if it is widely known
    how to crack some of them (e.g., a Library of Congress catalog number).

We've agreed on the above points many times, but still treat them as open
questions.  I'm sure we'll all miss the pleasure of agreeing on them some
more, but can we try to ratify them soon in the interests of saving time?

Now for the baby step premises (building on the foundation premises).

(8) One URN may designate a set of "intellectually equivalent" objects
    (to the IdAuthority) or may designate just one object.

(9) If a URN designates a set of objects, individual objects in the set are
    called "variants" with respect to that URN.

(10)Variants may be derived from all sorts of transformations of one object
    into another, either by machine or by hand, but we don't deal with that
    Very Hard Problem.

(11)Instead we only need to know how to tell one variant from another in
    the set of variants (intellectually equivalent objects).  A string
    (which I'll call a "variant specifier") is used to identify a variant.

(12)A variant specifer is *not* carried below the URN level.  So a variant
    specifier never meets a URL.  Instead a lookup of the <URN plus variant
    specifier> produces a URL for that particular variant.  This Very
    Common Mistake wastes vast quantities of discussion time.

OK, now I haven't said what a variant specifier looks like or where it
goes (only where it doesn't go).  I believe there was some particularly
focussed agreement on the needs and issues up to this point: that

    "The properties of a given URN should be a valid question between
    client and server and beween the URN issuer and issuee." (Tim B-L)

These properties I've collectively called the variant specifier.  Now to
continue with the list of cautious premises.

(13)To paraphrase Tim, given a URN you should be able to ask some server
    to return you one or more variant specifiers, one for each variant.
    You select the variant you want, and pass it off together with the
    URN when you need to lookup the corresponding URL.

(14)For various reasons (e.g., optimization), you may get a variant
    specifier at the same time as the URN and packaged together with it.

(15)If you like the variant specifier, you may use it without needing
    to looking up other variants.

(16)If you don't like the variant specifier, you may want to go ahead
    and look up the other variants to see what else is available.

(17)The variant specifier is thus a thing that optionally accompanies
    a URN, at the same level in our UR* scheme of things.

(18)We need a new member of the UR* family for variants.  How about URV?

In my original proposal, I confused everybody by proposing 17 above as an
optional *part* of a URN, in order to avoid creating a new member of the
UR* family.  But people thought I was messing with the opaqueness
requirement when I only wanted to expand the URN concept.  The operation
I listed as URNroot(URN) --> URN was the trivial mapping of a <URN plus
variant specifier> to just the URN.  Whatever we agree on is fine with me.

Does the above list look like it can be formalized for the meeting?
If not, how do people feel about unbundling separate premises to vote
on a subset of them?

I sure would like to get these easy issues behind us, nailed down, dead.
Then we can move on to really interesting things, like URCs.

So, what you are saying is that

	URN + URV = URL

and that a URL refers to a single instance of a document at a single
locatation.

Although there may be some use of a URV within hypertext (and other
links), I would think that the typical case would be to just use an
unadorned URN, since I wouldn't know which variant would be wanted until
retrieval time.  It would seem that some sort of negotiation/protocol
would be useful here, even something as simple as what Gopher+ does
(return list of all variants/views).  This would allow for smart clients
to do the negiotiation.

As long as the URV is extendable, this looks like a good idea.  I would
opt for just 2 dimensions within the URV right now, location and format.

I also remember a proposal for a URM (modifier).  Would this work for
the URV?

Oops, I mean, to contraphrase Tim :-), remembering that contrapuntalism
is not antithetical to harmony!

I should have said "... to lookup a list of corresponding URLs".

No, I'm not saything that.  The pair <URN, URV> maps to one or more URLs.
More like a function call, urn2urlist(URN, URV) = {URL1, URL2, ... }.

For example, <"War and Peace", ASCII> might be in five locations (5 URLs),
and <"War and Peace", PostScript> might be in three locations (3 URLs).

The unadorned URN will be *a* typical case, say within hypertext or
within a search result record.  I think of that as the export case,
since that will be how many servers present links and references.

However, another typical case arises out of client collection activities,
which I think of as the import case.  The client may have very strong
notions about which exact URV it wants for a given URN that it is adding
to a local pile of links.  Next time it goes to de-reference those saved
links it will not want to redo all the variant selection it did once
before, which could have been a quite painstaking process.

	OK, qualified harmony.  I also think we're agreeing more than it
	appeared to you, but I'll get to that.

Wrong. We are I now see clearly *disagreeing*. You and I.
Check out what my last message actually said...
You say:

	(1) Documents, images, and other objects may be closely related enough that
	    many people would agree they have the "same intellectual content".  An
	    absolute or universal concept of "sameness", however, does not concern
	    us since it's a Very Hard Problem and a Very Big Meeting Time Sink.


	(2) Instead we're interested in "Who says What is the same or different".

*Disagree*. Whether two things arethe same should *NOT* be regarded
as a function of who you ask.  It is a function of what transformations
you are allowing which preserve "sameness".  As a person I reserve the
right to use different criteria for different purposes.  I want to
be able to give names to generic works, AND to particular translations,
AND to particular versions.  I want a richer world than you propose.
I don't want to be constrained by your two-level system of
"documents" and "variants". There are objects, which may be more or
less generic.  I may have many or no levels.

I was proposing that the properties of a name be given in terms
of the attributes of the document which may vary for the same
name.  This provdies a framework for actually talking about
what we *do* mean by "sameness".  It allows us to tackle the
problem without constraining ourselves. I feel your variant
specifier constrains the model without acually helping us much.



	    That way users benefit from different points of view, but they know
	    whose point of view it is.  Users will need more than one point of
	    view because Entity A may have an opinion about objects X and Y, but
	    not about Z, which Entity B may have an opinion about.

If youtry to map my world onto yours, you will need a large
number of virtual "entities" for each combination of criteria.

	(3) An entity that has an opinion on this subject (I'll call it an
	    IdAuthority for now -- I can't find the URN paper) can be anybody
	    in principle; familiar examples will be publishers and libraries.

You certainly can't link "entities" to real peopl eor IdAuthorities.

[...]
	We've agreed on the above points many times, but still treat them as open
	questions.

Wrong, John.  You have reiterated them, but noone has agreed them.
[...]
	OK, now I haven't said what a variant specifier looks like or where it
	goes (only where it doesn't go).  I believe there was some particularly
	focussed agreement on the needs and issues up to this point: that

	    "The properties of a given URN should be a valid question between
	    client and server and beween the URN issuer and issuee." (Tim B-L)

	These properties I've collectively called the variant specifier.  Now to
	continue with the list of cautious premises.


Hang on hang on hang on.  A property of a URN is like "any document
with this URN is in the same language".  Your variant specifier
spacifies a particular variant, not such a property.

	(13)To paraphrase Tim, given a URN you should be able to ask some server
	    to return you one or more variant specifiers, one for each variant.
	    You select the variant you want, and pass it off together with the
	    URN when you need to lookup the corresponding URL.

**NO**. This is more like contraphrasing me.  I don't believe in
variant specifiers, so I wouln't have said that.  I can imagine
saying "Give me a URN for a postscript version of document <urn>".
I can imagine saying "Give my a URN for a 600x300 pixel 5-colour GIF
of document <urn>".  I can imagine there being an infinite
number of possible variants on a document, so I wouldn't ask for a list.
But what I would get would be another, more specific, URN.

I guess this is abstract, but I think it is useful and simple.


	(18)We need a new member of the UR* family for variants.  How about URV?

Aaaaagh! :-)

	In my original proposal, I confused everybody [...]

Why stop now and spoil it :-) :-) :-)

	[...]Then we can move on to really interesting things, like URCs.

A good simple URN will take the world a lot futher than an
intricate gothic URC.  IMHO.  Because they will be used
for many other things than libraries.

	-John

Sorry for the strong emphasis... I want this to go places too.

Tim

John - I think that's a very good list, and I think the idea of voting 
(or at least a call for consensus) on them would be a good way to 
start the next meeting.  I'd propose that if their is disagreement on any
of them that it be made explicit so that it can be discussed and polished
off.  If adopted I'd suggest it be published as an Internet Draft, to 
establish it as a premise for further discussion.

Having said that, I think there is one point I disagree with - more in the 
wording than the meaning.  point 12 (I believe) said that a URV and a URL 
never meet each other.  I disagree, in a typical client application the URV
is a property of a URL.  I.e. having performed 
resolve(URN,URV) -> {URL1,URL2,URL3}
I'm going to hang on to one of the URL's (the closest?) and tack the URV and 
URN into a data structure with it.  This tells me the properties of my URL,
and allows me to make decisions about how to display it etc. I could even
see these getting written down somewhere e.g.


Where can I get a copy of URN:ISBN::1234567:::

Its in the library, try  URL=gopher:1/xxx/yyy URV=Content-Type: postscript

i.e. the URV is not something you need to know to retrieve the URL, but its
a valid peice of information to pass around with it.


I believe that the concept of URV is equivalent to URM as presented last
meeting, Lets pick one of the terms and stick with it - personally i prefer
URV but dont really care.

I'd like to add one more point to be consensed on, if their is consensus. 

"URC is defined as any combination of one or more URL's or URN's with 
optionally URV's. We havent defined what it looks like yet, but this is what
it is."

The reason I suggest this is that Dirk mentioned that a URV might have two
dimensions "location and format" - location is definately not one of the 
dimensions of a URV, its part of the URL. A URC might have two dimensions -
location and format - if its parts where a URL and a URV.

Sorry, I will try an example.  It's going to be HTTP, which
I had avoided as John wanted low level deatils kept out of it.

I have a document which has an interesting reference
with HREF="urn1".  To the relevant server (leaving out
any as yet undefined URN/L indirection lookup stage)
I ask

  GET urn1 HTTP/1.0
  Accept: text/html; application/postscript, text/docbook, vr/iso6598
  Accept-Encoding: compress
  Accept-Language: eng; fr q=.7; d q=.2

and get back

  HTTP/1.0 200 document follows
  MIME-Version 1.2
  Content-type: text/html
  Content-Encoding: 8bit
  Language: eng
  URI: urn1 vary=language, content-type, version
  URI: urn2 vary=content-type
  URI: urn3

Now I know that I can use urn1 (which coincidentally to be
the one I started with) to refer to this document in general,
which may exists in multiple translations, and may evolve in
time. I canuse urn2 to refer to this thing I am reading
in exactlythe same translation and exactlythe same version,
plus or minus on the conversion from one representation to
another (like rendering in postscript).  I can use urn3 to
refer to the bitstream I got back, which I will cache.

I will probably cache all thes urns, and the software may
decide to give me back the same bitstream whenever I ask
for urn1 or urn2 or urn3 again today.

When I make a link, I have the optionof which way
I link. Maybe different menu options appear,
"Link to doc", "link to version","Link to image".
Which one I chose depends on whether I am quoting
a good textbook, or pointing out a spelling mistake,
or pointing out a legally binding document.

Does that make it any clearer what I meant?

So the returned URI: lists the attributes that vary for a given URN.
Then it is up to the client/browser to specify which of those it
wishes to constrain (e.g., in HTTP using Accept: fields).

So for an image it might be:
    URI: img-urn1 vary="content-type,class,depth,width,height,xdpi,ydpi"
And audio might be:
    URI: au-urn2 vary="srates,widths"

Then the request might be:
GET img-urn1 HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif,class=color,depth=8,width=1024,height=768,xdpi=85,ydpi=85
X-Comment: This server probably has a postscript image since it
X-Comment: says it can convert it to just about anything for us.

[FYI: these examples come from the information in

Can we try and keep discussion of this topic to one mailing list. 

I'd like to appeal to anyone in the www list whose interested in this to
come over and join in the discussion on uri@bunyip.com (send requests to
uri-request@bunyip.com). Several messages recently have been posted to
one or other list, and not both so the discussion is getting fragmented.

Subject: Saving MPEGs

I've taken a look at several of the MPEGs noticed recently in 
NCSA's "What's New With NCSA Mosaic," but could not find a 
way to save them.  They seem just to disappear after they
are displayed.  When I retrieve a JPEG I am able to save it
with xv.  Is there a way to save these MPEGs?

The world needs a decent GUI-based MPEG player.  In the meantime,
Binary Transfer Mode was intended for just that (soon to be
reincarnated as shift-button1, probably).

What is it exactly that I need to reconfigure?  At the moment, out httpd.conf
file just reads:

 pass  /  file:/home/www/Homepage
 pass  /* file:/home/www/*
 pass  *

Is it something that should be put in there, or do I need to rebuild the 
daemon?

Thanks for any help

The server looks at the file extenstion to decide what kind of file it
is.  You can control this in the rule file with suffix lines.  Homepage
needs to be Homepage.html.  Here is a list that should cover most setups
(assumes long file names, but you get the picture):

#      <suffix>	<representation>		<encoding> [<quality>]
 suffix  .html	text/html			7bit
 suffix  .rtx	text/richtext			7bit
 suffix  .etx	text/x-setext			7bit		0.9

Can you explain what you see as the differences between:

    a)  "ROLE" of the link
    b)  "REL"ationship of the documents

Actually in the existing draft spec for HTML+ the LINK element can take
a ROLE attribute *but not* REL or REV.

I have been thinking about support for splitting large documents such as books
into smaller nodes offering low latency. It seems from this study, that LINK
isn't needed, and that you can get away with a slightly extended version of
the A element supporting bookmarks and hypertext paths.

Perhaps, we only need LINK for style sheets?

Subject: IEEE JSAC Call for Papers: The Global Internet

Of interest to the WWW crowd: the use of HTML as submission format.


          IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)

                              Call for Papers
                            The Global Internet


  The  Internet  has grown  from  the dozen  or  so nodes  of  the  original
ARPAnet to a collection of more than 15,000 autonomous networks with  around
1,800,000 hosts in 60  countries, forming the largest  data network ever  in
existence.  Its  exponential growth and  status as a  component of the  U.S.
National Information Infrastructure have significantly enhanced interest  in
the Internet in the past few years.   It also uniquely combines  operational
networks which large numbers of  educational, research and commercial  users
depend on with an experimental  network conducive to the rapid  introduction
of new  services.     Internet technology  has  found  widespread  use  even
in networks  not physically  connected to  the  Internet itself.    In  both
organization and  technical details,  the Internet  marks a  departure  from
customary telecommunications and data  networks, even though the  underlying
transmission technology is often similar.
  Many  of the issues faced  by the Internet  today, in particular  scaling,
heterogeneity, security over untrusted  links and integrated services,  will
confront both private and public (data) networks in the near future.
  Technical papers are solicited concerning key Internet  problems including
the following:

  o scaling and heterogeneity

  o novel applications for the Internet

  o routing, addressing and naming

  o support for mobility

  o integration of  new  technologies such  as ATM,  SMDS, frame  relay  and
    large public data networks with the Internet

  o information services and resource discovery

  o large-scale multicast

  o internet  multimedia,   such  as  real-time  audio/video   conferencing,
    signaling issues

  o quality-of-service issues in an internet

  o resource accounting and billing

  o privacy and security in internetworks

  Electronic   submissions  in  PostScript,   LaTeX  or  HTML  formats   are
encouraged.   Please  contact  Henning Schulzrinne  by electronic  mail  for
requirements.  Electronic  and paper submissions should  be sent to  Deborah
Estrin only according to the following schedule:

                 Manuscript submission:    February 1, 1994
                 Acceptance notification:  June 1994
                 Final manuscript due:     August 1994

The the online stuff is out of date.  Darn, I was hoping we had resolved this.

There shouldn't be a ROLE for <LINK> or <A>.  REL means relationship,
which can mean things like:

<HEAD -- Note that all LINK elements must be in the HEAD -->

<LINK REL="UseIndex" HREF="wais:directory-of-servers.src">
    When the user does a "query"/keyword_search use this URL instead of
    the current document.
    # the wais: url might not be correct but you get the idea
<LINK REL="UseGlossary" HREF="ftp:.../sewing.glossary">
    which means the brower can use "sewing.glossary" to lookup works
    from this document (instead of marking hundreds of words with
    hypertext links to the glossary).
<LINK REV="UseGlossary" HREF="abc">
<LINK REV="UseGlossary" HREF="def">
<LINK REV="UseGlossary" HREF="ghi">
<LINK REV="UseGlossary" HREF="jkl">
    This document is a glossary for all those files.  Might be useful for
    finding related information.
<LINK REL="Annotation" HREF="http://server/annotations/0123456">
    0123456 is an annotation of this document.
<LINK REV="Annotation" HREF="gopher:...">
    "THIS" document is an annotation of gopher:...  Useful if you
    are reading annotations like news and want to read the orig.
<LINK REL="Interested" HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/hyplan/sanders.html">
    Means that if "this" document changes then notify "sanders.html"
    by doing a POST to the specified URL.

----
    These could be used to control navigational aids,
    generate printed material, etc.
<LINK REL="Precedes" HREF="abc">
    Document "abc" precedes this one
<LINK REV="Precedes" HREF="def">
    Document "def" follows this one

<LINK REL="Made" HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/hyplan/sanders.html">
    The specified URL is the creator of "this" document.  If you want
    to send mail to the "owner" then just POST to that URL.

</HEAD>

Please Please Please read:
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Relationships.html

We need <LINK REL=... REV=...> *and* <A REL=... REV=...>

Subject:      Crawling info displays and slide shows
To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch

Last night, while watching the public information channel our university
offers through the local cable TV company, I was thinking it would be
nice to offer that same info via our CWIS. (The content is a mix of
campus events, new programs, phone numbers, scenes of campus, etc.)
Since this stuff is probably typed into a proprietary display tool on an
Amiga somewhere, I'd have to convince someone to retype the info into
another medium, or someone would have to develop a tool to export from
the proprietary display engine to another form.

But it occurs to me that maybe the opposite approach could be taken. Has
anyone looked into providing this sort of "crawling" display and/or
slide-show displays via World-Wide Web? Ie rather than expecting the
user to click on a choice, the document includes a URL to fetch next,
and a timeout to wait before fetching it. To completely simulate the
type of display I'm talking about, you could even give the client a type
of transition to do between screens -- a dissolve, or a page turn, what
have you. (I know, this gets into presentation issues, anathema to
some.)

With this sort of functionality in HTML and with specialized client
software, you'd put all this information in your CWIS, and you'd have
the TV station broadcast a feed from the CWIS, instead of working the
other way around. But the show would also be available for anyone coming
in over the net as well -- one effort serves both needs.

Please forgive me if this has already been addressed -- hard to keep up
lately.  Anyone already doing this sort of thing?

Mosaic for X 1.x (and even moreso in the coming 2.0) has related
"remote control" capabilities that quite a few people have used to
implement "slide shows" -- shell scripts that tell a running Mosaic,
via signals, to load various URLs at whatever intervals they want.
See
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/remote-control.html
for more details.

2.0 will enhance this by better handling multimedia data accesses and
by including scrolling/paging directives.

This gets close to what you're talking about, except that there's the
assumption a (shell/Perl/tcl/C) script is being run on the machine
with the client and controlling the client via "brute force" Unix
signals.  Would be nice to codify this into some standard,
transportable, transparent scripting mechanism...

Cheers,
Marc

Updates of the same UFL could be done via a

	<A HREF="blah" FREQ=300>

to fetch again every five minutes.  Then we could have

	<A REL="IsNext" FREQ=20 HREF="blah">

to fetch in 20 seconds, the next frame in a page.

Decision -- is 20 seconds from receipt of page or initiation of transfer?

Attributes such as frequency really do not belong in the actual HTML files.  It
is much easier (and cleaner) to write a seperate shell script/program that uses
the remove display capabilities of Mosaic to fetch the appropriate pages when
the need arises.  I think someone even posted a program here awhile back to do
just that.

The issue is whether the frequency information is in the link or in
the linkee.

We seem to have this issue whenever we want something new associated
with a link: frequency of update, type information, etc.

When you put it in the linkee, do you put it in the transfer method
(extend HTTP) or do you put it in the transferred data (extend HTML).

We had this issue for datatypes, and wound up putting type information
in the transfer method (extend HTTP to handle types).

Part of the problem is that we want to support more kinds of transfer
methods (gopher: and ftp: as well as http:) and also more kinds of
transfer data (.gif and .au as well as .html).
 
As for update information, I personally think that update information
makes sense in the linkee data. To deal with more kinds of things than
.html, put .gif and .au in some kind of wrapper.

As it turns out, this seems to work -- ECONNRESET is the more common
errno in this situation (the one I see) but I'll have Mosaic 2.0 check
for either...

With slow links and variable latency it seems it'd be better for
