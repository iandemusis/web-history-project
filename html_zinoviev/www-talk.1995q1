I am using Netscape (a browser) to handle forms for maintaining data on
NCSA's httpd (a server).  Sometimes only small changes to the data are
needed so that an IP (Information Provider) may be POSTing the form and
returning to it several times to upload data.  This is easier than filling
the whole form in each time.  I use perl to process the name-value pairs
and if there is an exact match on the POSTed data and a record in my files
then I issue an error message accordingly.

My version of Netscape does not ask the user if s/he wishes to rePOST the
form - it just does it repeatedly if asked.  I am using 1.0 in windows.  I
would be very disappointed if either of your first two options were
implemented as 'solutions' to this.  I think responsibility lies with the
webmaster or technical staff to ensure the integrity of the systems that
manage the data whilst, true to data prep principles, responsibility for
the data itself lies with the data owners.  On this basis it is my job to
ensure that the systems do not allow multiple POST's of the same data
whilst the quality of that data is down to the IP.

Accordingly, I agree with Ari that Mosaic's failure to rePOST a form full
of data is a bug, or at least an ill-considered feature.  My version 1.0
Netscape does a rePOST and not a GET on subsequent calls.

Alastair.

However, resubmitting the data IS a good idea if the first submit fails
because of authentication. For a long time there has been a bug in
several browsers which flushes POST data after the first transaction, 
and fails to re-send it with the authentication data. I believe that
this has now been fixed in NCSA Mosaic.

POST is also much more suited to uploading LARGE sets of data - I believe
the total length of a GET URL is limited to 512 (?) characters.

hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu is a good source for CGI information as also is
info.cern.ch.  Both of these sites run www servers containing copious
information on http, html and the CGI specification.

However, is it sensible for you to emulate http error messages?  Could I
trust the messages I receive from your server as being server generated and
correct for the error condition encountered?

I think a general consensus for this particular proposal was reached.

The disadvantage with Pragma: Keep-connection is that it can't be used 
with downlevel proxies because current proxy definitions pass along 
pragmas thus if a proxy doesn't support the pragma but both endpoints 
do, there's some poor interaction.  In this respect, I tend to prefer 
Alex Hoffman's SESSION method proposal.  It has the advantage you can 
send multiple requests at a time and the server serializes the 
responses.  In addition it works better across proxies and is more in 
line with HTTPng.  The disadvantage of the SESSION proposal is it 
requires more server and client mods, but I'm willing to live with that.

Alex, can you give a pointer to the current proposal?

John

Hi,
I have installed xvgr on my sparcstation  because i want to use gwstat.
However, some error messages appear on my screen when I run gwstat (see
below). Then, gwstat succefully invokes xvgr (I made a link from xvgr to
grbatch), but not in the batch mode; in fact, xvgr opens a window with a
plot but unless I quit  the program (xvgr) manually, gwstat stops on this
first window.
Could you please help me?
With many thanks,
Claudia Rallo

Here are the error messages I get at the beginning:

   A revised draft of the HTTP/1.0 specification is now available from

       http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
	ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
   and 
       http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

Roy,

Thanks for putting up the HTTP Working Group pages.  Though I've printed
out a copy of the postscript form of the HTTP/1.0 spec, I'd like to 
be able to browse that spec on-line, too.

I haven't been able to access the "HTML version" link from the
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/ URL you advertised above.
(Error 404
Not found - file doesn't exist or is read protected [even tried multi] )

However, I can access the "hypertext version" link from the 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html URL.

Am I correct in assuming these two links are meant to refer to the same 
content?  If not, when do you expect the ics link to be repaired?

I think, why would you reload a page unless wanted to resubmit?  As
you said, Netscape confirms with the user if it should resubmit.

You almost certainly end up with a different document.

Not a bad idea...  You could always go back and press Submit if you
wanted to.

Try the old tried and true CERN linemode client 'www'. It should be
available via www/ftp from www.cern.ch.

With 'WWW LineMode Browser version 2.15 (WWW Library 2.17)', I can
retrieve a GIF via WWW/FTP/GOPHER, etc for incorporation into other
programs, by running the following shell command:

www -source 'http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/link-anchor-br.gif' > lb.gif

You can easily execute such a sequence via system(3S) in a C program, or
as a command in a shell program.

'www' has a number of command-line options relevant to using the
program this way:

  -from format           Only if WWW is executed as a filter, this option
                         indicates the desired input format according to the
                         HTTP-specifications. The default value is "text/html".
                         
  -reformat              The output is to be in HTML, "canonicalized" so that
                         line breaks will be put in common places. Comments,
                         Command Line Syntax for the Line Mode browser (96/157)
                         processing instructions, etc, will be stripped.  This
                         feature allows HTML files produced by different
                         editors to be compared.
                         
  -source                Display the original source (without any MIME-headers)
                         of a document instead of parsing it. Has effect for
                         HTML from w3 servers, and news articles. (v1.2a or
                         later).  In order to get the MIME-headers, use the "
                         -to " command.
                         
  -to format             Format is the output format for www.  Default value is
                         "www/present" but may be changed according to the
                         HTTP-specifications. Two common output formats are
                         "www/source" that is the source without MIME-headers
                         and "www/mime" that is the source with the MIME-header
                         if any.  Though also "text/latex" is possible which
                         generates a LaTeX version of the (HTML) document.
                         This can then be compiled using latex and put out as
                         Postscript.

Subject: Introducing FFW - Freetext search For Web

FFW version 1.0
---------------

FFW - Freetext search For Web is a package made to provide easy-to-use 
freetext searching facilities over HTML documents (and as a special case 
plain text documents). The output is intended as input 
to scripts providing the user interface, typically CGI scripts. 

FFW is basically intended to replace similar solutions based on the
Wais search engine, and solves some of the problems we experienced when
using the Wais engine.

FFW is developed by the MultiTorg project at TeleNor Research, Norway.

The FFW info pages are at http://www.nta.no/produkter/ffw/ffw.html
Sources are at ftp://ftp.nta.no/pub/ffw

Sources are compiled under SunOS 4.1.3 with gcc 2.6.2 ONLY, those using
other systems might encounter problems. This IS version 1.0 :)
I do however not expect big problems making it compile on other systems.

FFW features:

- Traditional inverted index, considerably smaller than a Wais index.
  On test datasets we have seen FFW indexes at 1/3 the size of a Wais index.
  This of course will depend on data set size and content.

- Full HTML parsing on input, reserved HTML words are not indexed.
  Input parser can easily be replaced with parser for other formats.

- Low semantic content words like and, or, not, if, etc. can be filtered
  out of the index to reduce index size. This is done by providing exclusion
  lists.

- Flexible indexer, can take document list from input, stdin or parameter 
  files.

- Memory conservative merge program allows efficient incremental building of
  huge indexes. Two FFW indexes can be quickly merged into one. Building
  huge indexes can generally be a problem because indexer program size
  outgrows machine physical memory, leading to excessive paging load.
  ffwmerge solves this problem.

- Can search in several indexes at the same time.

- Self-contained index, does not need access to the data files to construct
  the user presentation. URL's and document 'title' are stored directly in
  the index, index server can be totally independent of the server holding
  the documents. No access to the source files needed to present the search
  result to the user.

- Written in compiled C++ for efficiency.

- Searching supports a formal expression grammar with AND, OR, NOT and ().

- Program messages are separated in one file for easy nationalisation.
  Norwegian and English versions are provided.

- Support for using several indexes with one CGI script, no need to use one
  script for each searchable area.

- 8-bit characters fully supported, HTML character escape codes are changed
  into their 8-bit ISO8859-1 equivalents where possible. This makes words
  with escape codes in them searchable.

I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

How would I register our site's WWW server at CERN's Virtual Library?
Someone recently told me about this, but the information wasn't complete.
Any guidance would be appreciated.

The address is http://www.nmc.vt.edu and it's the site for Virginia Tech's
New Media Center.

Thanks,
John.

NETSCAPE COMMUNICATIONS SHIPS RELEASE 1.0 OF NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR AND NETSITE
SERVERS

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 15, 1994) -- Netscape Communications
Corporation today announced the availability of the 1.0 versions of its
Netscape Navigator and Netsite server line, including the Netsite
Commerce Server with integrated security.  The availability of these open
software products, announced in September, enables Netscape Communications
to offer the first complete, secure client/server software system for
conducting commerce and exchanging information via the Internet and private
TCP/IP networks.

Netscape Communications also announced today that it is setting the
single-user price of its Netscape Navigator for commercial use at $39.  The
pricing -- which includes a 90-day warranty, 90-day online or phone
support, and diskette or CD -- makes it readily affordable for commercial
users, giving the largest potential number of users access to commercial
strength, supported technology.  Netscape Navigator 1.0 is available for
free downloading on the Internet for academic and non-profit use, as well
as for free evaluation purposes.

The Netsite server line includes the Netsite Commerce Server with
integrated security as well as the Netsite Communications Server.  The
Netsite Commerce Server, incorporating Netscape Communications' Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) based on RSA Data Security technology, is the first
secure server software available for the Internet.  When paired with
Netscape Navigator or other Internet browsers supporting SSL, the Netsite
Commerce Server lets users take advantage of such commercial services as
online publications, financial services and interactive shopping.

The Netsite Commerce Server and Netsite Communications Server deliver
power, efficiency, and ease of configuration and maintenance to
organizations, publishers, and information providers who want to create an
Internet presence.  The Commerce Server adds SSL security technology which
provides encryption for creating a secure channel to prevent others on the
network from tapping into the transaction, and authentication for verifying
the legitimacy of the server.  Both servers are based on the open
industry-standard HTTP protocol and are available for major UNIX platforms.

Available for all popular desktop environments, Netscape Navigator is a
powerful and secure commercial navigator for the Internet, offering
point-and-click network navigation.  It is optimized to run smoothly over
14.4 kilobit/second modems as well as higher bandwidth lines, delivering
performance as much as ten times that of other network browsers.  Netscape
Navigator provides a common feature set and graphical user interface across
computers running the Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, or X Window System
operating environments.

Netscape Navigator for free evaluation, academic or non-profit use can be
obtained via anonymous FTP from ftp.mcom.com.  Free evaluation use allows
individuals to use the software for the purpose of determining whether they
want to purchase an ongoing software license.  Academic and non-profit use
means that students, faculty and staff of educational institutions and
employees of non-profit organizations have unlimited free use of the
software.  Educational institutions and non-profit organizations can also
obtain a license free of charge to redistribute Netscape Navigator to these
individuals.  Organizations or individuals wishing to use Netscape
Navigator for commercial purposes can purchase supported, licensed copies
of Netscape Navigator directly from Netscape Communications.  Pricing
starts at $39 for a single user license, and volume discounts are available
for right-to-copy licenses for multiple users.

Also available direct from Netscape Communications, the Netsite
Communications Server is $1,495 and the Netsite Commerce Server is $5,000.

Customers wishing to order Netscape Navigator or Netsite servers can do so
on the Internet at
http://home.mcom.com

Subject: HTML Authoring support on HTTP Servers

Hello!
I am a novice to the world of Web. I would like to know if there are any HTML 
authoring (editors, etc.) that use special HTTP methods like PUT, LINK, etc. 
to edit an HTML document remotely. Are there any HTTPD servers that support 
this kind of remote editing or annotating?

Thanks much in advance for all the feedback!

Subject: Metainformation about arbitrary Objects..

Hello!
I am  fairly a novice in the world of Web. I understand the HTTP is very 
general purpose and one could have Newsgroups, or mailing lists configured
and accessed transparently through HTTP servers. I would like to know how
and what kind of meta information that one could produce on arbitrary 
objects such as Newsgroups, Mailing lists, etc. A newsgroup can have information
like name of the group, a number of articles posted, a newsgroup editor
(if any) etc. Can one provide all such information in HTTP headers? 
What would a browser do with such information?

Another related question is: if an application like mail is permitted then
posting a message is probably fine; however, how is one supposed to read 
his/her messages? All operations on a mail box are to be suitably converted
into hypertext source files, etc. Isn't this really bad? Are there any
HTTP servers on the Internet with which such services are being offered?

Thanks much in advance for all the feedback!

If you use Emacs to edit HTML (yes, I know, that's old fashioned but
hey I'm old) then here are a few of changes that might make life
easier for you.

1) (setq paragraph-start "^$\\|^^L\\|^ *<P>\\|^<BLOCKQUOTE>\\|^<DD>")
so that when you fill paragraphs it won't rearrange across
structural boundaries.  I know this list should include more
tags than this but these are the ones that I notice the most.

2) Modify ispell.el (you do spell check your documents don't you?)
to ignore HTML tags.  attached below is a diff for ispell 2.30

3) use html-mode.el.  I have also modified this to provide a small
amount of font hackery, not really WYSIWYG but still helpful.

See ftp://dri.cornell.edu/pub/davis for
  ispell.el 2.31
  ispell.diffs context diffs from 2.30 to 2.31, also attached below
  html-mode.el 2.3

Best wishes.  ps today is John von Neumann's birthday.

The HTML 2.0 draft includes a "META" element for encoding such information,
which is probably of limited use to most browsers, but of tremendous
importance to indexing applications like the ones that we build.

We are adding embedded support in our search engine for capturing Internet
news and mail headers automatically to fields, to simplify the most common
kinds of field capture that people want.

I suppose it would be quite bad if it were one's private mailbox, but for
mailing lists like this one, it can be an effective means of searching and
browsing discussions.  This list is part of such an archive that uses some
software I hacked together last summer.  It's available as part of the
Internet Virtual Library that we're building --

Hello,

hoohoo at NCSA doesn't seem to give out the CGI documents.  ("not found")
Does anyone know another place to get them, preferably from a FTP site?
Thanks to all.

You tried <URL:http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html>?  Just worked
for me.

There's also some info at <URL:http://www.charm.net/~web/Tutorial/CGI/>.

In the "teach a man to fish" category, I'll add the somewhat self-serving
(excuse the pun) information that we're indexed a bunch of Web-related
documents, including these, at <URL:http://www.verity.com/vlibsearch.html>.
It's still a bit rough -- we're building the list of sites that we'll keep
indexed; we're also building a Web knowledgebase to go with it.  My HTML
archives of this list and others are included (but I'll warn you that the
index and the documents are temporarily out of sync -- I just cleaned a lot
of old data out of the mail archives).

So, please whack on it when you've looking for information about the Web.
Feedback is welcome, as always.

We'll make a real announcement of it when we have a robust set of indexes
and the knowledgebase...

Oh, I just realized that there's a crude knowledgebase there already.  One
thing that's in it is a bunch of synonyms and such for "World-Wide Web,"
which is called "www-nicknames".  For example, if you wanted to search for
any reference to the Web (such as W3, WWW, etc.) and publishing, you might
enter a query like this:

www-nicknames <and> publish

A few other Topics in the knowledgebase:

www-servers (knows various names about httpds)
O'Reilly-names (will get references to ORA and its products)

Hello,

I am interested in implementing a batched HTTP transfer scheme.
We are building a local dialup network running on UUCP/Fidotech, with
only one node hooked up to the Internet, hitching on a university.
I'd like to have a way by which once a day, a robot on the IP node
(the WWW line browser, perhaps?) gets updates of certain WWW sites.
Or better yet, if it could somehow be informed by the site that a 
change has taken place.  Then, the web page, along with its local (on
the same site) cross-references, would be taken.

I was then thinking that this data would be encapsulated in a mail
message, or even a local USENET group, for easier distribution, with
appropriate MIME encapsulation of the pictures/sounds/binary data.
A decoder on the sites which will receive this would then transform it
back to the original page, except that of course the URLs that point
to things outside of the current batch would not be accessible.

Anyone have ideas on what software to use?  Has anyone done this
already?  Is it feasible at all?  It would be great since IP connectivity
is scarce in these parts.

Thank you, all!

Should escaped characters be in uppercase ?

The HTTP documentation is ambiguous..

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
http://www11.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/4_Recommentations.html#z1

Where the local naming scheme uses octet
values which are not allowed in the URL, these shall be represented in the
URL by a percent sign "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F)
giving the value for that octet.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I know that Lynx 2.3 sends lowercased escaped characters.

regards,
rob

Hi .... Does anyone know if there exists an online tutorial on the use of web browsers? We envision 
such a teaching aid to be included as a tutorial link off of our default home page. Any pointers or 
suggestions would be appreciated...

One brief note before we move this discussion and Roy gets really pissed at 
me for posting things in the wrong places. I think this is pretty important 
for many implementors, and currently the widespread use of GIF for inlined 
images has defacto become an important part of HTML.
We are going to be offering a free easy-to-use JPEG libraries for Macintosh 
and Windows to ease industry transition from GIF to JPEG. This will be 
usable in commercial implementations and the only restriction will be an 
"about-box" type credit (and liability wavers, etc). Hopefully these will be 
available by sometime next week.

	Thanks for the mention! May I remind everyone, or inform the

	<URL:http://WWW.Charm.Net/~web/>	(soon to become
	<URL:http://Stars.com/>, but still on good ole Charm.Net :*)

	OK: it's nice and fast! I searched for "cyberweb" (I can be
	self-serving too.. :*) and got back some docs that are only signposts
	I put up after a re-org some months ago. I just re-read the exclusion
	standards; robots.txt needs to go at the root of the Charm.Net URL?

	I did a search on "cgi" and got back a doc with a name I didn't
	recognise. Now although I have several hundreds of HTML files,
	like my children, I know most of them by name :*) I think you got
	the href from a file that has a Base tag pointing to another server.

	Could indexers let indexed sites know they've been visited?
	Then we could go in to check for such problems. People will
	probably think it's a bad link at my site :*(

	How often will you re-index? Another issue is updates and changes.
	If there are major changes it would be nice to be able to ask the
	indexers to re-index, else there will not be full info, or links may
	appear broken.

	I'd find it more helpful to have some text with an entry, e.g. an
	excerpt, a la Lycos. The score helps some if one has supplied more
	than one keyword. But this is part of the general indexing problem;
	we need something (Meta?) to hold a document's abstract/keywords.

	Why no Reset button on the search form?

	Finally, I used Lynx for (some of) this. It would help if the Submit
	button could be placed after the keyword entry field, not before. And
	it's a pain to get down to a returned doc because there are 3 cols,
	each is a link, the first looks to be of marginal use - especially when
	it keeps leading to "Expired session handle" (how many seconds do we
	get ?), the second 2 are the same links.

	Nice! I tried "www <and> systems <and> engineering" (self-serving
	yet again) and was mildly surprised that documents with those words
	in the title, and the body, didn't score higher than docs with those
	words only in the body.

	It looks like this is heading towards being a really useful tool!

	OK: as I'm not sure what you're not sure of, pls excuse if I
	explain the obvious :*). Relative URLs are normally understood
	to be relative to the directory the file is in. But the Base tag
	can make the URL be relative to any other directory - and on any
	other server. In the particular instance I had noticed, the file
	was in fact adapted from the TOC of Ian Graham's HTML tutorial;
	I didn't want to move all the sub files over so I just made the
	Base tag point to the original TOC - not on my server. So if the
	spider finds a reference in this file to "server-cgi-bin.html"
	it should realise I don't actually *have* that file - it's where
	Base says it is, i.e. some other server, in this case. If it doesn't
	want to go on sidetrips to other sites I guess it's just going to
	have to ignore relative URLs in files having Bases pointing to other
	servers.

Got it!  Now I understand what happened.  The spider doesn't know about
Base, so it tries to retrieve the file from the original server, which
doesn't have it.

I'll pass this onto the developers, so that they modify the spider code
appropriately.

Thanks!

Having seen examples of integreted conferencing on some web sites, I 
am very much interested in exploring the possibilities of 
establishing such a feature at my local web site. The most impressive 
example I have seen, has been Time Magazines' web site. I imagine the 
task of implementing an electronical  conferencing system involves 
Perl scripts or other programming efforts. Does anybody know of 
available examples on how to conduct this ???

[For those on the cc list, who may not have seen the news, Compuserve and
Unisys have decided to charge royalties for all software that uses GIF.
This being based on Unisys' patent for LZW compression, and (I assume)
Compuserve's copyright on the image format. The licensing agreement is even
worse than the royalty.]

As far as I'm concerned, this is not a battle worth fighting. If Compuserve
(although I suspect the blame lies more with Unisys finally deciding to
pursue software implementations of LZW) wants to force people to pay them
for software using GIF, we should just drop GIF like a hot-potato - it's
not worth keeping.

I'd propose the following.

1) (Moves are already being made in this direction.) Get code out there for
all existing browsers to gain JPEG support ASAP.

2) Draft a spec, similar in concept to GIF, but using an alternative
non-lossy compression mechanism - GNU's gz utility uses one (GNIF?), I'm
not sure if it's available in a form that can be used in commercial
software though. That will handle cases where lossy compression isn't
desired and/or JPEG compression results in a larger file than
straightforward compression. Don't worry about transparency, do allow for
N-bit colormaps instead of just 256.

3) Add a "mask" attribute to <img> which specifies an 8-bit grayscale mask
for handling anti-aliasing (aka "transparency").  Its argument is any
format supported by "src". That will more than make up for the loss of the
transparency option in GIFs. The only disadvantage I can think of for not
providing this in the image format is that you can't provide a mask with an
non-in-line image, but I think the benefits of doing this without creating
a new image format outweigh that minor issue.

None of this is rocket science. If those three things can be pushed forward
with a minimum of fuss, and no time wasted fighting with Compuserve and/or
Unisys, I think the Web could be using JPEG and GNIF as its primary format
within two months.  We'd also show that the internet isn't all flame and no
action - that kind of concerted movement around an obstacle would prove a
substantial warning to anyone else who thinks of playing this kind of legal
game in the future.

=46ighting the Compuserve/Unisys stuff isn't worth it. Mind you, I think the
negative publicity would cause Unisys to give up the fight within a few
months. But in the same time we could not only make their patent worthless,
we could also improve the standards available on the Web. No argument.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

Dear Prasanna,

There are a number of tools available to generate html documents, both
under Windows and in other environments.  In fact, Microsoft itself is
intending to release an add-on module to Word that will allow it to create
html documents.  This module was supposed to be released on the Microsoft
BBS at the end of December -- I don't know yet if they have met that date
or not.  Anyway, their next major release of Word, in conjunction with
Windows95, should be "html smart."  There are many other Windows based
HTML editors available for free or as shareware over the WWW including
HTML Writer, HTML Assistant etc. etc.  A good place to start for info on
HTML is -- where else! -- Cern, specifically
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html

In case you are interested, my company, HomePage Associates, is offering 
a "virtual class" which covers introductory HTML.  The first, protoype 
session starts next Monday, January 9, and we are intending to offer the 
class every month after that.  The cost is $100.  For more info, write 
hpa@halcyon.com -- or, better yet, check out our hommepage at 
http://www.halcyon.com/hpa/welcome.html

Yours,

Steve Habib Rose
HomePage Associates

I've created a new CGI tool called Browser Checkup to help identify the old
versions of the various browsers in use and lead users to the correct spot
on the Net (if any) to get the latest version. So, with each user having a
regular "checkup" we can hopefully make the web a more up-to-date place.
This is still alpha, but check out <http://www.city.net/checkup.cgi>. The
URL, name and metaphor will probably change, but the basic program seems to
work.  As I get more information from you the browser developers, I'll
support more browsers. I'm going to add an automatic check to the City.Net
home page as part of the testing stage, so when I detect somebody using an
old browser, I'll add a little note at the top of the HTML. Hopefully, this
will help over time to weed out all the users of old buggy browsers and
keep them in step with each new version of your software. Comments are most
welcome, but please send them directly to me, altis@city.net rather than
replying to the whole list.

I won't publically announce "Browser Checkup", except to this list, for at
least two weeks. Feedback prior to that time is much appreciated. You'll
want to access the URL with both old and new versions of your browser to
see the various results.

---
If you're a browser developer you can help me out by sending the following
information:

Browser name:
Platform:
Latest version #:
Latest release date:
URL to the home page for the browser and/or sites to get the latest version:
Example User-agent fields from both old and new versions of your browser:

I would also like to maintain a *short* paragraph of information on bug
fixes, new features (FORMs, TABLEs, etc.) in the latest release of your
browser as an incentive to get people to upgrade. If you have that kind of
information, pass it along.

Thanks,

ka

Maybe as a result server administrators will configure their server in
such a way that connections to compuserve addresses are denied (this is
fairly easy). Thus, Compu$erve can be kept from making money by selling
access to WWW - when at the same time they screw with Web developers
and users through such an incredible move. Grrr.

We've created a small demo of our URL-based searcher agent technology that
might not only be interesting, but useful to people on these lists.  It's
at <URL:http://asearch.mccmedia.com/embed.html>.

This is part of the Nexor page about robots, with our searcher agents
embedded in URLs after each description.  The searchers use Web
knowledgebase to find articles from our Virtual Library that related to
each of the robots.  At the top of the page is an agents that will search
the Virtual Library for all robot-related articles.

Interesting things are possible with this.  The owner of the search server
(us, in this case), can change the knowledgebase and the results of the
embedded searcher will change automatically.  For example, if a new robot
called "Marvin" became available, our editor would add its name to the
knowledgebase, so that any subsequent robot searches would include it, even
though the pages containing the searcher agents don't have to be modified,
as long as the name of the searcher agent hasn't changed.  Thus, the agent
could be in use on pages all over the Web, yet be maintained by the
knowledgebase editor.

Agents can be combined, too.  We're looking at creating an agent called
hot-news, which we'll edit periodically to find documents that relate to
whatever's hot on the Web.  By combining the hot-news agent with others, a
searcher agent URL could find recent news about specific subjects.  That
is, you could use "hot-new,www-robots" to find hot news about robots.  When
we maintain the knowledgebase, the results will change intelligently.

In theory we could change the color or appearance of the agent icon to
reflect the arrival of new information.

Feedback is welcome!

We'll be publishing the names of a bunch of our searcher agents as soon as
we're comfortable with the state of the knowledgebase and the contents of
the Virtual Library (both of which are very much under construction), so
that those who'd like will be able to embed them in their Web pages.

Nick

Hello!
I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question:

a. What are firewall servers? 
b. Are there any standards (like draft Internet RFCs etc.) on this?
c. Are there any public domain UNIX (or its derived versions) based
   firewall servers?
d. Is there any discussion list on this topic on the net?

Any information on these lines would be of helpful.

Thanks in advance!

NEWS ABOUT AUSWEB95

AusWeb95 will be hosted by Southern Cross University at the Ballina Beach
Resort in Ballina on the Far North Coast of New South Wales, Australia from
29 April to 2 May 1995.

There has been considerable interest in AusWeb95 and it seems likely that
the conference will be a sellout at 120 registrants as will the
preconference workshop with only 20 participants. We have always conceived
of AusWeb95 as being small enough that participants can meet everyone at
the conference and we have designed the program to maximise interaction.

=46ull details on AusWeb95, a form to register interests, photos of the
conference venue and of Ballina and nearby Byron Bay can all be seen at:

          http://www.scu.edu.au/ausweb95/

or email the organisers at

          mailto:AusWeb95@scu.edu.au

Copies of the AusWeb95 pamphlet are also available from the confernce
organisers.

OVERSEAS SPEAKERS

A number of overseas participants have indicated their participation in AusW=
eb95
and, following our assessment of the interests of participants (see below),
keynote speakers are currently being finalised.

SPONSORSHIP

We are pleased to announce that AusWeb95 is being sponsored by CISCO
Systems and other sponsorships are being arranged.

=46EEDBACK FROM CONFERENCE REGISTRANTS

The registration of interests form allows nomination of interests and space
to include other areas of interest. Following feedback from registrants on
the form and by email, we have been able to plan the conference to
accomodate most interests. The (near to final) program is as follows:

Dear Web-Folks:

How can I most effectively use www to announce new pages?

I have been announcing various web-pages here and there.  I would like to
sometimes announce new web pages to 1) appropriate subject sites, and 2)
the widest possible audience.

Please send me a list of sites that either collect new pages or categorize
new pages by subject.

TIA,

I would be interested to hear a lawyers opinion on the legal standing of this.
Compuserve were aware of the possible infringement of their copyright but did 
not issue a statement indicating their intention to enforce it, this sounds
very like the IBM case with respect to the PC. The point being that both IBM 
and Compuserve gained a commercial advantage from the widespread use of an
interface format. 

In any case the point is moot, Compuserve are not trying to claim the standard
they are being screwed by Unisys. Compuserve developed Gif in ignorance of 
Unisys intending to file patent claims. (Great patent system you got in the 
former colononies!) Otherwise they would probably have steered clear of it
and used somat else...

Patent rights are rather different because they are a grant of a monopoly and 
hence anti trust type considerations do not apply. Non enforcement does not
affect rights to enforce later.

Incorporating JPEG is not a big hassle.

Readers of www-talk might be interested in a new paper Tom Novak and I
have written on "Marketing in Hypermedia Computer-Mediated Environments:
Conceptual Foundations," which is concerned with the marketing implications of 
commercializing environments such as the World Wide Web on the Internet.

The paper is available in html and PostScript formats (along with other 
documents concerning the role of marketing in hypermedia CMEs) from our 
Research Program site:

At the moment, we're not weighting the document zones (which can be any
named element in HTML or SGML), although we have that capability.  It's in
the server; the indexer is lagging slightly behind.

I'm starting to believe that "Everything is under construction" should be
the standard Web signature -- and will be for quite a while, perhaps
forever... ;-)

Before this goes much further I recommend people *read* :-)

	http://www.unisys.com/LeadStory/lzwinfo.html

for information on Unisys's attitude to the use of LZW, along with

	http://www.compuserve.com/isd/news_rel/gif.html

for Compuserve's response to the new licencing deal.

As I read it Compuserve will only be charging *commercial*developers* of
programs which use GIF images whose programs are written after Jan 31st
1995. According their press release "CompuServe will not profit from
this service".

There is no general charge for storing GIFs or pulling them down from
other sites. This whole deal has been massively overhyped and there is a
lot of misinformation going around.

[BTW this in no way implies that I approve of Unisys's patenting of LZW
and the way they and Compuserve have handled the GIF issue. I also think
the development of a public domain GIF alternative could well be a good
idea]

Oh yes, for those proposing JPEG as an alternative --- I'm fairly sure
that IBM holds patents on the compression algorithms used :-)

Dear Friends,

While I agree with Chris that this recent move by Unisys is a blow to
the www community, I hesitate to support wholesale refusal of Compu$$
connections.  I am currently in the process of setting up a sub-domain
here and am faced with realizing many users can only gain an on-ramp
through the use of providers like Compu$erve.  If such a move to deny
connections were to be made I would strongly encourage appropriately
posting reasons to Compu$erve forums so that members understand why 
they are being denied the valuable resources of the WWW.  I personally
feel that the solution is to begin immediate support of JPEG and another
lossless compression scheme (like the suggested GNIF).  However, I think
this brings up an interesting point.  How are we able to notify all the
web server admin folks out there that the standards have changed and that
they are now supposed to use another method?  The registration lists are
a good start, but I think this will be an interesting test of how connected
we all really are. :-)  Best of luck to us all!

Ah, the invent-another-format position. Why? What is wrong with all the 
hundreds of existing formats?

While we are at it, there are actually two sub-options here:

2a) Use an existing format that uses non-LZW compression
2b) Use an existing format, and use the MIME content-encoding header to 
specify a suitable compression scheme. I notice that Arena already supports 
inline XPM (which is in dire need of compression, I admit).

> 3) Add a "mask" attribute to <img> 

Is adding to HTML 2.0 wise? Supposed to be about frozen - adding to HTML 3.0 
seems a better idea. So, add attributes to FIG and IMG

> which specifies an 8-bit grayscale mask

Hooray! Yes! Proper antialiased text in transparent graphics without having
to guess a likely background colour!

Again there are two sub-options:

3a) Have an external mask file for all image types
3b) Have the mask information inside the image file

> for handling anti-aliasing (aka "transparency")

Well, transparency and antialiasing are separate though related issues.
You can have an antialiased figure that has no transparency; you can have
a figure with transparency that is not antialiased. At present though,
producing a figuire that is both antialiased and transparent involves
making the assumption that the background is not too far from a mid grey.

>  Its argument is any

Well OK but then we need registration hints. What if the mask and the 
image are different sizes?

Again, a new format need not be defined. There are loads of valid arguments 
that could be put forward on the merits of 3A or 3B, but the labour of 
creating a new format is a spurious one. Just use an existing format that has
an alpha channel. TIFF 6 springs to mind as the obvious candidate: AVS X image 
files, Photoshop files etc are other, less suitable examples. TIFF does of 
course have a freely available library which can be linked to, so inline 
TIFF should be fairly easy to add.

I agree that this would be unproductive.

There are several of these groups.  Try joining one or more of the 
following:

comp.infosystems.www.misc
comp.infosystems.www.providers
comp.infosystems.www.users

There are the ones that my news server has, perhaps yours has them as 
well.

There is an advantage to doing something incremental off of the existing
format - it speeds the acceptance. In fact, a proposal (and implementation)
have already been made for an LZHUF version of GIF, but it doesn't always
compress quite as well.  But (as someone else pointed out) TIFF might be
the way to go for an alternate. The only concern I have there is to make
sure that the overhead for small images isn't too high.

2b doesn't really solve the problem for other uses of the format though. I
think any solution has to take into account the millions of other files in
GIF format.

I'd prefer 3b, since it's easier to manage, but practically, I think we
have to do 3a, since modifying JPEG to add a mask doesn't seem terribly
practical. (Although, masking a lossy compression file may not be very
practical either).

>Well OK but then we need registration hints. What if the mask and the

Ugh. I suppose an xoffset and yoffset setting would work, but I'd rather
just disallow it.


(BTW, I've seen no activity on this mailing list in weeks, has it lulled,
or did I get dropped somehow?)

Would some kind soul please post this alleged "announcement"? So far I have

As an owner of a company that is just finishing up setting up it's own web 
server, I will agree with what has been said.  It will not hurt for us to 
just simply move away from gif and adopt JPEG...it will provide for faster 
WWW for those on a SLIP account...and these numbers are growing.

I will vote for the change :)

try the netscape home page at http://mosiac.mcom.com/home/welcome.html.  
That site has some tutorial on Netscape...  Also, if you are using Mosiac, 
try http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SGD/Software/Mosiac/.  That has some mosaic 
specific tutorials.  From the Mosaic home page i listed, there are some 
'begininers' links too.  Have fun.

I just read a very interesting proposal:

From: "Electronic Commerce Standards for the WWW (Spyglass)"
http://www.spyglass.com/techreport/stdsec.htm
Tue Dec  6 21:54:52 1994

|Simple Authentication - OPTIONAL
|
|This scheme, proposed by Spyglass, uses a random challenge sent from
|the server to the client. The client encodes the random challenge
|using the user's password as an encryption key in order to establish
|authentication. See Note B for a full specification.
|
|This method is currently indicated as OPTIONAL, but Spyglass believes
|that it should become REQUIRED for HTTP compliance.


This was something of an eye-opener. It's so simple. We should have
been doing this all along. There was never any reason to send
passwords in the clear (well, uuencoded), given HTTP's two-round-trip
authentication mechanism.

Why is this nifty proposal tucked away in a corner? Why didn't I hear
about it before now? I thought I was pretty tuned in to this sort of
thing...


For the longest time, I was under the impression that the web user
base would have two choices:

	1. Use a free browser, and access only public information, or
	send your password essentially in the clear to subscribe to
	for-pay info.

	2. Use a commercial browser that supports the security
	options (SHTTP, SSL, kerberos...) supported by the services
	you use.

The reason I believed this was that real security is to expensive to
develop to give away (and it almost always requires a license of some
kind...).

As a result, information providers are faced with the unfortunate
choice between:

	1. Require users to send passwords essentially in the clear.

	2. Require users to license a browser.


This message is a call to eliminate passwords-in-the-clear from HTTP.
This means the browser developers should implement something like the
spyglass proposal (it looks like a few hours more work to upgrade to
this from the existing basic auth. scheme), and subscription-based
information providers should _strongly_ encourage their user base to
upgrade. Something like:

	"Please upgrade to a browser that doesn't send passwords in
	the clear (such as... links to recommended browsers.). In 6
	months, we will not be accepting Basic authentication."


I suggest that Spyglass lead the way by releasing source code patches
to lynx and Mosaic to implement this enhancement, just to show how
it's done. It should be a "simple" excercise for them.

Using high-quality services on the web should not be an incentive to
send passwords over the net in the clear. Let's fix this!

Dan

p.s. I hear s-key is another simple technology that eliminates the
need to send passwords in the clear. But for the life of me, I can't
find a technical description of it. Is there an RFC that I just can't
find? Could somebody send me a pointer?

Eric from Spyglass posted to www-talk a proposal for using MD5 encryption 
in a system like this a few weeks ago - it looked solid, and I'm waiting 
for a server and a browser to implement it (WN and Arena maybe?) so I can 
set it up for HotWired.

Only until 1997!  :)

>From a quick glance at the list of browsers used on our site, less than 
%2 are more than 4 months behind the current rev of their browser, so I 
don't see that as a huge issue.  However the above statement implies that a 
server can negotiate which type of authentication can be used:

S: Here's a challenge.  Encrypt it.
C: Huh?  
S: oh, nevermind.  Send me your uuencoded password.
C: okay, here goes....

..which doesn't seem to be in the specs anywhere.  I'd prefer not to 
have two separate URL's for different authentication schemes, though I 
could hack around that by keeping around a list of browsers implementing 
challenge-response.

The HTTP documentation has nothing to do with it.  Try the URL spec
(RFC 1738) or the WWW URI spec (RFC 1630).

The answer is that the escape is case-insensitive, with either
uppercase or lowercase allowed.  This is consistant with the behavior
of most hex-reading/writing functions.

[moved from www-html@info.cern.ch]

It is my opinion (and only my opinion) that the posted CompuServe GIF
Agreement does not apply to the WWW or products intended to use the WWW
for obtaining and rendering GIFs.  It is clearly restricted by the
following definitions:

> 11.2.	"Field of Use" means software provided by CompuServe or Developer and 
> used by subscribers to the CompuServe Information Service to access the 
> CompuServe Information Service or use information obtained over the 
> CompuServe Information Service which utilizes the technology of the Licensed

> CompuServe Information Service and for manipulating and viewing data 
> received 
> through the CompuServe Information Service,  and any new Products as may be 
> added pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement.

In other words, this is a classic "cover our asses" agreement and has
no applicability outside the domain of CompuServe.

      The opinion above was confirmed by a VP of CompuServe later

      Unisys LZW patent is a separate issue -- whether or not it can
      be successfully enforced against Web developers is unknown.]

Well yes. But now that Unisys have pressured Compu$erve into claiming GIF 
as their own, there is a problem. If you make something like GIF and don't 
call it GIF, it is effectively a new format which may, as you say, slow down 
acceptance. If you call it GIF95 to speed acceptance, then Compu$erve own it and
it is to be used "primarily for files obtained directly from Compu$erve" and 
all the other stuff they threw in that went far beyond what UniSys pushed 
them into.

Overhead? Ah yes, oops. Here is a small ( 14 by 14 pixels) gif like 
you see all the time for pretty balls on lists ;-) It has 40 similar 
shades of red in it.

The converter I was using does not support Huffman compressed TIFF or JPEG 
compressed TIFF so I could not test those. I see that packbits is pretty useless
on this example and lzw, obviously, is not a wise choice at present ;-)

Imconv is similarly limited. Here is what imconv can do when reading and writing TIFF:

tiff    Tagged image file
        a.k.a.:   tif
        Creator:  Aldus, MicroSoft, and NeXT
        Read support:
          1-, 4-, 8-, and 32-bit color index images.  24-bit RGB and 32-bit
          RGB+alpha images.  Standard (uncompressed), Mac Packbits, and Lempel-
          Ziv & Welsh compression.
        Write support:
          1-, 8-, and 32-bit color index images.  24-bit RGB and 32-bit
          RGB+alpha images.  Standard (uncompressed), Mac Packbits, and Lempel-
          Ziv & Welsh compression.

Although TIFF can do 24 bit images, note that a pallette (256 colour) TIFF 
has been generated here.

cguhpc [144]: tiffinfo reddot.none.tif
TIFF Directory at offset 0xcc
  Image Width: 14 Image Length: 14
  Bits/Sample: 8
  Compression Scheme: none
  Photometric Interpretation: palette color (RGB from colormap)
  FillOrder: msb-to-lsb
  Document Name: "Standard Input"
  Image Description: "converted PNM file"
  Orientation: row 0 top, col 0 lhs
  Samples/Pixel: 1
  Rows/Strip: 585
  Planar Configuration: single image plane
  Color Map: (present)
  
With widdy little images like these, the tags and stuff and the 
pallete start to take up a lot of the file, proportionately, compared 
to the actual pixel data.

Actually, raw ppm files are not too bad.

cguhpc [145]: giftoppm reddot.gif > reddot.ppm
-rw-r--r--   1 lilley   users        601 Jan  9 20:40 reddot.ppm

especially if gzipped

-rw-r--r--   1 lilley   users        274 Jan  9 20:40 reddot.ppm.gz

Ha! smaller than the GIF. Also, ppm is very definitely in the public domain, 
no company owns it.

Well if you apply that logic, then a separate alpha file doesn't help other 
users of the format either, it needs to be all one file for their convenience.

Masking a JPEG compressed file is certainly going to be tricky. 

Remember, folks, while glibly talking about "a JPEG file" we mean one of 
two things:

1] A JPEG JFIF file, ie a format
2] A file format that uses JPEG compression, such as TIFF, CGM, etc etc

xofset and yoffset use what units? Pixels? Ems?
Not trying to be picky (honest!) but this does impact the discussion about
compositing, (partially) overlapping multiple images, vector overlays on 
pixel images, and such that came up just before the Yuletide break.

For a single image and a single, separate mask there are these options:

A] stretch or shrink the mask to fit the image
B] map the mask onto the top left/ top right / centre/etc of the image
C] replicate the mask as a tiling
D] ignore non-registered mask data
E] throw a fit and dump core
F] map the mask onto some offset with defaults 0,0 (top left? bottom left?)

For a single image with an integral, optional alpha channel, like TIFF, there 
are none of these problems. Then again, if you want multiple overlapping 
images composited together and a single mask over them (do we?) clearly the 
mask must be in a separate file.

I just got all the messages from 1 Jan onwards in  the last hour or so. I 
assumed it was our flakey mail server but if you see that behaviour too, it 
may well be the CERN list server.

Couple more file types I should have included:

That's ZSoft paint PCX, SGI Iris RGB, Utah RLE ( a contender, I forgot), 
AVS image format and NCSA hierarchical data format.

Here's the blurb from imconv about rle, from the 
University of Utah:
rle     Utah Run length encoded image file

        Read support:

And here is the scoop on HDF. Note that Mosaic for X can be compiled to have 
inline HDF already. It has supported it for a year or more:

          Raster-8 tags included.
          
HDF is not just an image format though. I did notice a second or two delay
converting to hdf, the others were fairly instant.

And, for completeness, the gzipped sizes:

Yikes! Jinks! I asked for a reference to s-key in my p.s.
Brian replies to other issues, but includes the address of
his home-page.

Dan wastes a little time surfing Brian's home-page, and subconsiously
follows these links...

Which has a handy reference to the S/Key paper from bellcore:
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/thigpen/docs/security_papers/ISOC.symp.ps


After reading the S/Key paper, I think we should consider it in place
of the simple challenge/response system.

Advantages of S/Key:

	* passwords are _not_ stored on the server side in clear
	form.
	* user can securely use the same password at different sites
	* password can be changed without sending it over the net

Drawbacks:
	* server-side passwd database is not read-only: server must
	update the user's count of logins each time
	* doesn't support the opaque="..." feature of the spyglass proposal

Unisys Clarifies Policy Regarding Patent Use in On-Line Service Offerings


The concerns, inquiries and some apparent confusion that have resulted from
the December CompuServe advisory clearly indicate that we need to clarify
our policy concerning the use of the Unisys Lev Zempel Welch (LZW) patent by 

software developers for the major on-line services.

We want to reiterate earlier communications that the issue of patent
licenses is not focused on the end users of on-line networks, including the
Internet.  We encourage end users to continue to take full advantage of the
outstanding benefits of a rapidly growing on-line community.

Unisys was awarded the patent in 1985.  We became aware of the increasing
interest in our LZW patent beginning in 1990 when many companies approached
us to license the patent for their hardware and software products.  The
growth in the use of compression technology was mushrooming in order to meet 

the demands for transmitting increased amounts of data.  To date, more than
100 companies, including hardware, software and on-line information
services, have licensed the Unisys LZW technology.

Two years ago, Unisys learned that the LZW method was incorporated in the
GIF specification and immediately began negotiations with CompuServe in
January of 1993.  We reached agreement with CompuServe on licensing the
technology in June 1994, which calls for CompuServe to pay Unisys a royalty
of 1% of the average selling price it charges for its software.  This
represents approximately 11 cents for each copy sold and connected to its
information service.

Under the agreement, CompuServe, at its discretion, could relicense the LZW
technology to commercial developers using the GIF specification in software
that connected directly to the CompuServe information service.

With the agreement completed on June 21, 1994, CompuServe was given six
months to implement the terms of its license.  CompuServe later asked for a
one-month extension, which we granted.

Unisys did not require CompuServe to pass on any fee to its sublicensees or
end users.  Such a decision, and the content and timing of CompuServe's
advisory, was at their discretion.

Consistent with the entire information industry's desire to protect
intellectual property, Unisys will expect all of the major commercial
on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license
the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate.  The on-line service
companies are not required to sublicense the technology to developers
producing software for the commercial on-line services. It will be, as it is 

today, at the on-line service's discretion as to whether it charges a
license fee to developers or chooses an alternative method to account for
its licensing fees payable to Unisys.

We recognize and are concerned --  thanks in large part to the recent and
very active use of the on-line network -- that developers did not understand 

that the patented technology was resident in GIF.  Taking that into account, 

Unisys does not intend to pursue previous inadvertent infringement by
versions of GIF-based software products marketed prior to 1995.

Concerning all future software product development and enhancement of
existing products for accessing on-line services, Unisys expects developers
of commercial, for-profit software to secure a license from Unisys, or
through the licensed on-line service, for the use of the patented
technology.  The very reasonable terms should prove no financial barrier to
the introduction of product into the on-line network.

Unisys does not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial,
non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line
services.

Concerning developers of software for the Internet network, the same
principle applies.  Unisys will not pursue previous inadvertent infringement 

by developers producing versions of software products for the Internet prior 

to 1995. The company does not require licensing, or fees to be paid for
non-commercial, non-profit offerings on the Internet, including 'Freeware'.


Commercial developers of GIF-based software for the Internet are expected to 

secure a licensing agreement with Unisys for software products introduced
beginning in 1995, or enhancements of products that were introduced prior to 

1995.  Again, terms should not preclude the entry by these firms into the
marketplace.

For organizations introducing World Wide Web servers and 'Home Page'
offerings, most will not be required to secure a license from Unisys.  Most
organizations acquire software from other developers to create their
offerings on their servers.  Therefore, only the software firms who sell the 

enabling software for profit would be expected to secure a licensing
agreement from Unisys.

Unisys understands that this issue has caused concern.  We want to reassure
all users and developers that we are strong proponents of the on-line
industry.

 We're proud that this important Unisys technology has played a role in the
introduction of innovative products and services, many of which are fueling
the explosive growth of the information superhighway.

As members of the information community we want to strike the appropriate
balance between information access and the rights of all information
companies, including the developers of software, to protect their
intellectual property rights.

Except that many inline images are simple enough that they are smaller as 
a GIF than as a JPEG.

I don't think Kevin wrote it, he converted an existing lisp (i think)
version of hypermail into C.

I've also hacked Hypermail for use as a conferencing system.

http://xxx.lanl.gov/Announce/

We use it as a means for people in the physics community to make
annoucements about conferences and jobs. It works better than conventional
USENET groups since the announcements are available indefinitely, so
you can browse them whenever you like, without worrying about missing
an important annoucement because your local news is only kept for a
day or two.

Most of the web conferencing systems I've seen don't seem to have any
direction, they appear to have been written just for the sake of writing
something, rather than to serve some useful purpose. USENET does a good
job of providing a forum for anyone and everyone to communicate; if a
web conference fails to offer any advantages, then it is doomed.

regards,
rob.

	TIFF is good
	TIFF supports 1bit to 24 bit images
	TIFF supports many styles of compression
	TIFF supports real alpha chanels (transparency)
	TIFF supports JPEG compression
	TIFF supports X, Y, and LWZ compression
	TIFF supports comments
	TIFF supports copyrights
	TIFF has a freely available library and is well debugged
	TIFF is supported by most all paint applications (GIF, JPEG are not)
	TIFF is good

Remember the pattent doesn't affect reading image formats, so LWZ compression
don't have to be licensed by the client.

This proposal utilizes RSA MD5 encryption.  If you have this 
capability, why not go all the way to SSL (or SHTTP)?  It would
make much more sense.

I don't see how this proposal fixes this problem.  It requires MD5 which
will require a license from RSA.  How does this not fall into your class
2 space?  As long as I am in that space, I would much prefer a protocol
which has been widely adopted by the financial community (e.g. SSL).

Hello fellow Webweavers,
there is NO NEED to panic... please read compu$erves statement on their web 
server, and you will all soon find out that Compu$erve actually welcomes the 
use of GIF on the Web and on internets in general.

For those not directly at browser right now, here is a little excerpt:

--- schnipp ---
CompuServe remains committed to keeping open the GIF 89a specification both 
within CompuServe and in areas outside CompuServe. CompuServe continues to 
strongly support the use of the GIF specification in the entire online 
community including the Internet and World Wide Web. This agreement will be 
transparent to
end-users and will not result in any charges for people using viewers or 
transmitting GIF images.

Cheers,
Tim

The basic difference between those two approaches is where the  
"browsing smarts" reside -- client or server.  The path of your  
explorations suggests some of the pros and cons:

Pros for the server-side approach:  the browsing interface can be  
customized for the topic at hand and, more importantly, it can be  
instantly upgraded without all the distribution problems of ordinary  
software.   (Presumably these reasons attracted you to the server  
approach in the first place.)

Cons:  server-side smarts can be a heavy burden to both server and  
client.  The server must maintain "account" information for large  
numbers of users, even though the majority will make only brief use  
of the system.  And the user has the burden of trying to keep track  
of all the accounts on different servers.

In other words, both pure-client and pure-server approaches have  
serious disadvantages.  What is really needed is a client/server  
balance.

For example, if the amount of "user customization/preference" info is  
not overly large (up to a few 10K), server-side smarts can still be  
made efficient by relying on the client to store the user-specific  
info between sessions.  This can be done conveniently with current  
Web tools by providing users with a log-on page (laced with hidden  
form fields) that they can save on their own machines, and then  
resubmit to start a new session.  This allows the server to only  
maintain short-lived "session" state, rather than long-lived "user"  
state, and so is much more efficient.

Of course, more sophisticated client/server balancing is possible.

I tottaly agree.  I've had a Compu$erve account which I havn't used for 
about 5 months.  I've been meaning to cancel the account and this is a darn 
good reason.  I've also added compuserve.com too the list of URL's we DO NOT

person at Compu$erve we can mail our thoughts to?

MD5 technology is very different from the patented public key encyption.
It's just a secure hash function. There are others -- SHS, MD4, etc.

Anyway... the md5 source code is all over the place. There's an md5
module in the Python distribution, so I'm pretty sure there are no
prohobitive licensing restrictions.

At the risk of sounding a humbugger, take this to one of the
comp.infosystems.www.* newsgroups, where it is already being done to
death.  Likewise in comp.graphics.  www-talk is no longer a suitable
forum, IMHO, for this discussion.

Some notes from the USENET side of things:

While www-talk was (so far as I could tell) adjourned, through the
first week of January, there was quite a bit of discussion of
alternatives to GIF on various USENET newsgroups; comp.graphics seems
to be getting most of the interesting traffic.  The two alternatives
about which there is most talk are:

1) Modified GIF, with LZW replaced by an unencumbered compression
   scheme.  (A company from Telegrafix has even offered to make code
   for GIF-LZW+LZ77 (gzip compression) freely available).

2) A new format, tentatively called PBF (although there's been a whole
   lot of hoo-hah about alternative names), being spec'ed out by Tom
   Boutell.  I'm including the most recent draft spec that's arrived
   here below.

The Boutell proposal in particular has seen a *lot* of comment; people
discussing other alternatives here should probably at least be aware
of it.

One further note from the general discussion --- in answer to why yet
*another* new format, the general response seems to be that no other
common format has *all* the features of GIF that matter to people
(transparency, interlacing, good compression for icons, etc.), so it's
either a modified GIF or something totally new; we might as well see
what the latter would look like.  I'm not endorsing this position
myself --- just letting you all know that it's out there.

PBF (Portable Bitmap Format) Specification, Second Draft

By Thomas Boutell, boutell@netcom.com, 1/7/1995

This is the second draft of the PBF specification discussion
document, replacing the first draft and taking many suggestions into 
account.  However, I have refrained from adding many suggested
capabilities in order to keep the format simple and
reasonably easy to implement. There are many significant
changes from the first draft, particularly the addition
of truecolor.

This draft proposes use of the inflate/deflate compression scheme,
an LZ77 derivative which is used in zip, gzip, pkzip and
related programs, because extensive research has been done
supporting its legality. However, there is still room for
discussion of the specifics, and for the proposal of
other schemes. The author is not a compression
maven, and is not in a position to personally write
reference inflate/deflate code. inflate.c in the gzip
package is not GPLed, but deflate.c is, so
commercial vendors of PBF-creating programs will want to
roll their own. Of course, an unrestricted specification of the 
compression scheme is provided in the pkzip package, so there is no
barrier to doing this. (See algorithm.doc in the gzip package
for references.)

(Does anyone know of a completely copyrightless version of 
deflate.c? It would lower the ante.)

This draft is intended solely to generate comments and
does not represent the final standard.

Hello, Compuserve folks! This draft will be posted to Compuserve as 
well as to comp.graphics.

Data Representation Note

All integers which are not 1 byte integers will be in
network byte order, which is to say the most significant
byte comes first, and the less significant bytes in
descending order of significance (simply MSB LSB
for two-byte integers, B3 B2 B1 B0 for 4-byte
integers). References to bit 7 refer to the
highest bit (128) of a byte; references to
bit 0 refer to the lowest bit (1) of a byte.

The Format

The Identification Header

The first four bytes always contain the following
ASCII characters:

.PBF

(The dot is included to avoid confusion with files
such as this one which discuss PBF as opposed to
being PBF files themselves.)

The Main Section

The remainder of the file consists of a series of
chunks, where each chunk consists of a 2-byte,
UNSIGNED chunk type (ranging from 0 to 65535), 
a 4-byte, UNSIGNED length (not including itself or the
chunk type), and the data bytes appropriate to that
chunk, if any. Note that this provides for a chunk
to be skipped even if the implementation does not
recognize that particular chunk type.

Chunk Ordering

Chunks must appear in ascending order (by chunk type) in
the file. This enforces the common-sense requirement that
dimensions, etc., appear before image data, while
simulataneously leaving room for extensions that are
also important or necessary to know about before the image data 
itself arrives (note that I'm allowing for streaming data).

Necessary and Ancillary Chunks

Even-numbered chunks are necessary in order to properly
display the contents of the file. If an implementation
encounters an even-numbered chunk type it does not know
how to handle, it must indicate this to the user and
either not display the image or warn the user that 
the file contains an extension the program does not
understand. Even-numbered chunks are referred to as
"necessary" chunks from now on. The dimensions chunk
is an example of a necessary chunk. A hypothetical
vector-graphics chunk would also be a necessary
chunk, since without rendering it the image would appear
to be blank, or would contain a background bitmap
with no other information.

Odd-numbered chunks are ancillary information that enhances
the image in some fashion, but without which the image
can still be successfully displayed.
Examples are the comment, copyright and gamma-
correction chunks.

Proprietary Chunks

If you want others outside your organization to understand
a chunk type that you invent, CONTACT THE AUTHOR
OF THE PBF SPECIFICATION (boutell@netcom.com) and
specify the format of the chunk's data and your
preferred chunk type. The author will assign a permanent,
unique chunk type. The chunk type will be publicly listed
in an appendix of extended chunk types which can be
optionally implemented. In the event that Mr. Boutell
is unable to maintain the specification, the task will
be passed on to a qualified volunteer.  

If you do not require that others outside your
organization understand the chunk type, you may
use a chunk type between 49152 and 65535. Values
in this range will never be assigned in the
public specification. Please note that if you
want to use these chunks for information that is
not essential to view the image, and have any
desire whatsoever that others not using your
internal software be able to view the image,
you should use ancillary (odd) chunk types.

Required Chunks

All PBF implementations must understand the following
chunk types in order to be considered
PBF-compliant. All implementations must understand
and successfully render the even-numbered (necessary)
chunks below.  Standalone image viewers
should also be capable of displaying the ancillary
chunks below, such as the copyright notice,
but this is not necessary for applications in which
many images may be displayed at once (ie,
WWW browsers).

Chunk Type    Description

0             Dimensions (data is x and y, 2 bytes apiece;
              maximum dimensions are 65535x65535)

8             Bit depth. Data is one byte, containing the value
              1, 2, 4, 8 or 24. The first four will have palettes
              unless they are grayscale; 24 signifies truecolor,
              in which each pixel will have a complete color specification.
              Any bit depth other than 1, 2, 4, 8 or 24 is an error
              (see note #1).

16            Grayscale. If this chunk is present and the bit depth
              is 1, 2, 4 or 8, no palette chunk will follow, and
              the bitmap should be interpreted as a linear grayscale,
              where 0 is considered black and (2^bitdepth)-1 is
              considered white. If the bit depth is 24, then this
              chunk should not appear and should be regarded as
              an error if it does (the progam may of course
              warn the user and display the image anyway).

24            Palette 
              This chunk appears only for 1, 2, 4, and 8-bit depths,
              and only when the grayscale chunk does not appear. 
              The number of entries in the palette will not exceed
              2^bitdepth, and may be smaller than that value.
              (Determine the size of the palette by dividing
              the chunk length by 3.) This chunk consists of
              a series of RGB values, consisting of a red byte
              (0 represents no red, 255 represents full red),
              a green byte, and a blue byte for each entry.
              For optimum compression, colors which are
              similar should have adjacent palette values,
              but this is not a requirement for compliance
              with the PBF standard. Any value beyond the
              highest index the palette which appears in the
              bitmap data is an error.

32            Interlace
              When this chunk is present, the image data will
              be interlaced. This means that rows will be stored
              in the following order:     

              Every eighth row, then every eighth row + 4, 
              +2, + 6, + 1, + 3, + 5 and + 7.

              For example, if the image contains 23 rows, they
              will be stored in the following order (considering
              the first row to be row 0 and the last row to
              be row 22):
              0 8 16  4 12 20  2 10 18  6 14 22  1 9 17
              3 11 19  5 13 21  7 15

              The purpose of this feature is to allow images
              to "fade in" in a simple fashion that does
              minimal damage to compression efficiency
              (there is some loss of compression
              efficiency, however).

48            Transparency. (Note that this chunk is necessary;
              without understanding it, your program will fail
              to read truecolor images with alpha channels!)

              FOR PALETTE AND GRAYSCALE IMAGES:
              The chunk data consists of a
              1-byte index into the palette for palette-color
              images, or the 1-byte grayscale level to be
              regarded as transparent for grayscale images.

              FOR 24-BIT TRUECOLOR IMAGES:
              No chunk data (length 0). The presence of this    
              chunk indicates that the image data will include
              an alpha channel in addition to the red, green
              and blue channels. Note that this chunk is
              necessary, since it affects the encoding of
              the truecolor data.

73            Copyright notice. The notice will consist of
              ASCII text and will not be null-terminated.
              New lines should be denoted by a single
              line feed (ascii 10 decimal).

89            Comment. The comment will consist of
              ASCII text and will not be null-terminated.
              New lines should be denoted by a single
              line feed (ascii 10 decimal).

16384         Uncompressed image data 
              (This chunk is intended for use only in applications
              which require high image-reading speed and in which
              communications is NOT a factor.) 

              The chunk data consists of the pixel data for the
              image. 

              PALETTE AND GRAYSCALE IMAGES (bitdepths 1, 2, 4, and 8) 

              For 1-bit palette or grayscale images,
              each horizontal line of pixels is represented
              by a stream of bits, in which bit 7 (128) is the
              leftmost pixel in the byte and bit 0 (1) is the
              rightmost. CONSECUTIVE LINES NEVER SHARE A BYTE.
              That is, if the last pixel of the line falls
              in bit 4 of a byte, the first pixel of the next
              line is stored in bit 7 of the next byte, NOT
              in bit 3 of the same byte. The pixel value
              is an index into the palette, unless the
              grayscale chunk is present. 

              NOTE: rows appear consecutively from the top row
              unless the interlace chunk is present; see the discussion 
              of the interlace chunk for more information about the
              order of interlaced rows. You must be able
              to understand interlaced images to comply with the 
              specification, and the scheme is simple.

              For 2-bit palette or grayscale images,
              the same scheme is followed, except that
              each pixel is represented by a 2-bit portion
              of a byte, with the leftmost bit being most
              significant. For instance, the first pixel
              of the line is represented by bits 7 (128) and 
              6 (64) of the byte. Again, consecutive lines
              do NOT share bytes (see the description of
              1-bit images, and note the possibility
              of interlacing).
        
              For 4-bit palette or grayscale images,
              the same scheme is followed, except that
              each pixel is represented by a 4-bit portion
              of a byte, with the leftmost bit being most
              significant. For instance, the first pixel
              of the line is represented by bits 7 (128),
              6 (64), 5 (32) and 4 (16) of the byte. Again, 
              consecutive lines do NOT share bytes (see the 
              description of 1-bit images, and note the
              possibility of interlacing).

              For 8-bit palette or grayscale images,
              each pixel is represented by a single byte.
              (Note the possibility of interlacing and
              its effect on the order of lines.)

              TRUECOLOR IMAGES (bitdepth 24)

              For truecolor images, each row is represented
              by either three or four rows of bytes,
              depending on the presence or absence of the
              transparency chunk.

              For example, if the image is 80 pixels across,
              the first (top) row consists of:

              80 consecutive bytes representing the red values for each pixel
              80 consecutive bytes representing the green values for each pixel
              80 consecutive bytes representing the blue values for each pixel

              And, if the transparency chunk is present,

              80 consecutive bytes representing the alpha channel values
              for each pixel (see below)

              Rows appear consecutively beginning from the top row,
              unless the interlace chunk is present (see the description
              of the interlace chunk).
             
              How and When to Interpret the Alpha Channel

              Standalone image viewers can ignore the alpha channel,
              provided that they properly skip over it in order to
              be in the right position to read the next row.

              World Wide Web browsers and the like should regard any pixel 
              with an alpha channel value of zero as transparent (the pixel
              should be given the background color of the browser), and
              any pixel with an alpha channel value greater than zero
              as non-transparent.

              Applications which display several images overlaid with
              one another should interpret the pixel with the highest
              alpha channel value as being in front and display that value
              in preference to the others. Note that PBF does not
              specify overlays within the format, in order to ensure
              that streaming, interlaced display remains possible.
              See note #2 for a suggested HTML syntax.

16400         inflate/deflate-compressed image data

              The compressed image chunk takes advantage of the
              inflate/deflate compression employed in the
              widely known gzip software. Extensive legal
              research has been done to support the belief
              that gzip compression is safe with regard to patents.
              inflate/deflate derives from LZ77. deflate can
              be performed in a streaming manner without
              the need to buffer up a significant quantity
              of data.

              Prior to compression, and following decompression,
              the data is formatted exactly as specified for
              the uncompressed image data chunk (see above),
              except for truecolor images (see below).

              EXCEPTION: truecolor (24 bitdepth) images are
              formatted as follows in order to facilitate
              effective compression:
 
              Each byte for a particular color element (or for
              the alpha channel) of a particular pixel is a SIGNED byte
              storing the difference between itself and the previous
              pixel, where the the previous pixel is initially 
              considered to have had the value zero. If the byte 
              contains the value -128 or +127, then THE NEXT BYTE 
              MUST ALSO BE ADDED to compute the value for that pixel,
              and so on (in rare cases this could be needed twice
              to represent one pixel).

              This allows sharp transitions such as that from 0 to 255,
              which would be represented by the byte sequence
              127 127 1.
            
              In the great majority of truecolor images, such
              transitions are rare, and a single byte will suffice
              for most pixels.

              As a result, the number of uncompressed bytes
              used to represent the red portion of the first line
              of an 80-pixel-wide image will be at least
              80 pixels, but probably slightly larger.

              WHY IS THIS SCHEME USED?

              Because, by storing the differences between pixels
              and not the pixels themselves, we give the deflate compression
              algorithm the opportunity to do a much better job.

              IMPORTANT: at the beginning of each band (red, green,
              blue or alpha channel), the previous pixel value is considered
              to be the last pixel value of the previously stored line for THAT
              BAND (zero for the first row). 

              WON'T COMPRESSION LOSE EFFICIENCY WHEN SEPARATE BANDS
              ARE FED TO IT IN A SINGLE STREAM?

              Yes, although no more so than for interlaced images.
              I am still examining this issue.

Notes

#1:

Odd bit depths do not compress well; the savings associated with them 
are largely illusory. Palettes larger than 8 bits begin to overwhelm
the image data size itself. 16-bit truecolor just doesn't look good,
and 24-bit truecolor can easily be used to represent it.

#2:

For the World Wide Web and similar environments, I suggest the following 
extended HTML syntax: 

<IMG SRC="image1.pbf" SRC="image2.pbf">

to display two overlaid images, taking advantage of the alpha channel
to determine what is in front at a given pixel. Due to the caching
capabilities of web browsers, this scheme could be terrific for
the display of often-changing, simple graphs (financial, scientific,...)  
on top of rarely-changing, complex backgrounds. Keeping overlays
out of the PBF format itself saves the grief of downloading an
often-used background over and over.

Certainly implies that Unisys expects commertial Web

No.  At least, that is not what Unisys claims.  Unisys asserts that their 
patent covers decompression (I assume that's what you meant to write.) I 
was told this directly by Oliver Picher, spokesperson for Unisys on the 
LZW issue.

Now, they may be wrong, or not telling the truth, or hoping that nobody 
challenges them.  But they do assert that decompression is covered.

I would very much like to put SSL in the WN server unfortunately it
requires a license from RSA.  There is no way to pay them money
and still make a free server.  

This problem does not occur with MD5.  Here is an excerpt from the
copyright notice:

    that such works are identified as "derived from the RSA Data

Have a look at http://www.npr.gov/OpenMeet/openmeet.html

for one that uses typed links, persistent objects...... ie bit more than a cgi
script.

Collaboration is going to be a big deal and drive some major advances in WWW
this year.

Yup (as confirmed by a later mail).  

Needless to say, I'm not the one working on SSL so I guess I 
should just learn to keep my mouth shut...:^)  I saw RSA and
assumed that it was simply another encryption method.

CNIDR Announces Isite v1.00 Integrated Information System
---------------------------------------------------------

CNIDR is pleased to announce the availability of an integrated information
system that provides several of the tools you need to make your data
searchable over the internet via a variety of standard access protocols
and without being limited to a particular database system. 

CNIDR Isite:

- Supports multiple internet access points to your data via popular
  internationally recognized open communications standards: 

	- Z39.50 (accessible using clients such as Willow, available from Univ.
                  of Washington)
	- HTTP (via our gateway software, which provides forms-based access to
                users with WWW clients such as NCSA Mosaic)
	- E-mail

- Includes a prototype of the new CNIDR Search API, which will allow easy
  customization to support generalized access to database software you are
  already familiar with.  We are currently working to interface this API
  with several popular commercial and freely-available database systems. 

- Includes a new release of CNIDR ZDist, version 1.02, our Z39.50-v2
  protocol client/server/library. 

	- Completely rewritten for improved efficiency and expandability.
	- Support added for forking daemon operation, including load balancing
          capability.
	- Tested for interoperability with other widely used Z39.50 systems.
	- Integrated with CNIDR Search API.

- Includes CNIDR Isearch, our own data search/retrieval system:

	- "Iindex" and "Isearch" command-line utilities for building and
	  searching text databases.
	- Fast searching with relevance-ranked results.
	- Indexing/searching engine core is designed as an object-oriented C++
	  class library to allow you to build fast text searching capabilities
	  into your own applications.
	- Integrated with CNIDR Search API.


HOW TO GET CNIDR ISITE
----------------------

CNIDR Isite is available via anonymous ftp at

	<URL:ftp://ftp.cnidr.org/pub/NIDR.tools/Isite/Isite-1.00.tar.gz>

Pre-compiled binaries for some platforms will be found in the same
directory (for those that do not have g++).  More binaries will be
available over time.  Isearch binaries can be found under
/pub/NIDR.tools/Isearch/. 


HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE ISITE MAILING LIST
------------------------------------------

A mailing list has been set up for discussion of this system.  To 
subscribe, send a message to

	listserv@vinca.cnidr.org

with the body of the message being

	subscribe ISITE-L Your Name

To post messages to the list, send them to

The URI working group proposed a "nntp:" URL instead of "news:" for
specific NTTP access to a particular host.

There is no reason that news://host/group can't work, in fact it
does in some browser implementations.  Is there any reason that the URI
working group choose to come up with a new URL prefix?

It's been a while, but I think it was a matter of keeping things
separate. "news:" could be implemented by any protocol at all, and
isn't tied to NNTP. However, once you start specifying a host and a
port, you really have to say what protocol you mean, too.

Is there any way in HTTP for a Server to automatically update a page
without requiring the user of the client to click on anything?

An example use of this would be if a Client requests a stock price
page and keeps the page displayed.  Now suppose the stock price
changes.  Is there a way within HTTP for the Server to update the page
automatically without requiring the user to click on the reload option?

Thank-you.

Another advantage is that the user could enter their password at the client
for this session.  The client stores it in memory (hopefully will never

Everytime the user logs into a new WWW server the authentication could take

The big drawbacks are a) keeping a database up to date on all of those
servers would be horrible and b) just like any other WWW implementation of
authentication, each connection would be authenticated, each little
picture, each set of text.  Since the idea is to make it invisible to the
user, the user would not have to enter X number of S/Key responces, but the
client server interaction would be slowed down significantly by the MD4
calculations that need to be done, and the packet exchange for each WWW
connection.

Folks, if you actually read what was written, Unisys is enforcing their 
patent.  Compuserve happened to use Unisys technology in GIF.  If you're 
going to configure your browser to not accept connections, Compuserve 
isn't the right target.

On the other hand, you've probably never paid any money to Unisys, have you.

The HTTP documentation mentions the Expires: header which "Gives the date
after which the information ceases to be valid and should be retrieved
again" to "allow for the periodic refreshing of displays of volitile
data". 

Some clients are now starting to support the Expires header, but I know of
none that will automatically refresh without user intervention.  If they
do then there is a need for a second header: one that tells the client
that the document will expire at some given time - but don't bother
getting it again.

Conferencing, however it is implemented, requires some form of active
notification of interested participants when something has changed so
they can avoid repeated polling of servers to find out.  Email works
fine for this purpose until the number of participants gets large
enough to justify flooded distribution to the world as in nntp news.

WWW based conferencing is interesting because it may use multimedia, and
because it is built around the archive rather than building the archive
after the fact.

Hi folks,

sorry about the multiple lists business, but this has leaked across 
boundaries...


The Spyglass scheme is pretty much the same as the one I proposed in Shen with
minor modifications. I did use the S-Key scheme initially but decided against it 
and now use a slightly different form. I have been reimplementing it as part of 
the process of implementing S-HTTP, If people like I can try to get some code 
out by the end of the Week - no the beginning of the next week. It is written 
but not completely tested, runs on the CERN server and on the Linemode browser.

We should be discussing this on the security list BTW... 

>>>> MAILTO:www-security-request@ns1.rutgers.edu


I think we need to separate levels of abstraction here, first there is the idea
of using an MD5 hash, second there is the implementation idiom. On the 
implementation idiom the winner is Alan Shifman of EIT, both he and I suggested 
implementation idioms for security in HTTP. Without wanting to reopen that 
debate it turns out that Alan picked the right solution, I had tried as far as 
possible to stay within certain constraints set by HTTP, Alan decided to work 
with a bit more freedom. Judging the results I don't think that keeping the 
restrictions is worth the candle, the advantage gained is illusory it turns out.


Really we should not be talking about S-HTTP anymore, it is really HTTP/2.0 or
something, except that there are some changes that I would like to see in the 
negotiation mechanism to make it a general one. Really S-HTTP as a name is an 
abreviation for "Security ideas form EIT".

One other point, the scheme can also be used to do encryption without involving 
RSA. If the password has got to the other end OK then it can be used as a 
symmetric encryption key.


OK now for the technical issue, S-Key vs Digest method?

1) Common Definitions, 

Let D(x) be a digest function
Let P be the known password.


2) S-Key,

Parameters: Let n be an integer.

Initialisation: 

Server calculates test value T = D^n(P) and stores it together with a count, C 
which is initialised to 0

Client, stores value of count, 0.


Application: Client cacluates K=D^(n-C)(P), Server calculates D^C(K) which 
should match T. C is incremented, if C>P a new password is needed.


3) Digest,

Server calculates diest of password, DP = D(P)
Client - no calculation.

To send a message, M the value K = D(M, DP) is calculated. The server matches 
this with the password in the database. 



Comparison,

S-Key Advantages,

No password is stored in plaintext.
Password is never communicated in the clear.
It is actually used in some dongle type systems (ask TIS!)

S-Key Disadvantages

The mechanism is not idempotent, this is a big problem when a forking server is 
used (eg the CERN one). Under UNIX there is no method of reliably updating the 
password database with the new value of the count. With threads this is not the 
case. Implementation of this scheme would require a major rewrite of the CERN 
server and many others. This being the case I'm not too happy with using it for 
a `simple' scheme.

The mechanism also breaks down if several requests are generated and handled in 
a different order. Eg Netscape server toasting mode when loading multiple gif 
files at once. This problem also occurs in normal usage - eg have a query on a 
server that is taking some time and pop a few extra requests in at the same 
time.

Communicating the original password is a problem.

Possible problem with certain faulty hash functions. Repeated recursive 
application may turn up some sort of locus of attraction problem meaning that 
D^n(X) = D^n(Y) with a frequency dependent on n. This sort of thing is unlikely 
to occur in the range suggested by Lamport (100 ish) but I would be worried, 
particularly with MD5 for reasons I go into later.

The original scheme was designed for login type applications. HTTP works at the 
request level so there are many more communications - thousands a day in fact, 
each time I read an email I am generating a new HTTP transaction (hands off - 
not finished yet BTW).


Digest Advantages,

Password is never communicated in the clear.

Digest Disadvantages

The user password is not stored in plaintext but the digest of the pasword DP is 
all that is actually required. This may seem a major hole but the same risk is 
actually present with public key schemes where an authentication signature is 
stored in the machine itself.

Communicating the original password is a problem. As with S-Key there is still 
an advantage to using RSA etc.


Modifications,
--------------

Actually both schemes should be slightly modified in the following manner, 
instead of using the password P it is better to use a composite of the Password, 
username and server to form the Digest root.



Proposal,
---------

First off MD5 is not such a good hash function, problems with the compressor. 
SHA is much better for this purpose. Main point is it must be selectable which 
means that S-HTTP type negotiation is a factor.

Incorporate an S-Key mode into S-HTTP. I am quite happy to do client side 
implementation and server side hooks but as previously stated I can;t do a 
usefull scheme with the CERN server if its going to be forking. Even without 
forking it would be a major hassle for many other implementors. Actually there 
is a major hassle for some clients as well (not Arena or the linemode.

To do this the easiest mode would be to simply integrate it as a variant of the 
current digest scheme.

Nope, MD5 is a public domain algorithm, RSA put it there. so long as it is 
refered to as the RSA blah de blah. Originally the code was non-commercial use
only but i think that is now changed as well - not that it would be a problem.


In any case MD5 is not the best hash to use SHA is better. Main thing to avoid
is MD4 though which is seriously compromised.

Doing caches to a local server, which might also store your authenticated 
preferences and postings, might be the model.  I'm using the Harvest 
system, which can regularly go out and sniff around for indexing.

And for the little-used HEAD directive.  Alas, more info should be 
configured into the server and into docs (META).

  Because its quick, lite-weight, and doesn't require a license from RSA.

  Nope, nothing says that SSL and SHTTP can't be implemented using RSAREF,
the free version of TIPEM, and K5 is fairly easy to implement.  SHTTP and
SSL will both be in the emacs-w3 browser within a few months (weeks ?:)

  The MD5 algorithm does _NOT_ require a license from RSA.  This is from
the md5-announcement.txt that came with the MD5 source I use in emacs:

---- begin excerpt
		 MD5 -- New Message Digest Algorithm
		  (Feel free to distribute further)

RSA Data Security is announcing MD5, a new message-digest algorithm.
Like MD4, this algorithm is being placed in the public domain for free
general use.

The MD5 algorithm is a strengthened version of MD4.  It has four
rounds instead of three, and incorporates other revisions based on a
year's worth of collected comments on the MD4 algorithm.  For example,
the input access patterns in rounds two and three have been improved,
and the rotation amounts have been optimized for maximum ``avalanche
effect.''  The additive constants have been made unique in each step,
and an additional dependence of each step on the previous one has been
added.

---- end excerpt

  Also, from all the headers in the source code:

---- begin excerpt
License to copy and use this software is granted provided that it
is identified as the "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest
Algorithm" in all material mentioning or referencing this software
or this function.

License is also granted to make and use derivative works provided
that such works are identified as "derived from the RSA Data
Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" in all material
mentioning or referencing the derived work.

---- end excerpt

  No special-casing of free vs. commercial in there.  Note 'public domain'
also.

CCI supported by NCSA Mosaic 2.5b says something about "Slide Show."
I have not tried yet, but is this function relevant with your question?

This is fine for the whole page but in some instances only a part of a
page is likely to require an update (specifically - for my work -
camera images from remote sites).

Would it not be possible to attach an expire attribute to individual
parts of a page ? (getting more and more like individual information
objects making up a page !)

I like the idea of the flexability of TIFF....I never realized it was so 
useful....

Maybe I will change my vote for TIFF :)

<A HREF="ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/nmh">S/Key Source</a>

I also have a hardcopy of a white paper from Neil M. Haller at Bellcore that
describes S/Key.  It is clever and worthy of consideration.  It may be
available electronically at the above site somewhere.

One problem with this and the Spyglass schemes is that the password must
be passed once via some other means, and, in the case of S/Key, each time the
password expires.  S/Key seems to have been designed to solve the problem
of the remote person who wishes to login to a home site over
questionable comm links, but otherwise has some secure means of setting
and changing passwords at the home facility.

Wel actually there is a good use for the symettic and digest key schemes in any
system, RSA is very slow, far too slow for use on every single transaction. 
That is why Alan and myself have both got schemes to minimise the number of 
RSA operations.

RSAref cannot be used to implement SSL and may not allow S-HTTP to be done in 
its entirety, the problem is that in RSAref you do not have functions 
RSA-encrypt(x) and DES-encrypt(x) but have them lumped together as
RSA-encrypt(DES-encrypt(x)), well thats not quite what the problem is but 
it gives you the idea, RSAref is not an all singing and dancing object, there
are some carefully thought out gotchas to stop you using it for certain
purposes. This may be different in RSAref3 should it exist. I have only RSAref2,
living as I do in the free world.

SSL uses RC4 which is "secret" anyone wanting a copy can get one from a site in 
Italy however :-)


Another point is that we really do need an exportable authentication scheme.
Even if it is of limited security. Actually Public key does not provide more 
security at the theoretic level, its just easier to provide security in 
practical situations.

I believe Netscape for X allows some sort of video/audio reception; but 
since their site is completely unreachable this morning, I can't work 
from anything but memory.  That's a pretty specific solution to the 
problem, in any case: only works if everyone is using one particular 
browser/windowing setup.

Then again, this isn't TV -- maybe refreshing the page while the user 
just sits there isn't such a great direction to take.

Currently no.  HTTP is connectionless, and that makes it hard to
do things after a transaction is completed.

Another way to do this is to provide a stock-ticker application that
is initialized by the web client when it receives application/x-stock-ticker
data.  The browser forks off the special viewer which opens a separate
communication channel to the server.

The previously noted use of Expires: xxx header is interesting - I don't 
think it will work in the described manner until after a few revisions
of browser software have passed...

Recently, we proposed a simple authentication scheme, based on the MD5
algorithm, for possible inclusion in the discussed HTTP/1.1.

It has been suggested by Phillip Hallam-Baker that the scheme should
not use MD5, due to a known weakness.  He is suggesting the use of SHA
instead.  We would like to generate discussion on this, so that we can
move quickly toward consensus.

The choice need not be a difficult one.  This simple access
authentication scheme is not intended to be a solution to the entire
web-security need.  What we seek is a simple, but relatively secure
replacement for the Basic Access Authentication scheme in HTTP/1.0.

We chose MD5 primarily because code is widely available, in the belief
that it was strong enough for our target usage.  However, if there is
consensus that SHA would be an all-around better choice, we will revise
our proposal.

It is our intention to make source code for our scheme available as we
can do so.  Some software developers have already expressed enthusiasm
for helping with prototype implementations of the scheme.

The current draft of our proposal is located at:

>	TIFF is good

As we have a jukebox chock full of TIFF page images, we had to integrate
libtiff into mosaic (< v2.5) last year to provide the content locally.
It requires perhaps an additional 15 lines of code for two .c files (as
well as linking in libtiff.a).

Question:

I know of no client that will automatically refetch a document (if it is the
current on the screen) if the current time surpasses the Expire time specified
for the document. Correct?

From:
http://www11.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/HTTP1.0-ID_37.html#HEADING97

Note
This field can also be used for automatic refreshing of dynamic or volatile
data. However, this is completely dependent on the implementation of the client
application to automatically issue a new request when the object has expired.

Object's generated by data-producing processes, or scripts which can be run by
such processes, are often dynamic by nature. Therefore, it is strongly
recommended that responses containing such Objects's contain an Expires header
field.

For active documents that change when the stock price changes or
involve a conference between multiple participants, I like the idea of
extending "expires:" to be (point to) an expression, the variables of
which can include things like 'the current time' or 'the location of
the browser' (for mobile applications) or other items which have a
URN. The resolution strategy for dynamic variables is that you get the
URN, you decide if this is a local one (i.e., that you get from your
environment, in which case you watch it locally) or a remote one (in
which case you have to resolve the URN into something that you can
watch, e.g., the time, which means that you poll.)

This scheme evolves gracefully: dumb clients can always poll, smart
ones can know more about two-way communication between their
environment watcher and the servers that control those state
variables.

(This is a variation of the idea in <URL:http://www.cs.washington.edu/

I would think another method of doing this would be a configurable option
in the browser indicating how frequently (in minutes?) it should reload the
current document.  The default setting would be "never" or "zero", of
course.  This wouldn't require anything from HTTP.

Is there a public domain code library for a WWW client in Perl? I'm running
it on a Mac, so MacPerl code is great, but anything will be appreciated.

Thanks,

<mogens@CS.Stanford.EDU>
|Currently no.  HTTP is connectionless, and that makes it hard to
|do things after a transaction is completed.

Except perform another transaction :)

The problem is that the data change on the server side and there is no
way in the current HTTP model for the server to contact a client to
inform them of this.

A solution that would be within the http model would be for the server to
inform the client that the content of this document changes rapidly and a
interval for refreshed.  Something like:

C: GET /stock_quote.html HTTP/1.1
S: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-type: text/html
-->Refresh: <time_interval>
   Last-modified: Wednesday, 07-Dec-94 22:03:38 GMT
   Expires: Wednesday, 07-Dec-94 22:03:39 GMT
   Content-length: 1721

This would allow the client to set a timer and perform a GET on the URL
every time_interval so you would have the perception of a dynamically
updated document.  The updates would be dependent on the alarm clock, of
course, instead of any real change in the content of the document, but I
think its the closest you are going to get under the current scheme.

I'm posting this question in the hope of finding a few WebServers in the
Montral, Canada region. The reason of this relates to my studies. In the 
context of a research, I would like to discuss, meet and possibly visit a
web site. The information needed is not yet clearly defined, but I would appreciate personnal postings informing me of your existence. When the needed information is then better defined, we could discuss your interest in participating.
This information should be better known by the end of January which is why I'm posting this today.

You may reach me at the following E-Mail address: K386@HEC.CA.

Isn't it fun, trying to introduce advanced concepts of state to a 
stateless protocol.

Is http going to keep mutating to provide the things people need, or is 
state going to be obtained some other way?

libwww-perl :  <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/>

It will require some changes to run with MacPerl (MacPerl lacks some of
the common unix system routines).  Ask Kevin Altis <altis@city.net> about
that.

In my reading of various HTML docs I haven't noticed (or understood)
how to have the user send a file (e.g. of text, image or audio) to a
script on the server.  What I want is a way to have an "attach" button
in the document.  When the button is pressed, the client would query
the user for filename(s).  When the "submit" button is pressed the
file(s) would be attached (MIME-style) to what the client ships off to
the server.  The server would then return something based on an
"analysis" of what the user sent.

This seems a rather obvious need, so I'm hopefull I've missed
something; please enlighten me.

I just got a request from some publisher to distribute www_and_frame
with their book. I don't think that would be a good idea. That package
was something of a hack back in '92 when I wrote it, and I can't
believe anybody could make productive use of it today.

I still get quite a few "I can't get it to work... can you help?"
messages about this thing, but as far as I know, I've never actually
helped anybody get it working.

So I'll ask here: is anybody actually using www_and_frame?

Is everybody using Webmaker?

Does Frame Technology sell a solution to this problem?

Unless I hear that www_and_frame actually serves some useful purpose,
I'm going to tell the publisher no thanks.

I use Webmaker. What else is there? ;) Oh well, some people prefer fm2html.

Not that I know of, but they have a website up: http://www.frame.com

I am trying out the .multi feature in CERN's 3.0
server. I read the docs, and some parts seems to work,
however when it comes to ranking, it does not do the
right thing. Is this pilot error? any advice, clues?

thanks in advance,

Hello,

I am interested in implementing a batched HTTP transfer scheme.
We are building a local dialup network running on UUCP/Fidotech, with
only one node hooked up to the Internet, hitching on a university.
I'd like to have a way by which once a day, a robot on the IP node
(the WWW line browser, perhaps?) gets updates of certain WWW sites.
Or better yet, if it could somehow be informed by the site that a 
change has taken place.  Then, the web page, along with its local (on
the same site) cross-references, would be taken.

I was then thinking that this data would be encapsulated in a mail
message, or even a local USENET group, for easier distribution, with
appropriate MIME encapsulation of the pictures/sounds/binary data.
A decoder on the sites which will receive this would then transform it
back to the original page, except that of course the URLs that point
to things outside of the current batch would not be accessible.

Anyone have ideas on what software to use?  Has anyone done this
already?  Is it feasible at all?  It would be great since IP connectivity
is scarce in these parts.

Thank you, all!

I believe there has been an Internet-Draft written on this very topic
by Larry Masinter and Ernesto Nebel, "Form-based File Upload in HTML",
<draft-ietf-html-fileupload-01.txt>.

It specifies the ability to upload files using a form based mark-up,
it also includes the MIME encoding.  They have an example
implementation for Mosaic, the code is accessible at
URL:ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/transient/file-upload/

  "To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please check the
  ``1id-abstracts.txt'' listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow
  Directories on ftp.is.co.za (Africa), nic.nordu.net (Europe),
  munnari.oz.au (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US East Coast), or
  ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast)."

Hope this helps...

Well, there are certainly many starting points.
For example, take a look at:

http://groucho.gsfc.nasa.gov/Code_520/locator/locator.html
The WWW Locator Guide

which is a meta reference.

No.  I use MifMucker (since I know the author :-).

In a round-about-way, yes.  Frame has the SGML work bench for
FrameBuilder.  It is supposed to let you translate between builder and
SGML.  I haven't had time to play with it.  To my knowledge, Frame
does not have anything for FrameMaker.

If you have no intent to support it, I'd tell them no.  If www_and_frame
is distributed with the book, all you will get is more e-mail
on "How do I get it to work?"

Well, your first stop should be CERN's intro to the WWW at:

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

This will give you a history of the Web, it's original intent, etc.

You should next look at the WWW FAQ. It's posted every four days to 
comp.infosystems.www.users, comp.infosystems.www.providers, 
comp.infosystems.www.misc and alt.hypertext.

You can get an ASCII text version of the FAQ via ftp from:

rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/www/faq

The latest version of the FAQ is on the Web at:

http://siva.cshl.org/~boutell/www_faq.html

The FAQ will give you pointers to the HTML Primer, the Beginner's Guide 
to HTML and to more in-depth sources.

You might also want to check out a paper prepared by Kevin Hughes: 
"Entering the World Wide Web: A Guide to Cyberspace". It's available as 
a .ps, .tar, .txt and .zip file. It's available via ftp at:

ftp.eit.com/pub/web.guide/guide.61/

Hope this helps and enjoy!

Regards,

Cecilia

Before this goes much further I recommend people *read* :-)

	http://www.unisys.com/LeadStory/lzwinfo.html

for information on Unisys's attitude to the use of LZW, along with

	http://www.compuserve.com/isd/news_rel/gif.html

for Compuserve's response to the new licencing deal.

As I read it Compuserve will only be charging *commercial*developers* of
programs which use GIF images whose programs are written after Jan 31st
1995. According their press release "CompuServe will not profit from
this service".

There is no general charge for storing GIFs or pulling them down from
other sites. This whole deal has been massively overhyped and there is a
lot of misinformation going around.

[BTW this in no way implies that I approve of Unisys's patenting of LZW
and the way they and Compuserve have handled the GIF issue. I also think
the development of a public domain GIF alternative could well be a good
idea]

Oh yes, for those proposing JPEG as an alternative --- I'm fairly sure
that IBM holds patents on the compression algorithms used :-)

Would some kind soul please post this alleged "announcement"? So far I have 
only heard about this through "third"-parties.

We have a searcher agent for general Web beginner information at
<URL:http://www.verity.com:8089/?exiturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verity.com%2Fvlibs
earch.html&qparser=simple&query=www-FAQ-list>.

We also have a subset of that agent, specifically about set-up and
configuration information, at
<URL:http://www.verity.com:8089/?exiturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verity.com%2Fvlibs
earch.html&qparser=simple&query=set-up-FAQs>.

Contrary to what the names of the agents might suggest, they search much
more than just FAQ lists; they search our entire Verity Virtual Library.

By the way, today we added a number of e-mail lists to the Library,
including www-proxy, www-rdb, and others.  We're also expanding the number
of Web sites... and we should have Usenet included within a few days.

You can broaden the agents' searches with additional words, separated from
their names by commas, or you can narrow the search using "and" but you
need to escape spaces and angle brackets... e.g., to search for setup
information about servers, you'd use
<URL:http://www.verity.com:8089/?exiturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verity.com%2Fvlibs
earch.html&qparser=simple&query=set-up-faqs+%3Cand%3E+server>.

You can enter searcher agent names and additional queries from a generic
search screen at <URL:http://www.verity.com/vlibsearch.html>... saving all
of the escaping and such.  On that screen, you'd use "www-FAQ-list <and>
server" for the query above.

The indexes are being updated somewhat irregularly at present, while we
bring everything up.  Shortly, they'll be on a schedule that'll update
Usenet in real-time (that would be *our* feed's real-time; yours may vary),
the mailing lists every night, and the Web sites a maximum of every 7 days.

The mailing lists can be browsed any time; the time lag for them is usually
no more than an hour or two.  (BTW, there's a known bug with properly cited
URLs, as I have them in this very message -- the text-to-hypertext
conversion includes the trailing angle bracket.  This will be fixed soon.)

The home page for the Verity Virtual Library is
<URL:http://www.verity.com/library.html>.

Eric from Spyglass posted to www-talk a proposal for using MD5 encryption 
in a system like this a few weeks ago - it looked solid, and I'm waiting 
for a server and a browser to implement it (WN and Arena maybe?) so I can 
set it up for HotWired.

don't see that as a huge issue.  However the above statement implies that a 
server can negotiate which type of authentication can be used:

S: Here's a challenge.  Encrypt it.
C: Huh?  
S: oh, nevermind.  Send me your uuencoded password.
C: okay, here goes....

..which doesn't seem to be in the specs anywhere.  I'd prefer not to 
have two separate URL's for different authentication schemes, though I 
could hack around that by keeping around a list of browsers implementing 
challenge-response.

Conferencing, however it is implemented, requires some form of active
notification of interested participants when something has changed so
they can avoid repeated polling of servers to find out.  Email works
fine for this purpose until the number of participants gets large
enough to justify flooded distribution to the world as in nntp news.

WWW based conferencing is interesting because it may use multimedia, and
because it is built around the archive rather than building the archive
after the fact.

I'm glad there is a simple URL option for the entry point.  The chance
of a beginner searching the FAQ using the two-line URL above is, I
imagine quite remote...  at this stage in Web development, there is
still a need for URLs to be human-readable and human-understandable.

Would it not be possible to advertise some simple URLs, on  the default port,
for example http://www.verity.com/beginner that generate a 302 moved 
temporarily redirect (so the client continues to use the original URL)
to the full gobbledegook on port 8089 ?

Incidentally, I note that the server on port 8089 does not support HEAD -
it does a GET (and, in this example, returns a document somewhat past 
it's sell by date ;-)

  cguhpc [54]: telnet www.verity.com 8089
  Trying...
  Connected to ftp.verity.com.
  Escape character is '^]'.

Is this intentional behaviour? And why no Server: field? Optional, I know, 
but recommended.

I wanted to summarize the information/comments I've received so far regarding
a question I posted a few days ago.  It was suggested that I should
do this for newcomers or anyone who might have missed part of the thread.
The question I posted was:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is there any way in HTTP for a Server to automatically update a page
without requiring the user of the client to click on anything?

An example use of this would be if a Client requests a stock price
page and keeps the page displayed.  Now suppose the stock price
changes.  Is there a way within HTTP for the Server to update the page
automatically without requiring the user to click on the reload option?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic answer so far is that the Expires Object Header field (see section
7.7 of the HTTP/1.0 document) could potentially be used for this purpose,
but that any client which supports the Expires header field would probably
only update the page when the user clicked on the "forward" or "back" button 
on a browser.

If a client did continually request a page as its expiration time arrived
(perhaps every few seconds), this could handle the case where the
client should get continuous updates.  But there are cases where a page
is valid only once -- they expire immediately and the client shouldn't
get them again.  The example cited in this context by Mark J. Cox
(M.J.Cox@bradford.ac.uk) was "a page which tells you that the
phone link to our remote telescope has been established -- this document
expires immediately but I don't want the document to reload forever".
Mark's position therefore, was that if a client did automatically refresh
a page without user intervention, "then there is a need for a second header:
one that tells the client that the document will expire at some given time -
but don't bother getting it again."
  
Christian Mogensen (<mogens@CS.Stanford.EDU) suggested that "another
way to do this would be to provide a stock-ticker application that
is initialized by the web client when it receives application/x-stock-ticker
data.  The browser forks off the special viewer which opens a separate
communication channel to the server."  

Finally, the support for automatic refresh could not really be completely
Server-driven.  As Mark J. Cox points out "since HTTP follows a single
Request/Responce paradigm it can not be made a function of the Server
(actually it could, but it would also require client modifications and
would be far more complex)."

Are there any additional thoughts on this question?

    Hi, everybody!

I need some little help.
I've got a work in my school. I have to solve a problem in computer 
rooms in my school, because there is about 400 students and only 30 
computers in laboratory. So I have to give to every student a time to 
work on computer. I know there in an Accounting on Novell Server, but 
it is terrible to give a 300 points every Friday afternoon to every 
user of net. I have to make a program type .NLM, which have to be 
active every Friday afternoon and have to give points. You may know 
it is hard to give 300 points to 400 or 500 users of our netware.
Please help me if you know how.

                                        Pacho.

PS: I prefer 1st adress in my signatur.

If people want to enter queries manually, there's a form for that, whose
URL is very simple: <URL:http://www.verity.com/vlibsearch.html>.

Your comments were very helpful.  As a result, I found out that most of the
parameters are optional.  Ah, learning by doing.  Turns out that
<URL:http://www.verity.com:8089/?query=www-FAQ-list> works just fine.

How's that for simple?

We're getting out of the HTTPd business, at least temporarily, in favor of
CGI, precisely so that we don't have to worry about anything other than
search.  We were concerned about CGI performance, since we have customers
who want to handle hundreds of thousands of users, even millions, but it
turns out that there were fairly easy ways to deal with performance.

The reason for the strange behavior you saw is that our search server
doesn't do the basic HTTPd function -- returning documents from the file
system.  It's totally search-oriented.  And going away in favor of CGI.

In our next implementation, we might tightly integrate an HTTPd and our
search engine, but we're saving that decision for later.  In any case, we
don't want to reinvent HTTPd.  We'll surely OEM or buy something.

Because of the other problems that you noted (namely, that clients are not
required to automatically reload a document when it passes the Expired time-
in fact, it would be detrimental to do so), I would propose an 
"Expires-Auto-Update:" field - with a value of "yes" or "no", default "no"
in case of the header line not appearing - which would force the client to
automatically update the page.  If this header line appears and has a value
of "yes", the client would be responsible for updating the data when it
expires, assuming the document is still being displayed.  This would not
break current implementations (excepting that they would not support auto
refresh, but I don't see a way for them to do it anyway), but would allow
a server to tell a client, "here's a document.  Update it when it expires."

Yup.  Because of the stateless (on the server side, at least) paradigm of
HTTP, the client would have to be responsible for automatically refreshing
the data.

The current HTTP draft spec *does* specifically
interpret "Expires:" as a client directive to
automatically reload the data at that time -- i.e. expiry
interpreted as "data expiry".

However, along with Dan Connolly, and others that Bill
Allocca mentions, I also originally interpreted
Expires as a server guarantee to deliver constant data up
to that time -- i.e. expiry interpreted as "URL expiry".

My own example of "URL expiry" without "data expiry" was
that of custom inline images inside FORM-generated
documents, which get deleted from the server
immediately upon retrieval.  According to the HTTP draft
spec, I should not tell the client to "expire" these
images.

> I would propose an "Expires-Auto-Update:" field - with a

Since, "data expiry" and "URL expiry" are independent
issues, as the examples have shown, it seems like we
really need two independent time headers, say
"Data-Expires:" and "URI-Expires:".

According to the current HTTP spec draft, "Expires:" means
"Data-Expires:", and this does seem like the more generally
useful one.

Dear Friends,

While I agree with Chris that this recent move by Unisys is a blow to
the www community, I hesitate to support wholesale refusal of Compu$$
connections.  I am currently in the process of setting up a sub-domain
here and am faced with realizing many users can only gain an on-ramp
through the use of providers like Compu$erve.  If such a move to deny
connections were to be made I would strongly encourage appropriately
posting reasons to Compu$erve forums so that members understand why 
they are being denied the valuable resources of the WWW.  I personally
feel that the solution is to begin immediate support of JPEG and another
lossless compression scheme (like the suggested GNIF).  However, I think
this brings up an interesting point.  How are we able to notify all the
web server admin folks out there that the standards have changed and that
they are now supposed to use another method?  The registration lists are
a good start, but I think this will be an interesting test of how connected
we all really are. :-)  Best of luck to us all!

There are several of these groups.  Try joining one or more of the 
following:

comp.infosystems.www.misc
comp.infosystems.www.providers
comp.infosystems.www.users

There are the ones that my news server has, perhaps yours has them as 
well.

It might be handy if client software contained an option Refresh Current Page
or a Refresh Hotlist, in which the user can set the interval between 
every refresh (the -reload- the browser actually will make).

So that would be server independend. An extra possibillity would be to 
have a keywoard refresh that, if used in a html pagem sets of this 
Refresh option and asks the user automatically if he wants to refresh and 
if so with which interval (add to refresh hotlist?).

With the Refresh Hotlist (or History) a user would be able to pre-define 
the refresh action taken, when getting to a certain page.

Uhm, this is just some 'wild'idea of mine, wonder if it makes sence... :-)


Greetings,

Frans

MD5 technology is very different from the patented public key encyption.
It's just a secure hash function. There are others -- SHS, MD4, etc.

Anyway... the md5 source code is all over the place. There's an md5
module in the Python distribution, so I'm pretty sure there are no
prohobitive licensing restrictions.

The basic difference between those two approaches is where the  
"browsing smarts" reside -- client or server.  The path of your  
explorations suggests some of the pros and cons:

Pros for the server-side approach:  the browsing interface can be  
customized for the topic at hand and, more importantly, it can be  
instantly upgraded without all the distribution problems of ordinary  
software.   (Presumably these reasons attracted you to the server  
approach in the first place.)

Cons:  server-side smarts can be a heavy burden to both server and  
client.  The server must maintain "account" information for large  
numbers of users, even though the majority will make only brief use  
of the system.  And the user has the burden of trying to keep track  
of all the accounts on different servers.

In other words, both pure-client and pure-server approaches have  
serious disadvantages.  What is really needed is a client/server  
balance.

For example, if the amount of "user customization/preference" info is  
not overly large (up to a few 10K), server-side smarts can still be  
made efficient by relying on the client to store the user-specific  
info between sessions.  This can be done conveniently with current  
Web tools by providing users with a log-on page (laced with hidden  
form fields) that they can save on their own machines, and then  
resubmit to start a new session.  This allows the server to only  
maintain short-lived "session" state, rather than long-lived "user"  
state, and so is much more efficient.

Of course, more sophisticated client/server balancing is possible.

Hello, I'm new to this group, and I'd like to know if work has already
been done or is going on on this subject.

The problem is the following: how to convey thru a mailcap file that
the rendering of a given part (an image, like a jpg, a movie, like an
mpg, or the output of an application, like postscript), is to be done
in a sub-window of the browser/mailer, rather than in its own external
viewer toplevel.

In the context of the Web, I'd like to be able to say in my HTML
document:

	<IMG SRC="http://host/path/foo.mpeg">

and have the browser side display that stuff, whatever it is,
*inline*, not in another window.

I don't want the browser to do it itself, I'd like to be able to
configure my mailcap file on the browser side with something like:

	video/mpeg              : mpeg_play_embed %s %E
	application/postscript  : ghostview_embed %s %E

where %E (E for Embedded_info) could be the id of the window (a
browser sub-window) where the rendering is to happen.

I'm not sure if an extension of rfc1524 (mailcap syntax) is needed, or
if a set of conventions would be enough.


There is a whole set of issues wrt embedding in a window system (at
least in X), going from session management (how to tell the embedded
app to go away, to come back, etc) up to geometry negociations, and I
don't want to ignore these, but I think that a generic way to initiate
embedding is needed to start with.

The big drawbacks are a) keeping a database up to date on all of those

authentication, each connection would be authenticated, each little
picture, each set of text.  Since the idea is to make it invisible to the
user, the user would not have to enter X number of S/Key responces, but the
client server interaction would be slowed down significantly by the MD4
calculations that need to be done, and the packet exchange for each WWW
connection.

The HTTP documentation mentions the Expires: header which "Gives the date
after which the information ceases to be valid and should be retrieved
again" to "allow for the periodic refreshing of displays of volitile
data". 

Some clients are now starting to support the Expires header, but I know of
none that will automatically refresh without user intervention.  If they
do then there is a need for a second header: one that tells the client
that the document will expire at some given time - but don't bother
getting it again.

Hi folks,

sorry about the multiple lists business, but this has leaked across 
boundaries...


The Spyglass scheme is pretty much the same as the one I proposed in Shen with
minor modifications. I did use the S-Key scheme initially but decided against it 
and now use a slightly different form. I have been reimplementing it as part of 
the process of implementing S-HTTP, If people like I can try to get some code 
out by the end of the Week - no the beginning of the next week. It is written 
but not completely tested, runs on the CERN server and on the Linemode browser.

We should be discussing this on the security list BTW... 

>>>> MAILTO:www-security-request@ns1.rutgers.edu


I think we need to separate levels of abstraction here, first there is the idea
of using an MD5 hash, second there is the implementation idiom. On the 
implementation idiom the winner is Alan Shifman of EIT, both he and I suggested 
implementation idioms for security in HTTP. Without wanting to reopen that 
debate it turns out that Alan picked the right solution, I had tried as far as 
possible to stay within certain constraints set by HTTP, Alan decided to work 
with a bit more freedom. Judging the results I don't think that keeping the 
restrictions is worth the candle, the advantage gained is illusory it turns out.


Really we should not be talking about S-HTTP anymore, it is really HTTP/2.0 or
something, except that there are some changes that I would like to see in the 
negotiation mechanism to make it a general one. Really S-HTTP as a name is an 
abreviation for "Security ideas form EIT".

One other point, the scheme can also be used to do encryption without involving 
RSA. If the password has got to the other end OK then it can be used as a 
symmetric encryption key.


OK now for the technical issue, S-Key vs Digest method?

1) Common Definitions, 

Let D(x) be a digest function
Let P be the known password.


2) S-Key,

Parameters: Let n be an integer.

Initialisation: 

Server calculates test value T = D^n(P) and stores it together with a count, C 
which is initialised to 0

Client, stores value of count, 0.


Application: Client cacluates K=D^(n-C)(P), Server calculates D^C(K) which 
should match T. C is incremented, if C>P a new password is needed.


3) Digest,

Server calculates diest of password, DP = D(P)
Client - no calculation.

To send a message, M the value K = D(M, DP) is calculated. The server matches 
this with the password in the database. 



Comparison,

S-Key Advantages,

No password is stored in plaintext.
Password is never communicated in the clear.
It is actually used in some dongle type systems (ask TIS!)

S-Key Disadvantages

The mechanism is not idempotent, this is a big problem when a forking server is 
used (eg the CERN one). Under UNIX there is no method of reliably updating the 
password database with the new value of the count. With threads this is not the 
case. Implementation of this scheme would require a major rewrite of the CERN 
server and many others. This being the case I'm not too happy with using it for 
a `simple' scheme.

The mechanism also breaks down if several requests are generated and handled in 
a different order. Eg Netscape server toasting mode when loading multiple gif 
files at once. This problem also occurs in normal usage - eg have a query on a 
server that is taking some time and pop a few extra requests in at the same 
time.

Communicating the original password is a problem.

Possible problem with certain faulty hash functions. Repeated recursive 
application may turn up some sort of locus of attraction problem meaning that 
D^n(X) = D^n(Y) with a frequency dependent on n. This sort of thing is unlikely 
to occur in the range suggested by Lamport (100 ish) but I would be worried, 
particularly with MD5 for reasons I go into later.

The original scheme was designed for login type applications. HTTP works at the 
request level so there are many more communications - thousands a day in fact, 
each time I read an email I am generating a new HTTP transaction (hands off - 
not finished yet BTW).


Digest Advantages,

Password is never communicated in the clear.

Digest Disadvantages

The user password is not stored in plaintext but the digest of the pasword DP is 
all that is actually required. This may seem a major hole but the same risk is 
actually present with public key schemes where an authentication signature is 
stored in the machine itself.

Communicating the original password is a problem. As with S-Key there is still 
an advantage to using RSA etc.


Modifications,
--------------

Actually both schemes should be slightly modified in the following manner, 
instead of using the password P it is better to use a composite of the Password, 
username and server to form the Digest root.



Proposal,
---------

First off MD5 is not such a good hash function, problems with the compressor. 
SHA is much better for this purpose. Main point is it must be selectable which 
means that S-HTTP type negotiation is a factor.

Incorporate an S-Key mode into S-HTTP. I am quite happy to do client side 
implementation and server side hooks but as previously stated I can;t do a 
usefull scheme with the CERN server if its going to be forking. Even without 
forking it would be a major hassle for many other implementors. Actually there 
is a major hassle for some clients as well (not Arena or the linemode.

To do this the easiest mode would be to simply integrate it as a variant of the 
current digest scheme.

I was wondering if there is any standard regarding the message of
mouse/pointing-device actions sent by www client/browser. It seems most
browsers out there only support one kind of URL encoded action/message:

1) a click:

URL?x-coord,y-coord
where URL might be http://somehost/cgi-bin/maphandler.

What about more actions?  The objective is to minimize the unnecessary
client-server communication. Here is what I speculated:

2) select a region:

URL?"shape definition as in html 3.0 dtd"
where the html 3.0 dtd is dated 9 Jan'95 by Dave <dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com>
(http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html3-dtd.txt)

note: browser writer can use whatever method to select the region
and send the message. Example: a single button mouse can use: MB-down and
drag to form a region (depending on what kind of selection mode you are in,
a decent paint/drawing program has at least 3 selection mode: rectangle,
circle, free-form (basically polygon)), MB-release, click inside the region
to send the message; click outside the map to cancel the selection.

3) select a region and drag the region to a new position:

URL?"shape definition as in html 3.0 dtd"+x1,y1+x2,y2
where x1,y1 is a point inside the original region; x2,y2 is the new
position of x1,y1.

note: browser writer can use whatever method to select the region
and send the message.  Example: a single button mouse can use: MB-down and
drag to form a region, MB-release, move to a point (x1,y1) inside the
region, MB-down and drag the region to a new postion (x2,y2), MB-release to
send the message.

Sounds quite clear/logical/easy?

Any comments/pointers/suggestions appreciated. TIA.

P.S: Oh, an Easter egg in Netscape for you patient reader. Select
About Netscape, the "Netscape communication corporation" logo is actually
an image map. Click on it randomly, there is 94.3% chance that you will get
"The Netscape Team 1994" -- list of netscape's authors, the remaining 5.7%
chance will bring you to "The Mozilla Team 1994" which is a pretty cool
jpeg of the Mozilla team, which is also an map.  Click on the people on
photo will bring you to their home pages. How to increase the 5.7% to 100%
is left as an excersize :).  A question though, where is marca?

The HTML 3.0 SCRIBBLE widget handles arbitary pen input using the JOT  
ink standard (not just mouse input; returned data may include time  
and pressure info).  Ask your favorite browser authors to implement  
it!

Speaking of _really_ cool easter eggs, NCSA X Mosaic in fact has a  
secret prototype pen-input widget.  Unlike SCRIBBLE, it doesn't use  
the JOT ink standard, and it also doesn't allow a background image  
SRC, but it still gives a taste of the fun things you'll be able to  
do with SCRIBBLE.

I know this question has been fielded already, but...

I need to know how, if at all possible, to save an HTML file's inlined 
GIFs when saving the file to disk.

I'm using WinMosaic 2.0.8, Netscape for Windows 1.0 and Cello. I also 
have access to Lynx through dial-up to my service provider. As far as I 
can tell, there is no "save file with inlined images" option in either 
WinMosaic or Netscape. There has, I believe, been some talk of this.

Unfortunately, I need a quick answer and I'm in a situation where I have 
not done my homework soon enough and have assumed that I know more than 
I do.

Any help would be much appreciated.

TIA and regards,

Cecilia

A friend of mine has the following problem with his httpd server. 
Does anybody out there have a clue how to solve it? 

I can't find a server which doesn't crash. So far I'v tried the NCSA
server 1.3 and CERN server 3.0.6.

The bug is as follow.

1. When the server has more than x simultaneous connections. I
receive the message

     NIS: server not responding for domain
     "yphelios.genie.uottawa.ca"; still trying. 
   
2. When this message is received, the server receives new
connections, but doesn't kill the old ones. 

3. After a while (3 minutes), the process table is full and the
machine has to be reseted.

I will try to contact NCSA, and see if they are aware of the
bug. Presently I'm trying to use the CERN server (with DNSLookup
off). But it is lacking the server side include capability of the NCSA
server, the ability to have .cgi scripts everywhere and the ability to
use the description field when showing a directory (which I feel is an
important part of the archive).

Now here is where you could help me. If you know a server that could
easily handle the amount of calls received here each day (around
11000) without going `bezerk' and has a similar functionality then the
one used by NCSA, please send me an e-mail (I'm using a SPARC
sunos4.1.3). I tried the wn server (but it is really not practical for
an archive site), and the EIT server (crashed big time).

My professor told me that if I don't find a way to clear the "exiting"
process and/or not to crash our server, then our httpd server will be
closed.

Hope the www-gurus can figure out something. Maybe it's just one of
this problem with the sun. Do you think that using -lresolve would
change anything ?

I would kindly appreciate any help!

Thanks to all who posted answers to my question about saving inline GIFs to
disk.

FYI: I got a message from Carl Samos at NCSA informing me that the new
version of NCSA WinMosaic (2.0 Alpha 9) will have the option to save inline
images along with an HTML file. The new version will be out on Tuesday,
January 17.

Thanks again to all.

Hi, 

> I was wondering if there is any standard regarding the message of

I guess you're referring to supporting the new HTML 3.0 FIG construct
at the protocol level - I saw your message on www-html.

First, I'm not sure that extending the set of mouse events being sent
on the wire is in the line of FIG or HTML 3.0. I'd say on the
contrary, the idea is that none of that should happen and that with
FIG, all "mouse click"/URL mapping is now done locally, rather than in
on the httpd side (so there is no need to pass it there).
 
> 1) a click:
> 
> URL?x-coord,y-coord
.
> 2) select a region:
> 
> URL?"shape definition as in html 3.0 dtd"
. 
> 3) select a region and drag the region to a new position:
> 
> URL?"shape definition as in html 3.0 dtd"+x1,y1+x2,y2
.


We (the X Consortium) have a thousand more items to add to your list,
just check the X Protocol Version - the Event handling chapter, for
details :-)

No, seriously, you shouldn't try to re-implement a low level UI
protocol on top of HTTP, that would be a big mistake.

Is it present in the 0.9 version of Netscape, or just in 1.0 ? (I

I'm curious to know , has anyone successfully compiled and used the 
CERN Common code library on DOS and Windows?

I'm particularly interested if anyone has done so in DOS , as I am 
considering the possibilities of DOS  in  developing a graphical Web 
application.

Oh yeh , I am aware of the limitations of DOS *8).

Before this goes much further I recommend people *read* :-)

	http://www.unisys.com/LeadStory/lzwinfo.html

for information on Unisys's attitude to the use of LZW, along with

	http://www.compuserve.com/isd/news_rel/gif.html

for Compuserve's response to the new licencing deal.

As I read it Compuserve will only be charging *commercial*developers* of
programs which use GIF images whose programs are written after Jan 31st
1995. According their press release "CompuServe will not profit from
this service".

There is no general charge for storing GIFs or pulling them down from
other sites. This whole deal has been massively overhyped and there is a
lot of misinformation going around.

[BTW this in no way implies that I approve of Unisys's patenting of LZW
and the way they and Compuserve have handled the GIF issue. I also think
the development of a public domain GIF alternative could well be a good
idea]

Oh yes, for those proposing JPEG as an alternative --- I'm fairly sure
that IBM holds patents on the compression algorithms used :-)

Would some kind soul please post this alleged "announcement"? So far I have 
only heard about this through "third"-parties.

Eric from Spyglass posted to www-talk a proposal for using MD5 encryption 
in a system like this a few weeks ago - it looked solid, and I'm waiting 
for a server and a browser to implement it (WN and Arena maybe?) so I can 
set it up for HotWired.

don't see that as a huge issue.  However the above statement implies that a 
server can negotiate which type of authentication can be used:

S: Here's a challenge.  Encrypt it.
C: Huh?  
S: oh, nevermind.  Send me your uuencoded password.
C: okay, here goes....

..which doesn't seem to be in the specs anywhere.  I'd prefer not to 
have two separate URL's for different authentication schemes, though I 
could hack around that by keeping around a list of browsers implementing 
challenge-response.

Conferencing, however it is implemented, requires some form of active
notification of interested participants when something has changed so
they can avoid repeated polling of servers to find out.  Email works
fine for this purpose until the number of participants gets large
enough to justify flooded distribution to the world as in nntp news.

WWW based conferencing is interesting because it may use multimedia, and
because it is built around the archive rather than building the archive
after the fact.

Without changes to both the browsers and the external viewers it won't
be possible to have viewers display their output embedded in the
browser's window. Several solutions have been suggested:

1. The browser becomes a sort of pseudo window manager, reparenting
   the windows of external viewers.
2. Browser and viewers communicate with a special embedding protocol
   that is an extension of the X protocol (compare OLE under MS
   Windows), as in Jan Newmarch's work:
   <http://pandonia.canberra.edu.au/SW.html#embed>.
3. Viewers are not written as complete programs, but as modules to
   link (dynamically) to a browser, as in my W3A:
   <http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A/W3A.html>.
4. Viewers are written in a special embedded language for which the
   browser has an interpreter (just like Emacs is extended with
   programs in e-lisp).

In (1) and (2) additional protocol has to be specified, in order to
allow the browser and viewer to exchange commands. Currently, I have a
slight preference for (4), since it makes viewers portable to other
platforms.

Hello!

My problem is that I don't know exactly where to send this.
If you feel that you know somebody who fit better as a reader for this,
feel free to forward it.

Anyway...

I have this idea which I didn't found from anywhere I looked, so I guess
it's my job to bring it up.

The HTML language has the possibility for in-lined image. It is very useful for
e.g. imagemaps. But what about video? Wouldn't it make one hell of an
user interface to be able to click on a video image and then get the relevant
document?

The basic idea is simple. Video information is 3D in comparison to imagemap 
which is 2D. So we only need to return x,y, and t coordinates in stead of x and y 
in the imagemap case. 

As a first stage, no big modifications to browser would be needed. A simple 
"play inline video" button would be sufficient, which would start an
external mpeg player, which on its half would return the information
back to the browser, which then forms the request and hands it to the server.

Syntax on HTML (exmaple):

<A HREF="/htbin/videomap/abc/"><VIDEO SRC="abc.mpeg" ISMAP></A>

request:

similar to imagemap, except the extra 't' parameter (might be the number of
frame, compare to the physical x/y coordinates on the imagemap).

I am willing to actively participate on the development of this feature,
that is, for the next 6 months.

Let me emphasize, that some system of this kind will _inevitably_ be reality
rather soon - why let HTML get degraded? And technically, it is feasible
(I mean the browser/server modifications and additions).


Sincerely,
	
Juha Oinonen

The CERN Library of Common Code is close to compile on dos/windows and
the next release will be dos compatible - and so will the Line Mode

The CERN server can not run on a PC as it uses fork().

        Hello:

        I am a student and it is a short time, I found Mosaic. This is a
 Marvellous program. Desfortunally, I work from a terminal. This is not a
 problem to view the graphics. I have to redirecction the variable DISPLAY
 to see it. The computer where is Mosaic is IBM RISC6000 and it has Kernel
 Shell, I must do:
                export DISPLAY=host:0.0

        The problem is when I want hear sound. In my computer I have speaker,
 in a SUN SPARC Station 1+.

 But if I play sound, it is hearing in the computer when Mosaic is instalated.
 My question is: What I have done to redirecction the sound to my computer?,
 In the IBM RISC6000, exist all the resources: X Play Gizmo, xv, showaudio, 
 etc. Then, I need this in my computer? or perhaps, I must redirection the
 sound to my computer throught export any variable?

        Please, help me, and response me with any solution or tell me that 
 this is impossible for I do not lost time any more.

Interestingly enough, this thread dates back to 1993. I spent some
time trolling the archives to see what I missed during the year from
Feb '93 to Feb '94 when I had no net access. Some of it is _very_
interesting!

In response to MarcA's original proposal for an IMG tag[1], TimBL
wrote[2]:

|I had imagined that figues would be reprented as
|
|<a name=fig1 href="fghjkdfghj"  REL="EMBED, PRESENT">Figure </a>
|
|where the relation ship values mean
|
|        EMBED           Embed this here when presenting it
|        PRESENT         Present this whenever the source document
|                        is presented
|        
|Note that you can have various combinations of these, and if
|the browser doesn't support either one, it doesn't break.
|
|A see that using this as a method for selectable icons means nesting  
|anchors.  Hmmm.   But I hadn't wanted a special tag.


MarcA gave his reasons for going with IMG in [3]. Basically, he wanted
to keep things simple.

But I wish I had a nickle for every time somebody came along later and
said "why isn't the <IMG> tag more general, like an <INCLUDE> tag or
something?" I'd be rich!

I think it's high time we took another look at representing,
displaying, and composing compound documents. The issues are evidently
complex: look at OLE2 and Bento/OpenDoc.

I could plug hytime here as a standard way to express the relationship
between the various parts of a compound document, but I still haven't
done my homework on hytime yet, so I won't.

There's an "open" platform for experimenting with these issues too:
the X11R6 version of ICCCM[4] specifies conventions for embedding one
X client in another (like some ghostview and MidasWWW do with the
embedded gs window).

I'd like to see the CCI idea expanded to a full-blown "message bus"
ala tooltalk. Clearly, on the Mac platform you have to interoperate
with apple-events, and on Windows you have to interoperate with OLE.
There is no established message-passing architecture for X clients,
though the ICE protocol[5] is emerging as a basis for high-bandwidth,
secure, multiplexed interclient communication, and CORBA[6] and DCE
can't be counted out.

I think there will be lots of little protocols on the desktop:
communication between your digicash "wallet" and your browsers;
communication with your "history/hierarchy" tool, your "search"
tool, your videoconferencing tool, etc. I'd like to see all these
protocols described in an interface language, like CORBA's IDL
(though IDL has inherited lots of brokenness from C++).

The cole available from the ILU project[7] will let you:
	* specify your protocol in IDL
	* convert IDL to ISL, the interface language of the ILU project
	* build ILU stubs for various languages, e.g. C, C++, Modula-3,
		Common-Lisp, python, etc. (I think Tcl is supported too)
	* use various RPC protocols; SunRPC is currently supported, and
		the OMG TCP-based interoperability protocol is in the works
	* use various transports: SunRPC-style UDP, tcp, and I think
		there's support for AppleTalk; I expect ICE could be
		used as a transport

I'm not sure how using ILU would help you deploy on Mac/Windows
platforms.


In fact, maybe all this technology is overkill for the problems at
hand. We'll see...

Now I'll take off my propeller-head hat and put on my user hat:

* Why is it so painful to construct a message like this?  I had to
painfully copy and paste information from Netscapes "Document
Information" window or some such for each reference below.  Why can't
I just do some sort of "paste link" and get the info presto!

(hmmm... reminds me of the original NeXT WWW implementation, with
integrated hypertext editing support. Too bad NeXTStep never really
caught on!)

There are several so-called HTML editors that save you the trouble
of typing <UL>, <LI>, and <P>, but they don't help much when it comes
to linking.

I think a set of user interface conventions for hypertext GUIs will
evolve over the next year or so. Just like cut/copy/paste and the File
menu, we'll see some combination of buttons, menus, and drag-n-drop
idioms evolve into a desktop standard. Maybe by then X will be a
usable desktop platform. Maybe...

Apparently some of the Mac internet tools interoperate in sophisticated
ways like this... Anarchie, Eudora, and MacWeb apparently sling URLs
around invisibly for the user through applevents[9].

* Why is it so painful to send HTML through mail and news?
Why does the www-talk list processor munge MIME headers?
How many readers of this list have MIME-capable mail user agents
configured to handle text/html reasonably well?

Why do we spend so much energy converting mail messages to HTML on the
server side, rather than enhancing clients to understand MIME syntax?
There are quite a few lists where if you send HTML, it will be treated
as text and converted to HTML again (with considerable corruption)!

In a way, it's unfortunate that the linking syntax of HTML isn't
orthogonal to the syntax for paragraphs, bold, italics, and the
like. The MIME external-body mechanism is more appropriately
orthogonal; too bad it's so verbose!

It would make sense, though, if I could represent a hypertext document
as two separate entities: the content, and the links.  The content
could be in any format I choose, and the links would be
independent. Several of TimBL's writings on WWW refer to HTML as just
one data format among many that the web architecture could support. The
problem is that HTML is the only data format that can represent links.
The URL syntax gives the address of anchors, but there's no way
to represent the notion:

	"There is a link from URL1 to URL2"

in any existing data format except HTML. Sure, we can come up with
ways to express that notion in each data format: PDF, TeX(or dvi),
RTF, etc. But then you have to change a document to put links in it.

I recall there was a paper presented at the Geneva WWW conference
regarding links outside of documents... I'll have to go read it again.

Anyway... back to .mailcap files:


>I don't want the browser to do it itself, I'd like to be able to
>configure my mailcap file on the browser side with something like:

How about:

	video/mpeg: mpeg_play%s; embed=mpeg_play_embed %s %E

The Mailcap specification[8] allows for keywords like print=, compose=,
etc. Just add another one: embed=


Of course this requires the mpeg player to be a child process of the
browser. It doesn't allow for the case of X server on machine X, web
client on machine W, and video player on machine V, where the web
client wants to invoke the video player. That's where the
tooltalk/CORBA type stuff comes in. Obviously, it's a lot easier to do
in the Mac/Windows world where the distributed computing problems go
away :-)

The question at stake is also whether this "logical framework" should
be built on top of HTTP, on top of something else, or shouldn't be
built at all - i.e. something already exists.

What I think you described is really the differences in terms of
events handling and expectation between a low level UI protocol
(e.g. X) and a high level UI protocol (a UIMS). 

A UIMS typically provides this level of service: rubberbanding,
selection of a item in a menu, choice of a value in a scale. The
implementation of the dialog (whether or not the valuator is a Scale
widget or a SpinBox widget) and therefore the visual feedback, as you
said, is typically done on the "display side" while the logic of the
application is done where the app is run, on the "other" side.

This model happens to match the Web browser/httpd architecture, but
this is a coincidence more than anything else :-)

I got your point about X events being of one kind and WWW events of
another, but I'm still concern that we try to re-invent the UIMS wheel
here.

To some, HTML Forms over HTTP POST (or ISMAP for that matters) might
be considered as a rudimentary UIMS, but we have to remember that
these WWW protocols were not designed to make it easy or reliable for
the server to maintain any state about a specific conversation, or to
exert any real control over the conversation.

For instance, a WWW viewer expects a reply from the server following a
form submission but as far as I know, it has no guarantee of a reply,
and it won't be informed if there is no reply (or that forms are
presented multiple times or out of order, etc). There is very little
dialog control available to the information provider.

I'm not flaming the Web here, all this just stems from the original
design goals of HTTP, its statelessness in particular, and we have to
be careful when shifting our goals.

I got it!  

One day, I'll have to mention all the eggs I put in libXm over the

Subject: A working yacc/lex parser for HTML

There was some mild interest in the yacc grammar I posted a few days
ago. I suppose lots of folks were turned off by the fact that you
couldn't actually do anything with it.

It's still just a sort of study-aid, but I've done the grunt-work
of building a corresponding lexical analyzer and main program.
As alway, hands-on experience exposed some design problems with
the original grammar.

This stuff is also available at:
	http://www.hal.com/~connolly/html-test/yacc/

So this code can actually be used to parse HTML files. The Makefile
is set up to build a debuggin lexer and parser. You get output like:

Starting parse
Entering state 0
Reading a token: --scanner backing up
--(end of buffer or a NUL)
--scanner backing up
--accepting rule at line 40 ("<TITLE")
Next token is 389 (START_title)
Reducing via rule 3 (line 150),  -> start_html
[...]

--accepting rule at line 78 ("HREF=")
Next token is 266 (ANAME_href)

--scanner backing up

Reducing via rule 4133 (line 4965), LITERAL  -> attrval_cdata
state stack now 0 2 6 13 16 40 148 241

Reducing via rule 125 (line 320), attrs_a attr_a_href  -> attrs_a
state stack now 0 2 6 13 16 40
Entering state 148
Reading a token: --accepting rule at line 102 (">")
[...]


First, some caveats:

* The Makefile makes explicit reference to the local installations of
flex and bison here at HaL. It specifies gcc too. If you want to use
the lex, yacc, and/or C compiler provided by your system vendor, good
luck!

* Using gcc -Wall, Lots of warnings are issued during compilation
regarding the code that flex/bison generates. Ignore them.

* The lexical analyzer is completely missing support for markup
declarations.  It will read <!DOCTYPE, <![ and <!USEMAP as data,
failing to recognize it as markup.

* There is no code that, for example, passes the value of an attribute
value literal from the lexical analyzer to the parser. In fact, there
are no actions anywhere in the lexer or the parser. This code doesn't
do _anything_ but parse HTML.

* There is a little bit of error recovery in the lexer, but none in
the parser. This parser abort()s, for example, when tags are used
out of context.

* The business of ignoring RE characters as per section 7.6.1 of the
SGML standard is left as an excercise for the reader :-}



Finally, some observations/conclusions:

** There is no HTML-specific code in the lexer. It could be used for
any Basic SGML document. Marked section support would be nice. And
this version doesn't have very general support for entities. It
assumes they have no markup in them. Flex does support multiple input
buffers, so sophisticated entity management is possible. But if you
were that serious about this, you wouldn't be using lex/yacc!

But this lexer makes a reasonable inventory of the lexical constructs
you'll find in a Basic SGML document. (Oh! processing instructions are
missing, just like markup declarations. But they'd be trivial to add.)

Um.. there's no support for short references either, and adding it
would probably be awkward.


** I thought about ways to take the HTML specific knowledge out of the
parser, but HTML uses tag minimization on the HTML, HEAD, BODY, P, and
LI, elements; for example, in order to correctly recognize the end of
a P element, the parser has to know what elements might be found inside
P and what elements might not.

We would hope to be able to enhance existing HTML parsers to handle
arbitrary SGML document types. Some folks have proposed that internet
SGML tools might be kept simple by eliminating support for SHORTTAG
and OMITTAG. Unfortunately, that makes them unable to support HTML.


Deployment of SGML technology on the net is currently held up by a
lack of working knowledge among the development community. You could
blame that on the high cost of access to the SGML standard and related
tools and services... But this lack of working knowledge is slowly
changing. sgmls has been out for a while, and folks are finally
learning how to use it. SP and YASP are hitting the streets. We're
seeing perlSGML, CoST, and other SGML processing toolkits.

I wonder how long it will be before we see a ubiquitous libSGML just
like there's a libTIFF. And I wonder what features of the standard it
will support, and which ones it will leave for the commercial vendors
(and which ones even those guys won't touch with a 10 foot pole!)


Enough philosophizing... here's the code:

#! /bin/sh
# This is a shell archive.  Remove anything before this line, then unpack
# it by saving it into a file and typing "sh file".  To overwrite existing
# files, type "sh file -c".  You can also feed this as standard input via
# unshar, or by typing "sh <file", e.g..  If this archive is complete, you
# will see the following message at the end:

I think eventually, something along the line of OLE/Opendoc/CORBA will
have to be used to achieve embedding, but I also think having a simple
way to initiate the embeddee process (or process agent - read below)
from the browser - i.e. the mailcap extension - is a good first start,
which should't hurt (in terms of having to maintain compatibility,
etc) any future plan we might have.

My eventual goal being to run an X program on the httpd side with
display embedded in the browser, I hope it does ! (I'll be posting a
document about that X/Web stuff soon).

The only think that needs to run as a child process of the browser is
an agent that controls the embedded client execution, not the embedded
client itself. This agent gets passed the X server id, the window on
the display, and is up to remote execute the embedded process on
machine V.

Example on the simple non-embedded case:

  video/mpeg: r_mpeg_play %s

r_mpeg_play is the agent (r for remote) and it does something like:
	rsh hosta mpeg_play argv[0]

(assuming PATH, DISPLAY, etc., get passed correctly)

Same thing can be done for embedding, just using argv[1].

Of course, if everything is local, there is no need for an agent.

If there already exists such a UIMS protocol that can be easily extended as
needed then by all means use it, if legal issue is not a concern.  I don't
like to re-invent wheels either.  We just need something to agree upon -- a
standard.

My original intention was to find out if there is any logical naming
convention for variables defined in HTML Forms by different input methods. 
e.g., what variables are defined by certain input device actions?  what is
the format of the value of a certain variable, etc.  The convention should
be extensible and able to prevent name space pollution in the future.  You
might want to call the variable naming convention a UIMS protocol, if you
insist.

I thought it was easy to hack the httpd to include a defaut reply for
any form submissions if a form processor exits without echo a response. 
Is it not?

I think http is just a simple transport protocol for hypertext documents as
the name implies.  In most cases (simple html documents) the problems
(concurrent/multiple form submission etc.) you just raised are irrelavent. 
If there is need to deal with it, service provider can always implement his
own message queue and/or locks stuff in cgi scripts.  If the demand is
strong, server vendors and or third parties might provide certain
library/packages for cgi script writers to deal with the special occasions. 
I don't think sacrificing the simplicity and hence the low-overhead of the
http protocol for _occasional_ needs is worth the trouble.

After reading the docs about Proxy AND Caching, I'm still not
able to make the proxy/cache feature work with the Cern HTTPD.

I would be very happy if someone could mail me a copy of their

Hi!

I have followed with great interest the discussion of the expires header
and the possible automatic updating of pages by clients.

I have done an extensive search of the IETF archives and the working group
on HTTP's archives. I have also explored the W3O archives and WWW conference
papers online. I have found only one vague reference to adding an interactive
connection type to the HTTP spec. It was mentioned in a priority list on the
W3O WWW pages. 

Can someone point me to some more information on this work?
Has it been started yet? If not I volunteer to lead a group to look into
the issues involved with extending HTTP to support interactive objects embeded
in WWW pages.

PS. I have found only two related RFCs so far
    1) Uploading files using HTTP (found then lost the ref for this one
       please point me to the source again)
    2) A Proposed Extension Mechanism to HTTP by David Kristol, AT&T Bell Labs

I'm not sure what you're thinking of here. You're refering to a
technique, not to an architecture. To me, it might be something like
the WWWinda project, where the browser side becomes a set of
un-centralized cooperating agents, one doing HTML, one doing GIF, one
doing video, etc.

Jan's work was done while he was a sabbatical at the OSF (and while I
still was working there).
It's not an extension of the X Protocol, which is something that has a
very specific meaning (like PEX, DPS, XIE, etc), it's done in way that
reuse X component, like the new R6 Session Management work, and some
new widgets.

I just don't like relying on dynamic linking, which is still an OS
dependent feature.

Or maybe this is the WWWinda stuff in your mind ?

I personally prefer 2 over 1 and 4 (whether it is OLE, OpenDoc or
something more X specific like Jan's), in part because I'm afraid
something like WWWinda might be too radical a change in architecture.

Considering reaction times you might want to set a t offset of, say, -5.  As

viewer that has freeze frame, step, fast forward, back, etc.

Check out the Internet Starting Points Homepage (available from the
Navigation menu in Mosaic)  It provides info on the Web project, key plays,
etc.  That should be a good starting point for you.

Surf around some within the Web home pages.  I remember seeing a graph
somewhere that illustrated the exponetial growth of the WWW, but I'm not
sure exactly where it is.  

Good luck!   ?8^)

Hmmm... I wonder what resources you were consulting. There's tons

Hmmm... MERIT maintains stats on the Internet, including the Web.
Joseph Hardin gave a talk about the size of the web, including some
impressive graphs showing exponential growth. I don't where these
live, though.

I just saw a headline about how Prodigy is announcing WWW access to
their subscribers.

I wonder if this will have an effect similar to when America Online
started supporting USENET news: a whole mess of people suddenly had
access to USENET without knowing much about it, especially the culture
and the rules of netiquite.

There's a big difference, though: the USENET rules and guidelines were
written down and pretty widely agreed on. There is no such set of
guidelines for the web, as far as I can tell.

Most web users get at the web through their employer or their school
or some such entity with whom they have some other relationship. But
increasingly, folks get at the net through a service
provider. Typically, if a body abused their USENET "privileges", other
folks would complain to their postmaster or system administrator.
What are the responsibilities of service providers to control their
customers? How about responsibilities to educate their customers?

At the Geneva WWW conference, a lot of folks started talking about how
some sort of "Bill of Rights" for the WWW was needed.

Is anybody interested in discussing that here? (Can we stay civil, and
try to keep the signal/noise ratio tolerable?)

All these folks jumping on the web are sort of implicitly agreeing to
play by certain rules, but nobody knows exactly what those rules
are...

Here are some questions that come to mind when I noodle on this subject:


* How much "right to privacy" are users entitled to? Information
providers often use access logs to cost-justify their operations, so
they need to know at least generally who's accessing what. But I think
it's pretty widely agreed that keeping information like "Joe User
accessed cindy.gif at 2:47pm on Jun 12, 1994" is a violation of Joe's
privacy.


* On the other hand, nothing is currently keeping information providers
from lying about their readership. In the magazine business, there are
auditors that will check claims like "we have a 10,1000 qualified
subscribers."


* The additional HTTP requests involved with inline images causes
distortion (well... confusion at least) in server statistics. Then
there's all the gateways and caches... Do you suppose information
providers can reasonably expect cache maintainers to send some sort of
summary report of the accesses the cache masked on a periodic basis?


* What are the responsibilities of authors that make links to other
folks work? For example, the NCSA folks put my email address and a
link to some of my stuff on the "help on HTML" page. I don't remember
if they asked me before they did it or not. All I know is that I
suddenly got a zillion messages from "clueless newbies" asking how to
do server-side includes, how to center text, and how to use Mosaic.

Suppose webmaster at site X includes a link to site Y. Site Y changes
their stuff, and the link becomes stale. Joe user follows the link,
and his browser tells him "Sorry, something broke*". Joe complains
to webmaster@Y that his system is broke. If Y is lucky, he can consult
his logs and find out from Referer: info that site X is the culprit.

With folks building search services and edited collections of
pointers, this could get messy.


* What is the copyright status of text and graphics on the web? If I
see a nifty page, can I save it, tweak it a little, and stick in in my
own web? Can I grab little bullets and other icons from other folks?
I suppose the polite thing to do is to send email and just ask. And I
suppose by the letter of the law, web stuff is like email -- copying
and retransmission is forbidden except for explicit permission. Do you
suppose part of the HTTP protocol is implicit permission to cache and
gateway information? The WAIS protocol and document addresses actually
had little copyright fields built in. Hmmm....


* Can information providers tell clients not to pass on Referer:
information? That is, can an information provider declare that the
address of its documents are sensitive information, not to be
divulged? I don't think that sort of thing is practical in the near
term. I think that a certain amount of information becomes public when
you make your info available over the web.

But suppose client C uses secure-HTTP or whatever to access
confidential information at X, which contains an link to public
site Y. C's request to Y will not be encrypted, and X may consider
it's document addresses sensitive.


* I'd rather not get into discussion of when little Johnny that
discovers http://www.playboy.com/ via Prodigy, and Johnny's mom sues
prodigy for violating the terms of service... but somebody's got to
figure out how to resolve those things. I think some folks might
consider it a valuable service if Prodigy would strive to filter out
nasty stuff. Technically, I don't see how they could. I think they'll
have to wash their hands of liability on this issue somehow, but...


* Does a web document act like a newspaper or a magazine w.r.t.  lible
and slander? The web is becoming an important mass medium -- an
effective marketing tool. If Motorola puts lies about Intel on the
web, can they just put a retraction in the next day, or can Intel sue
of damages?



Is this Bill of Rights something that the IETF or the W3O should try
to write up and maintain? (I hope nobody expects them to enforce
it...) Do the documents concerning adding a host to the Internet,
maintaining an FTP archive, and posting to Usenet cover all the
issues, or are there some novel issues that should be hammered out and
spelled out?

Just thinking...

Dan

That's apparently the philosophy behind Hyper-G (well, one of many).  
The demo I tried out had a modified MPEG browser supporting links from 
regions of the movie to other objects... anyways, there's lots of other 
interesting ideas there.  http://www.tu-graz.ac.at/

In a previous thread, I had suggested that we needed a more generic
inline & include capability, and that serving multipart MIME content
types might be a good way to do this. However, much of the other
discussion on multipart support was as a way of packing output 
together, and that use conflicted with an implied inline semantics
for multipart ( unless you were going to interpret multipart/parallel
to mean "inline" or add a new C-T: multipart/inline ), so I more or
less dropped that idea. 

I now note that there is discussion on the ietf-822 mailing list
of a Content-Disposition: header ( vs. an added optional parameter
to Content-Type: ) that would, among other things, supply these
sorts of hints (inline, attached, etc.) to a MIME viewer. 

( Dan Connolly : I'll gladly send you MY nickel! :-)

As others have pointed out, the other embedding issues are a real
can of worms, so I'll save that for another post.

It'll be much different, mainly because most of the web is one-way 
content unaffected by the number or type of people who visit, unlike 
USENET where the content is entirely viewer-driven.  Now, if/when Prodigy 
and AOL were to allow people to put home pages up, it might be a 
different matter... but even then it's hard to see that "cluelessness" 
will be a problem, as ugly sites will just not get visited, meanwhile 
the potential for attractive and useful pages will be improved.  
Collaborative filtering tools will help when they arrive, and until then 
voluntary filters (like NetSurfer Digest and HotWired) will suffice.

Which was one reason we went to a subscriber-based system rather than try 
and prop up the lie of "hitrates".  At any rate, I'm sure you'll see some 
form of Neilsens-ish rating system being deployed at some point in the 
future.  The technology is already there....

When you download Prodigy's web browser is has you "sign" a message 
stating something to the effect of "Warning!  You are leaving Prodigy's 
site and entering the wild untamed Internet!  You will find adult 
material here - please sign here to verify that you are at least 18 years 
of age".  Sounds like a good solution, preferable to them hiring 
Concerned Parents of America to surf the web and tell the Prodigy proxy 
cache what not to allow through :)

I'd rather not see that happen... I think solutions to these problems 
will come organically and in accordance with other societal norms, even 
given that those norms vary from country to country.  I don't see how a 
document like that could remain apolitical, and thus subject to the tides 
of political sentiment.

When our search engine displays results lists from Web documents, we need
to display the source of the documents in the list.  Right now, all we can
offer is the name of the host, which may or may not be meaningful... and
usually rather ugly.

Thus, it's occurred to us that we'd like to see a way to ask a server
"What's your name?" and get back something like "Verity Corporate
Information."

Is anyone else thinking about this?  Shall we just forge ahead and make a
proposal for a way to implement this?  I'm thinking that perhaps it should
be an element in the header of the default document.  Ideas?

 I want to make a www-browser in experimental environment.
 But, I noticed a problem. I have no time to implement http-library.
 So, I want to use a Mosaic's http/html library.
 But, As you know, when programmers make a program using new external
 library, they need library reference. Me too.
 If someone know how I get Mosaic's http/html library reference,
 Please notify me.
 Any comment is useful to me.

Dan and other Netizens:

I think you have raised several substantive issues and would like to see
more discussion on all of them.  

I would like to add another:  How should the content of Net
messages/newsgroups/forums etc. be monitored, if at all?  

Since the Internet culture has strong historical ties to many academic
and government institutions, the issue of free speech and censorship
will definitely come up.  What if a member of a politically correct
group is offended by an electronic message?  What if the government
presses charges against the offending party?  

Mull it over...

That's something I've been grappling with: What technology is a reasonably
doable and sufficient subset, which are likely to be commercially 
successful ( which means we may have to come to terms with them,
proprietary or not ) and which are more-open/less-proprietary than
others ( and thus, which would I rather see be successful! )

I have some notes and links at: 
<http://minsky.med.virginia.edu/sdm7g/Projects/Python/SafePython.html>

These started out as notes on "safe Python" for the NIST Python
workshop, however I was also trying to look at other distributed
object technologies and figure out what was not overkill ( I
don't think any of this is really "overkill" - I mean what is 
digestible and usable in the near term. ) 

Safe-Python is an interpreted-language remote agent approach that would
safely allow client and server to send each other executable code. 
[ The two major modifications to the Python interpreter I discuss 
  are in place and being tested in the current (limited-distribution)
  Python 1.1.2 beta. There are still some back doors to be plugged 
  before I would trust it as reliable safe agentware. Also, a lot
  of documentation and examples to be written. ] 

However, despite the fact that I'm working on a language based solution,
I've expressed by doubt that a procedural language ( vs. a protocol or a 
data representation ) is a likely way to standardize interaction. 
( And that's one of the reasons I've been looking at other technology - 
 looking for a common protocol for agents and programs written in 
 different languages to negotiate and interact with each other. )

I'm not up on X11R6, but isn't Fresco supposed to provide the 
capability to write OpenDoc-like embedded documents.

The was a Mac port of an earlier version of ILU. 
I don't believe the current release has been ported. 

I'm still looking at OpenDoc/SOM/OSA (Open Scripting Architecture)
vs. ( or maybe in addition to, somehow interoperating ) ILU, but
I don't have enough application experiences with either yet to 
say much.

Apple's Open Scripting Architecture ( one of their contributions to 
the OpenDoc technology ) may just be one of those pieces that is not
too big to bite off and chew. (OSA does not depend on the rest of OpenDoc)  

OSA is a higher level protocol - it defines an API and tries to
standardize suites of messages that applications can send to each
other. AppleEvents will become OpenEvents in the portable API.
One the Mac, they will be implemented by - guess what! - AppleEvents.
The implementation on other platforms may be different, and in
fact, it is not yet determined how these events will be supported in a 
distributed environment. I had been assuming via CORBA compliant DSOM, but 
I have been told that hasn't yet been decided. ( OpenEvents could likely
be mapped onto ILU for a SOM-less portable distributed OSA implementation.
Incompatible, but easily gatewayed to a native AppleEvents or other
implementation. ) 

A postscript paper and other info describing OSA is at:
<http://minsky.med.virginia.edu/sdm7g/Projects/Python/OSA/>

I'm not necessarily recommending OSA, ILU, or OpenDoc as a solution - 
I'm still trying to digest this technology. But I think this sort
of direction is the way for the Web to go. The Web is really a sort
of poor man's distributed object system already. Lot's of MIME typed
objects but really only two "messages" ( 'display' and 'show source' )
In fact, it was the Web as an example of a reasonably doable subset of 
compound-documents/distributed-objects that inspired me to look for
the next reasonable step. 

Links and references to OpenDoc, SOM, ILU, etc. are all in there
*somewhere*. Sorry it's not in better order - it's just a snapshot
of my working notes. I have other material to organize and deposit
there when I find the time.

Yup, it's the other way around -- there are already a variety of  
formats which are hyperlinked using URLs and the Web.  And more are  
on the way from some rather large players, who hope to take over the  
Web by offering full presentation control.

Additional examples of formats that use URLs for linking: Hyper-TeX,  
WebOOGL, VRML, PDF, and apparently in the near future, MSWord (oh  
joy).

I usually fire off an SNMP query and ask the machine that way.
A fair number of 'em answer.

You should also consider
ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6untarred/xc/doc/hardcopy/Fresco describing
the Fresco toolkit. It offers a platform-independend
object-oriented approach to graphical embedding of distributed
objects. However, it is yet not platform-independend, but just X11,
not object-oriented but just C++, and you cannot distribute your
objects yet. Seems we'll have to wait a bit until it is really
useful.

OK, first  let me sumarise what I think your set-up is

You are running your client (Mosaic in this case) on the IBM with the
display set to a Sun Sparc which you are using, effectively, as an X
terminal.  Correct?

You have three possibilities:

1) redirect audio like you have redirected the display
2) run a client on your Sun
3) hack

1) I remember somewhere that there were networked audio extensions for X -
was it in X11R6?  I seem to remember NCD were in volved in developing
them - anyway when these were installed you set an audio variable
exactly the same as the display variable.  This is all from memory and I
do not have a reference - perhaps someone else can give more details.  I
know people from the X consortium read this list.

2) The simpler option might be to install your browser of choice on your
Sun, you would then get audio playing as standard without having to do
anything special.  Depending on the relative loading of your Sun and the
IBM, this might also be faster.

3) Set up a viewer for MIME type audio/basic that runs a script that 

a) copies the audio file to some directory that is NFS mounted between 
   the Sun and the IBM
b) does a remote shell to your Sun and runs the audio program on the sun
   which reads the copy on the Sun
c) deletes the copied file

Get ready - AOL and Compuserve are right behind them.  The estimates I've 
heard expect them *all* to be offering WWW access by mid summer.

I think it is an excellent idea, especially if it were expanded to include
the concepts of short_name (e.g., Widget Works Info Service) and long_name
(e.g., Widget Works Info Service/newline 123 Widget Works Drive/newline
Palo Alto, CA 94505/newline 415 765 4321/newline). 

A more general extension to the idea might result from asking, do WWW
servers and doucments need something akin to the CIP (cataloguing in
publication) data that now occurs in nearly all published books.  As WWW
servers and users proliferate, the need for improved value-added
classification schemes will also proliferate.

Since from my viewpoint this is an attribute of the server rather than the 
documents served, it should be an HTTP header, something like

One idea would be to apply a one-way function to the hostname/username 
combo.  This should allow reasonably sophisticated accounting ("just how 
often *is* cindy.gif being accessed by how many different people?") with 
reasonable privacy.

If you are linking to someone's email address, you should ask their 
permission first.  Simple courtesy.  Stale links are a problem whether the 
link is automatic via HTML hypertext or manual via references, citations, or 
whatever.  Our library consultant tells me that only about 10% of her book 
requests generated via references, citations, etc., etc. are directly 
satisfiable; books go out of print, are "in print" but out of stock while 
the publisher waits for enough orders before ordering an additional printing 
(or the book is out of stock but listed as in print while the publisher 
hasn't decided whether to actually print more copies), etc.  If the author 
of a document wants to link to another document, checks that the link was in 
operation while they write their document, and checks that the link is not 
likely to go stale i.e. there is no notice in the linked document or its 
containing local web that this is just a temporary web, the author has done 
as much as they can.  Civilizations rise and fall, businesses go bust 
(personal victim of two failed startups :)), suns go nova; the universe is 
dynamic, not static.

>* What is the copyright status of text and graphics on the web?
Depends on what the publisher wants it to be.  My assumption is that a 
document is copyrighted with no general right to tweak the document unless 
otherwise explicitly stated.
>I suppose the polite thing to do is to send email and just ask.
Nice to see an instance where common courtesy and the law agree...

This is a whole 'nother can'o'worms, wandering into the field of 
high-security applications (mandatory access controls/B-level security).  I 
have a hunch that the Web is just not suited for this kind of access, due to 
the stateless nature of HTTP as well as the various other security 
considerations you would probably want to implement at the same time you are 
protecting your Web addresses.  Security gurus: any comments?

I hope that this will be implemented as a client-side option.  There are 
people who would not care for themselves to ever be exposed to it, while 
others would want to block access for their children up until a certain age.

>* Does a web document act like a newspaper or a magazine w.r.t.  lible

Since the public part of the Web is intended as a mass medium, I would say 
so, with perhaps some modifications for the fact that the user has to make a 
conscious decision to follow a link, whereas watching TV is fairly passive 
and reading a magazine or newspaper is less so.

Checking out the license details for this software reveals a change
from last time this company posted a similar announcement:

Ah, good. So the software is usable for it's intended purpose, this time!

Looking at the open_sesame install script which is retrieved by a link from

 <http://west.ubique.com/Beta/sesame_software.html>
 
I counted two ocurrences of 

  rm -rf $some-directory 

and an automatic chaining to another script, which cannot be checked
because the first one has not fetched it yet.

This sort of thing makes folks nervous.  Echoing something like "about
to delete these files now, ok?  (yes/no/abort)" followed by a listing of the
directory about to be wiped, would give me more confidence.  Also, I
would prefer to execute the second, install, script *after* I had read
it.  Just a couple of small points.  Or do other folks on the list think
I am being over cautious?

How does this cope with multiple weblets on the same server?  For
example the Computer Graphics Unit, Geology Department, MAN T&EC and
University of Manchester and Manchester Computiing Centre are all on the
same server at the same port, just in different parts of the document
tree. We would want a different name for each part.

Strikes me this could be done with rules in the config file, rather like
CERN httpd's use of pass rules.

Well, just as you specify *areas* of XY space (eg: a circle),
you'd probably also specify *volumes* of XYT spacetime (eg: a sphere,
possibly of diameter `t').

I don't think it should be a header element of a specific doument,
that's confusing (what are the semantics of this tag elsewhere?), and
would take ages to get through an HTML WG, and the last thing we want
is yet another browser-specific new tag.

This is a slippery slope, you can end up including far too much info
in what is a only a transport protocol after all. The majority of web
applications would ignore it, and it's quite redundant to send it
every time.

I do think this sort of information would be neat, especially if it's
not limited to "Server-Longname", but could include email addresses of
the webmaster, offical host names etc. Hey, you could provide lots of
useful info, like descriptions of services, contact numbers etc.


<soapbox type="aliweb">

One way to do it is of course to use a description on a known URL (say
/site.idx) in a known format (say based on the IAFA templates). E.g:

http://web.nexor.co.uk/site.idx:

 Template-Type:  SITEINFO
 URI:            /
 Host-Name:      web.nexor.co.uk
 Admin-Handle:   webmaster@nexor.co.uk
 Owner-Organization-Name: NEXOR
 Description:    The WWW Server at NEXOR, an OSI X.400/X.500 software company.
 Keywords:       NEXOR, OSI, X.400, x400, x-400, X.500, x500, x-500

This is implementable today; reasoneably standardised (in that the
IAFA templates have been around for a while and are an ID, and there
is currently no competing alternative), and can be quite efficient if
the client gets it when needed, and caches it for future use.

</soapbox>

But then, I would say that :-) The disadvantage is that such an index
file in turn might give you far more than you want to know. I think
this is preferable to hacking individual requirements into HTML or
HTTP.

EXACTLY!  I think once database application developers realize 
that the best way to use an RDBMS is as a "smart index/query 
engine" for "Web objects" (i.e., _only_ put into the DBMS the 
attributes you want to use to search for the objects, plus the 
URL/URN/URC), "database applications" will become much more 
efficient and flexible, and there will never be a need for an 
OODBMS!    

Sort of like the old Sun slogan, "The Network _is_ the Computer", 
except in this case, "The Network _is_ the Database"!  

Thanks for the great post, Steve.

I received several responses to my question about server names, including
some that weren't cross-posted to the list.

A couple of people pointed out that one server doesn't equal one "source"
for the purpose of results lists.  I think this is a sound bit of wisdom.

One suggestion was to use the security idea of realms as named document
groups.  I'm wondering if this will effectively map, or perhaps there
should be a separate scheme.

Immediately popping to mind is the "robots.txt" file, whose purpose in life
is to instruct indexing agents and their ilk.  We're intending to use
robots.txt as the configuration file even for Web indexers.

With the latter idea in mind, I'm cross-posting to the robots list.

I think the appropriate way to indicate information about a site is with
the SITEINFO template from the IAFA/IIIR template set, at least as a starting
point.  This should be a general approach to providing site-level information
(things like access policies, administrative contacts, physical location,
etc.) about servers.  All we need is a conventional path, a la robots.txt,
where it should be looked for.

It's important to keep this general.  For instance, an oft-mentioned dream is
for a WWW client to show a spinning globe with a blinking dot indicating
the location from which data is currently being fetched.  SITEINFO can
include lat-long info, making this possible.

This template is discussed in draft-ietf-iiir-publishing-02.  An
example is given at <URL:http://www.cs.indiana.edu/siteinfo.it> for
our site.

Some sites that are in ALIWEB already have such a template, along with a
bunch of other stuff, in a file usually named site.idx.  I'd rather define
a separate location for just site-specific stuff, though; siteinfo.it seems
as good a name as any to me.

I think the "x,y" coordinate for imagemaps was a quick hack that should be
upgraded; it's very limiting.  Extending it to video would be even more
limiting.

Newer approaches involve having the document specify a polygon which
constitute an anchor in an image, along with associated attributes (e.g.
destination URL, REL or REV tags, that sort of disposition information.)
That way, browsers can clearly indicate which part of the image is a valid link
and which is not, where it goes, whether it should pop up in a separate window
or replace what you're watching, etc.

I'd suggest extending that to video by just adding a couple of attributes to
the polygon (starting time and ending time, in frames or whatever.)

Ok first I just wanted to ask if someone could provide a URL to "IUL"
or whatever the DSOM/OpenDoc alternative is these days.

Now, to respond to Steve's comments I just wanted to mention that I'm 
currently involved in a graduate seminar in distributed clien-server
computing and one of the things that has come out of our studies so far
(it's early in the semester) is that none of the available standards
is really complete or robust unto itself.  The new CORBA2 spec is going
to be a large improvement on the original and fixes a lot of the problems
that the original CORBA spec created, but overall it will be a learning
process just as the transition to an object model in general has been
in the software engineering industry. 
  As part of this course I have taken on the responsibility for writing
a dynamic language interface for a CORBA-comliant ORB called ORBeline.
The interface will be for Perl so that perl scalars , arrays, and possibly
even "blessed" objects will be translated into CORBA::object formats and
back out.  The net result will be that you can use Perl scripts to perform
queries of CORBA-compliant brokers through a fairly standardized interface.
The actual implementation that will come out of the project will be specific
for ORBeline, but I don't anticipate a whole lot of major changes necessary
for another ORB and would be willing to make a port to really popular ORB
types if persuaded ($$) or cajoled by the net community in general (free).
  I'm still in the process of exploring what exactly the ORB can capably do,
but as far as I know at this point, one potential bonus will be accessing 
DBMS's in all shapes and flavors that have a CORBA-compliant interface.
If anyone is interested in seeing particular functionality come out of the
project please mail me directly and we can discuss how your needs might be
accomplished. 
  Thanks for reading!

Both ILU and SOM/DSOM are (IMHO) significantly <i>more</i> than CORBA.
Both predate CORBA and were not trying to solve only the *distributed*
object problem, but linking and inheritance of objects from different 
compilers and languages.
Both, though, are going to be retrofitted to be CORBA 2 compliant. 
( There seems to be little disagreement that CORBA is going to define 
 the interoperable standard. )

Bill Janssen at Xerox PARC, one of the authors of ILU has posted a number
of comparisons and critiques of CORBA to comp.objects.

ILU is free and has bindings to C, C++, Lisp, Modula-3 and Python. 
(list from memory - I hope I got that right!) 
You might consider adding Perl bindings to ILU. 
( Not knowing much about the internals of ILU or ORBeline, I have no
  idea how difficult it would be to convert. )

SOM is *not* free, however CI-Labs are committed to seeing that it is 
"freely or cheaply available". I don't know exactly what that will 
work out to be - I believe IBM still owns the technology, but even
when it is transferred to CI-Labs, I don't know if they can afford 
to give it away. But even if it has to be licensed, it will be (I
believe) royalty free, so with their sliding scale membership, it's
probably not impossible for someone to join CI-Labs and port it to
Linux, for example, and redistribute it as part of that "product".

Yeah! I'm still trying to figure out how to *use* all this stuff! :-)

One thing I forgot to mention in my previous post was that all this
jazzy new capabilities comes with a lot of added complexity. One of 
the things that drew me to using Web protocols for in-house applications
was it's simplicity. I hope there is a way to preserve the (relative 
I agree with Dan's gripes) user-level simplicity. 

One reason to look at OSA is the "value added" Application Level 
standardization of the various event suites. CORBA itself does 
not organize the distributed object space in any meaningful way.
( Although, I believe that's what Common Facilities and other OMG
 standards will be trying to do - However, the last C-F draft
 I looked at was mostly blank empty space templates - i.e. "insert
 appropriate technology here!" ) OSA objects can be things like
paragraphs. Look at the paper :

One quick note about Prodgy's browser. 

It does not appear to support the base tag (like other Windows browsers). 
Anybody else concened about this? I is a pain not to have directory relative

   When our search engine displays results lists from Web documents, we need
   to display the source of the documents in the list.  Right now, all we can
   offer is the name of the host, which may or may not be meaningful... and
   usually rather ugly.

   Thus, it's occurred to us that we'd like to see a way to ask a server
   "What's your name?" and get back something like "Verity Corporate
   Information."

   Is anyone else thinking about this?  Shall we just forge ahead and make a
   proposal for a way to implement this?  I'm thinking that perhaps it should
   be an element in the header of the default document.  Ideas?

   Nick

Nick,

Thinking that the "long name" for the server was already in the NCSA
httpd configuration files, I figured it would be a small chore to edit
the httpd code to grab that and stuff it in a variable (in the header,
as you suggest) on requests.  

A quick look revealed that I was thinking of the wusage configuration file,
which has a variable "Name of your server as it should be presented".

Assuming the addition of such a variable to the configuration file,
it still is only a small step to throw that variable in the header.
I agree with your proposal, and think it would be most useful.

While there have been numerous comments regarding the use of a videomap, 
what is the bandwidth constraints that it will place on the user.  The 
increase in file size will undoubtedly cause a slower downloading time.

Considering the market on the web (with the addition of the major online 
players now rolling out web access at 9600) how feasible is it for people 
to wait?

In my own testing, I have found non-technical users to wait no more than 
15 seconds for graphics to download and the page to "paint" before they 
are impatient and ready to move on.  I would say a "high" side would be 
30 seconds - and none of this would happen at 9600 - which is where mass 
market is now coming from.

What would the implications be of better compression for a 3d file?  That 
seems to be the real issue.  Since mass market is where the $$$ will be, 
that which can be sold and made profitable must be accessible for the 
masses - a 9600.

Re: your server name, and weblets on the same server -
Can you provide this kind of information via the
Meta information file that the cern server allows?
I believe this allows you to specify mime headers that
go with a file, which will appear in the <Meta> </meta>
section of a response.

As a followup to my earlier Browser Checkup alpha announcement I wanted to
let everyone on the list know that my Browser Checkup tool
<http://www.city.net/checkup.cgi> is up and running for real now. In
addition, I have added a check so that when somebody accesses the City.Net
homepage, if I detect that they're using an "old" version of their browser,
then I prepend a note to the HTML suggesting that they get a Browser
Checkup. Hopefully, this will help with the "normal" users that would never
check to see what version of a browser they're using. If you don't see your
browser supported in Browser Checkup it is probably because the developers
for that particular browser never sent me any information. Eventually, I
hope to share this code with the Net, but I still consider it alpha, so the
code won't be available for at least a few months.

Comments are most welcome, but please send them directly to me,
altis@city.net rather than replying to the whole list.

If you're a browser developer you can help me out by sending the following
information:

Browser name:
Platform:
Latest version #:
Latest release date:
URL to the home page for the browser and/or sites to get the latest version:
Example User-agent fields from both old and new versions of your browser:

I would also like to maintain a *short* paragraph of information on bug
fixes, new features (FORMs, TABLEs, etc.) in the latest release of your
browser as an incentive to get people to upgrade. If you have that kind of
information, pass it along.

Dan,

(Geez, when it rains, it pours!  Why does the conversation in this group
always happen in spurts? Or is that a listserver artifact?)

Anyway, my comments pertaining to HTML-editing and creation of links
appear below.

   -- discussion of IMG origins, and embedding considerations deleted --

   Now I'll take off my propeller-head hat and put on my user hat:

   * Why is it so painful to construct a message like this?  I had to
   painfully copy and paste information from Netscapes "Document
   Information" window or some such for each reference below.  Why can't
   I just do some sort of "paste link" and get the info presto!

   (hmmm... reminds me of the original NeXT WWW implementation, with
   integrated hypertext editing support. Too bad NeXTStep never really
   caught on!)

   There are several so-called HTML editors that save you the trouble
   of typing <UL>, <LI>, and <P>, but they don't help much when it comes
   to linking.

   I think a set of user interface conventions for hypertext GUIs will
   evolve over the next year or so. Just like cut/copy/paste and the File
   menu, we'll see some combination of buttons, menus, and drag-n-drop
   idioms evolve into a desktop standard. Maybe by then X will be a
   usable desktop platform. Maybe...

   Apparently some of the Mac internet tools interoperate in sophisticated
   ways like this... Anarchie, Eudora, and MacWeb apparently sling URLs
   around invisibly for the user through applevents[9].

I know of two Unix-based HTML editor development efforts which are trying to
address the intelligent "slinging" of URL's for the purposes of link creation
in HTML.  A third is not HTML, but uses a different hypertext representation.

Phoenix
The first is Phoenix, a tcl/tk-based HTML editor, which allows the transfer of
a URL in one screen to a input box in an adjacent screen with a single 
click (for example, click on an item in your hotlist, it appears as the
object of a new link in the other window.  

http://http.bsd.uchicago.edu/~l-newberg/phoenix.html
   
Webber 

The second is the Webber tools, being developed under an ARPA grant as
an application in the JTF-ATD architecture.  Links are created between two
html documents in two editor application windows by two button clicks: 1 on
the source page, and the other on the target page.  Normal highlighting is
used to specify mid-HTML target anchor references.  A subsequent "Save" makes
the appropriate changes to the two HTML files involved.  A Tcl-DP Blackboard
(soon to be upgraded to IDL/C++) is used to facilitate the window-to-window
communication for the transfer of URL's so that the user never sees it.

The Webber tools, which are part of a larger all-<well-specified>types-allowed
WebServer concept, are scheduled to debut in the JTF-ATD development community
sometime this year; they are not available publicly at this time.  
The best reference available is a description of the project:
http://www.teknowledge.com/JTF/webman-overview.html 

LinksWare
LinksWare, a Mac app which we looked into about 9 months ago, allows the user
to define links simply by gesturing--pointing with the mouse, and clicking in
the window displaying the target.  This action creates the link (and reference
anchor) instantaneously because the representation of the links of each object
is separated from the content itself.  If I remember correctly, word
recognition was used to match the links to their place in the page.  The nifty
thing was that this SW could include a variety of formats of content
because it wouldn't need to know how to edit the content to put the links
in.

http://www11.w3.org/hypertext/Products/Overview.html#20



   * Why is it so painful to send HTML through mail and news?
   Why does the www-talk list processor munge MIME headers?
   How many readers of this list have MIME-capable mail user agents
   configured to handle text/html reasonably well?

   Why do we spend so much energy converting mail messages to HTML on the
   server side, rather than enhancing clients to understand MIME syntax?
   There are quite a few lists where if you send HTML, it will be treated
   as text and converted to HTML again (with considerable corruption)!

   In a way, it's unfortunate that the linking syntax of HTML isn't
   orthogonal to the syntax for paragraphs, bold, italics, and the
   like. The MIME external-body mechanism is more appropriately
   orthogonal; too bad it's so verbose!

   It would make sense, though, if I could represent a hypertext document
   as two separate entities: the content, and the links.  The content
   could be in any format I choose, and the links would be
   independent. Several of TimBL's writings on WWW refer to HTML as just
   one data format among many that the web architecture could support. The
   problem is that HTML is the only data format that can represent links.
   The URL syntax gives the address of anchors, but there's no way
   to represent the notion:

	   "There is a link from URL1 to URL2"

   in any existing data format except HTML. Sure, we can come up with
   ways to express that notion in each data format: PDF, TeX(or dvi),
   RTF, etc. But then you have to change a document to put links in it.

   I recall there was a paper presented at the Geneva WWW conference
   regarding links outside of documents... I'll have to go read it again.

So will I!  We've considered and begun including the notion of external
link representation in the WebMan work, but have back-burnered it for now.

I disagree with this.  We developed an object system behind a Web server 
for an online service.  It used a persistent object model (built out of 
Python for the prototype), allowing the invoking of methods, 
creation/deletion of objects, etc.  I had previously done a project like 
that using the miniSQL relational database, and I'd never want to do that 
again.

The problem becomes arbitrary changes in attributes, as defined by HTML
forms.  Whenever you want to add another data element, you'd have to drop
the table and recreate it.  With the Python persistent object model, just
changing the HTML form definition changed what was put in the object
store.  Plus, we had some of the objects that implemented methods
differently, for customizing the behavior.  Don't know how you'd do that
kind of overloading with stored procedures. 

Anyway, objects behind Web servers are awesome.

I'm glad you like the "named formatted file" approach :-), but I would
strongly recommend not to overload the /robots.txt file.

The two requirements (indexing meta information vs limiting robots)
are quite distinct, and IMHO better handled separately. If in future
other meta indexing systems get deployed you can just switch to those
for indexing purposes, but the robots.txt will still have a role in
controlling robots.

Overloading the robots.txt file would also cause confusion among
system admins (few enough people know what it is in the first place
:).  It would also require more effort on the part of robot writers,
so some may not bother, and then we're worse off.

well, there is no reason a robot couldn't:

	- check the /robots.txt file to find out what's restricted
	- retrieve and parse some explicit indexing info such as 
	  a /site.idx IAFA template
	- use the URL's mention in the explicit info as starting points
          for limited-depth gathering
	- fall back on existing traversal strategies.

Hi,

I am interested in all information I can get about database WWW-gateways. Is
there anything available for Ingres? How do the solutions work? I would love
a solution in which a PERL script (or C-program) issues a RPC-SQL-query and
receives the results in some structured way.

One of the URLs I found was "http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/dbgw.html"

I knew somebody would!  (I was going to say "95% of the time", 
but why deprive someone of the joy of disagreeing?  ;)

The project sounds neat, but miniSQL is not a _real_ RDBMS; 
it's a toy :)   But that's probably not relevant to your point, 
which is ...

Sounds to me like you're talking about a prototyping situation, if 
your objects are changing that frequently.  In that case, you need 
flexibility but you don't care about selecting objects using 
sophisticated semantic/relational queries, so that capability is 
irrelevant.  For apps in which the end-user wants to search 
for objects by their attributes, the attributes that are being used 
in the search had better not be in a state of continuous flux, or 
you'll have some mighty confused end-users!  For such applications, 
the objects (or at least their searchable attributes) may of course 
change, but shouldn't change very frequently.  

On the other hand, if the attributes that you are changing are 
not ones that you actually want to _search_ for the objects by, 
it's a non-problem -- they won't be stored or indexed, so 
who cares?  That would be the case with the objects' methods, 
for example (whose internal information should be hidden, and 
whose interfaces should not be changing, unless you are 
prototyping!).  

The situation you describe will present a problem for _any_ type 
of search engine that enables good semantic or relational searches, 
because it will mean constantly tearing down and rebuilding indexes 
and relationships, which is not easy in _any_ type of indexing 
system (RDBMS included, of course).  

The _queriable_ attributes of objects in applications that are 
ready for prime-time will probably be about as constant as IAFA 
standard templates.  In fact, for the sake of comprehensibility 
of the system, they should be as standard, or at least as 
well-understood, as possible.  

Incidentally, Paul, please don't take this as a flame.  Just an 
animated discussion with another Python enthusiast!  

:)

        I'm glad you've brought this up now,  Dan.   Several good threads
will spring from this.   Here I'm addressing just the privacy questions.

>privacy.

        I am a UNIX sysadmin at Rice University (by day).   A couple of
years ago ... maybe three? ... we hashed out our policy w/r/t privacy.
We concluded that as system administrators we could NOT guarantee our
users privacy,  but WOULD promise them confidentiality.   The difference
seems to be omitted or forgotten or otherwise missed,  but is important.
We stated formally that we might through the exercise of our duties
get specific information that the users might not want us to have,
but we purpose to not divulge that information unless legal or
university requirements mandated that we do so.   I like it.

        Aggregate info is a problem ...

>* On the other hand, nothing is currently keeping information providers
>from lying about their readership. In the magazine business, there are
>auditors that will check claims like "we have a 10,1000 qualified
>subscribers."

        How can one confirm this without looking at some details?

>* Can information providers tell clients not to pass on Referer:
>information? That is, can an information provider declare that the
>address of its documents are sensitive information, not to be
>divulged?   ...

        How can that be enforced?   (I've been wondering how the -m
option to PGP can *really* keep decrypted cleartext off the recipient's
disk;  recipient could very well have modified PGP to ignore it,  no?)
(then again,  I'm new to PGP and so may have misunderstood the meaning)

        There's a senseless (IMHO) law that you can't listen in on
people's cel-phone conversations.   The reason it's senseless is that
[kinda like gun control]  only the good guys will comply.   It gives
the end user  (here the cel-phone customer)  a false sense of security.
This is common knowledge for you and me w/r/t e-mail.   But the newbies
don't know.   So it'll have to start with some education.   A canonical
document that explains the facts clearly and concisely,  almost like a
constitution.

>But suppose client C uses secure-HTTP or whatever to access
>confidential information at X, which contains an link to public
>site Y. C's request to Y will not be encrypted, and X may consider
>it's document addresses sensitive.

        Seems to get back to what is practial,  for which we at Rice
happily hid behind the technology.   ;-)

        We've been putting a lot of value on privacy here in the US
lately.   I'll have to go back and re-read the constitution,  but I
don't think we're guaranteed a right to privacy.   Freedom of speech,
and freedom in general,  doesn't go hand-in-hand with privacy.   Now it's
true that someone will invade your privacy to interfere with your freedom.
But privacy itself isn't all that valuable except where it supports
freedom.   That is,  freedom is more valuable than privacy.

        But you have to trust someone.   As we  (philosophically in the US)
don't trust the government,  drawing analogy we might choose to not trust
the providers.   They might promise things that they can't deliver or
can't deliver economically,  like privacy and confidentiality.

        I'm one to argue for stronger local government and leaner
federal government.   Here too,  a local community is better able to
know its own needs,  and thus in many ways better able to meet them.
Server X must have a certain relationship with client C before sharing
the keys.   X and C must be in the same "community".   Therefore C
(the human)  must agree to abide by whatever "law" says that X's
document addresses shall not be divulged.   It gets simple:
if C won't play by the rules,  then C can't enter into the game.
So C (the human) won't knowingly run a client program that leaks.

        Getting back to the committment we made at Rice and how it
relates to the Web:  the user has NO "right to privacy" once the user's
activities take him beyond the realm of those promising privacy.

We at UCSF have implemented a mechanism to handle arbitrary
MIME types in hypermedia user agents (e.g. Mosaic).  Below is
a proposal for discussion of our protocol with revisions based 
on the latest HTTP/1.0 specification and the proposed CCI 
protocol from NCSA.

Our current implementation is for XMosaic 2.4 and we plan on
releasing the source code for this version in addition to some
sample applications that enhance Mosaic (e.g. an embedded MPEG
movie player).

We would like your comments on this protocol.

Constituent Component Interface++ -- CCI++

Status of this Memo

This document is an Internet-Draft style protocol compiled at the
Center for Knowledge Management at the University of California,
San Francisco.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts

Abstract

The Constituent Component Interface++ (CCI++) is an application-
level protocol to support integrated presentation of structured
hypermedia documents.  A practical hypermedia user agent (HMUA)
requires support for a wide variety of data types, presentation
techniques and access protocols.  CCI++ provides a basis to build
cooperative suites of small applications that work in concert to
produce an integrated presentation of information retrieved from
network accessible resources. Component applications extend both
the presentation and access repertoire of a hypermedia user agent
by providing content-type support (e.g. PostScript=99) as well as
protocol support (e.g. NNTP).

CCI++ was first named the Distributed Hypermedia Object Embedding
(DHOE) Protocol [1] and was used in a distributed compound object
system in late 1993 to integrate texts, movies, images, and 3D
object data, resided on various sites of a network via a two-way
messaging mechanism between the compound object container (browser)
and the object handlers.  The original DHOE Protocol has then been
modified to free the protocol from X Window System dependence and
this specification reflects preferred usage of the protocol.

The Constituent Component Interface++ (CCI++) is an application-
level protocol to support integrated presentation of structured
hypermedia documents.  A practical hypermedia user agent (HMUA)
requires support for a wide variety of data types, presentation
techniques and access protocols.  CCI++ provides a basis to build
cooperative suites of small applications that work in concert to
produce an integrated presentation of information retrieved from
network accessible resources. Component applications extend both
the presentation and access repertoire of a hypermedia user agent
by providing content-type support (e.g. PostScript=99) as well as
protocol support (e.g. NNTP).

CCI++ is based on the de facto standards for resource reference
(Universal Resource Identifier - URI) [2], location (Universal
Resource Locator - URL) [3], name (Universal Resource Name - URN)
[4]; access protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP); content-
type and format specification (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions - MIME) [4]; and document structure (Hypertext Markup
Language - HTML).  CCI++ was first termed Distributed Hypermedia
Object Embedding (DHOE) and was used in a open and distributed
compound object system in late 1993 to integrate text, movies,
images, and 3D object data from a variety of network servers [1].

Note that since CCI++ is derived from CCI and HTTP, it adopts most
of the conventions, rules and characteristics of CCI and HTTP, and
this document is compiled based on the HTTP/1.0 draft.

1.2  Overall Operation

The CCI++ protocol is based on a request/response paradigm.  Each
participating CCI++ application sends and receives messages
asynchronously in communication with a hypermedia user agent
(HMUA).  The HMUA initiates all cooperating applications and
manages the presentation of the integrated hypermedia document.  A
requesting program (termed a client) establishes a connection with
a receiving program (termed a server) and sends a request to the
server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version,
followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers,
client information, and possible body content. The server responds
with a status line (including its protocol version and a success or
error code), followed by a MIME-like message containing server
information, object meta-information, and possible body content. It
should be noted that a given program may be capable of being both a
client and a server; our use of those terms refers only to the role
being performed by the program during a particular connection,
rather than to the program's purpose in general.

On the Internet, the communication generally takes place over a
TCP/IP connection. The default port is TCP 8000, but other ports
can be used. This does not preclude the CCI++  protocol from being
implemented on top of any other protocol on the Internet, or on
other networks. The mapping of the CCI++  request and response
structures onto the transport data units of the protocol in
question is outside the scope of this specification.

For the current implementation, the client establishes connection
to the server listening on a given port, and the connection is kept
alive until the service is no longer needed.  However, this is not
a feature of the protocol and is not required by this
specification. Both clients and servers must be capable of handling
cases where either party closes the connection prematurely, due to
user action, automated time-out, or program failure. In any case,
the closing of the connection by either or both parties always
terminates the current request, regardless of its status.  Although
not explicitly stated in the protocol, a client (e.g. browser)
usually acquires the locations of various available servers, either
through start-up resources, or from another server.  A client may
also launch the server as a data handler to decipher the data types
it is unable to handle.

Each HMUA supports an inherent set of data types (e.g. only MIME
content-types =93text/html=94 and =93image/gif=94 are supported by NCSA
Mosaic) and an inherent set of protocols; other types and procotols
are supported through helper applications and gateways.  However,
helper applications are not integrated with the browser and gateway
functionality is dependent on the existence of a gateway server.
The CCI procotol extends the HMUA with support for abitrary data
types and access protocols.

The HMUA initiates a CCI++ connection with a locally defined
application whenever a server responds with a non-inherent content-
type.  The local application may simply translate the format (e.g.
=93image/jpeg=94 to =93image/gif=94), acting as a local filter, or it may
present a control panel and allow the user to control the
integrated presentation of the resource (e.g. an =93image/mpeg=94 movie
viewer).  In addition to content-types, the HMUA also may launch a
local application when attempting to access a resource via a non-
inherent protocol.

Example:

     1. Mosaic requests URL http://<server>/<opaque>
     2. HTTP server responds with a content-type of
=93application/pdf=94
     3. Mosaic launches local application to handle Adobe PDF
format
     4. PDF helper application returns =93text/html=94 content to
Mosaic:
          <HTML>
          <HEAD>
          <TITLE>CCI Protocol</TITLE>
          </HEAD>
          <BODY>
          <A HREF=3D=93http://<server>/<opaque>=94>
          <IMG SRC=3D=93CCI%20Protocol/Page1=94 ISMAP>
          </A>
          </BODY>
          </HTML>
          5. Mosaic displays the content with the mapped image
     6. User clicks on mapped image
     7. Mosaic informs local application of requested resource:
          301 GET http://<server>/<opaque>?301,402
     8. Local application interprets URL and sends content to
Mosaic

For the current implementation, the client establishes connection
to the server listening on a given port, and the connection is kept
alive until the service is no longer needed.  However, this is not
a feature of the protocol and is not required by this
specification. Both clients and servers must be capable of handling
cases where either party closes the connection prematurely, due to
user action, automated time-out, or program failure. In any case,
the closing of the connection by either or both parties always
terminates the current request, regardless of its status.  Although
not explicitly stated in the protocol, a client (e.g. browser)
usually acquires the locations of various available servers, either
through start-up resources, or from another server.  A client may
also launch the server as a data handler to decipher the data types
it is unable to handle.

2.  Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar

Please refer to the HTTP/1.0 draft for information about Augmented
BNF and basic rules.

3.  CCI++ Message

CCI++ messages consist of requests from client to server and
responses from server to client.

     CCI++-message       =3D Simple-Request
                    | Simple-Response
                    | Full-Request
                    | Full-Response

Full-Request and Full-Response use the generic message format of
RFC 822 [5] for transferring objects. Both messages may include
optional header fields (a.k.a. "headers") and an object body. The
object body is separated from the headers by a null line (i.e., a
line with nothing preceding the CRLF).

4.  Usage of RFC 822 and MIME Constructs

Like HTTP/1.0, CCI++ reuses many of the constructs defined for
Internet Mail (RFC 822, [5]) and the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME, [4]) to allow Object's to be transmitted in an
open variety of representations.  Please refer to the HTTP/1.0
draft for the constraints HTTP/1.0 does not obey, and further
information about various formats and types.

5. Request

A request message from a client to a server includes, within the
first line of that message, the method to be applied to the object
requested, the identifier of the object, and the protocol version
in use. For backwards compatibility with the more limited HTTP/0.9
protocol, there are two valid formats for an HTTP request:

     Request        =3D    Simple-Request | Full-Request

     Simple-Request =3D    "GET" SP URI CRLF        ; HTTP/0.9
request

     Full-Request   =3D    Request-Line        ; see Section 5.1
                         General-Header      ; see Section 4.3
                         Request-Header      ; see Section 5.5
                         Object-Header       ; see Section 7
                         CRLF
                         [ Object-Body ]          ; see Section 3.2

If an CCI++ server receives a Simple-Request, it must respond with
an CCI++ Simple-Response. Similarly, if a client receives a
response that does not begin with a Status-Line, it should assume
that the response is a Simple-Response and parse it accordingly.

Please refer to HTTP/1.0 draft for detailed information about
different types of requests as well as definitions and formats of
version information, URI, and request header fields.

5.1  Request-Line

The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the URI
and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are
separated by SP characters. No CR or LF are allowed except in the
final CRLF sequence.

     Request-Line   =3D Method SP URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF

5.2  Method

The Method token indicates the method to be performed on the
resource identified by the URI. The method is case-sensitive and
extensible.

     Method         =3D "GET" | "DISPLAY" | "POST"
                    | "SEND" | "DISCONNECT" | "QUIT"
                    | "CONFIGURE" | "EVENT" | "UPDATE"
                    | extension-method
     extension-method=3Dtoken

Note that all CCI methods are kept for backward compatibility.
Those methods which not available in CCI are CONFIGURE, EVENT, and
UPDATE.

The methods SEND, DISCONNECT, CONFIGURE, EVENT, UPDATE, must be
supported by all conforming CCI++ servers. The list of methods
acceptable by a specific resource can be specified in an "Allow"
Object-Header (HTTP/1.0 draft Section 7.1). However, the client  is
always notified, through the return code of the response, whether
a method is currently allowed on a specific resource, as this can
change dynamically. The set of common methods for CCI++ is
described below. Although this set can be easily expanded,
additional  methods cannot be assumed to share the same semantics
for separately  extended clients and servers. Servers should return
the Status-Code  "501 Not Implemented" if the method is unknown.

5.2.1 GET

GET ( URL | URN ) <url> [ OUTPUT ( CURRENT | NEW | NONE ) ]

As in HTTP, the GET command tells the browser to resolve the given
URL.  The resulting object will be either be displayed by the
browser (when the output option is CURRENT or NEW) or returned to
the external application that issued the request (when output
option is NONE).  Location of where the output is displayed is
optional with the default being the current window.

If the output option NONE is specified then the URL will not be
displayed by the browser, rather it will be returned directly to
the external application.  This allows an external program which
does not understand HTTP to use the browser for data retrieval.

5.2.2 POST

POST <host>:<port>
Content-Length: (length of MIME body)
..MIME body...

The POST command tells the browser to forward the following MIME
body to the specified HTTP server (<host>:<port>).  It serves the
original purposes of the POST method in HTTP:

   o  Annotation of existing documents;

   o  Posting a message to a bulletin board topic, newsgroup,
mailing list, or similar group of articles;

   o  Providing a block of data (usually a form) to a data-handling
process, or a script which can be run by such a process;

   o  Extending a document during authorship.

A successful POST does not require that the object be created as a
resource on the origin server or made accessible for future
reference. That is, the action performed by the POST method might
not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this
case, a "200 OK" is the appropriate Status-Code returned in the
response. If a resource has been created, "201 Created" should be
the response.

Note: The user agent may not assume any postconditions of the
method in terms of web topology. For example, if a POST is
accepted, the effect may be delayed or overruled by human
moderation, batch processing, etc. The user agent should not rely
on the resource being immediately (or ever) created.

5.2.4 SEND

The SEND method is used to transmit information from the external
application to the browser and vice-versa.  To be backward
compatible with CCI, this method has several variations:

(a) SEND DATA

SEND DATA [ ( CURRENT | NEW ) ]
Content-Type: data type
Content-Length: (length of data body)
..MIME body...

The SEND DATA command transmits data from the external application
to the browser which then displays the data.  The data message
begins following the <CRLF> after the Content-Length line.

The optional output (CURRENT|NEW) suggests to the browser where to
display the document.  With the CURRENT option, the document should
appear in the active window, while NEW would specify that a new
window should be created to display the data. If output is not
specified the default is to display in the current active window.

(b) SEND ANCHOR
    SEND ANCHOR STOP

This message informs the browser to send all activated URL anchors
to the external application.  The browser is intended to continue
sending activation messages until a SEND ANCHOR STOP message is
sent.  Output from the browser to the external application will be:

     301 ANCHOR <url>

(c) SEND OUTPUT <type>
    SEND OUTPUT STOP <type>

This message informs the browser to send all subsequent objects
with the specified MIME <type> to the external application. The
recipient will then be responsible for displaying the output.

Output from the browser.

     306 Viewer output
     Content-Type: data type
     Content-Length: (length of data body)
     ... data body ...

5.2.5 DISCONNECT

In CCI, this method notifies the browser that connecting
applications will be exiting.  CCI++ requires the external
application to understand this command as well (e.g. the browser
may try to shutdown the connection when it is being manually
terminated by a user).

5.2.6 QUIT

In CCI, this request tells the browser to shutdown.  It is intended
for clean up when the browser is used as a slave process and the
master application is exiting or will no longer be using the
browser.  QUIT will also be used for the browser to shutdown the
external application in CCI++ because in a distributed compound
document system, the user interacts primarily with the browser, and
the browser should be able to terminate the external application or
data handler when it no longer needs the particular type of data-
handling service.

5.2.7 CONFIGURE

CONFIGURE is used by the external application to inform the browser
of specific actions of which it wishes to be informed.  It has the
following forms:

(a)  CONFIGURE EVENT CLEAR ( BUTTON | KEY | AREA | ALL )
     CONFIGURE EVENT ( ADD | REMOVE ) ( BUTTON | KEY | AREA ) <p>
<ap>

CONFIGURE EVENT is used by an external application to inform the
browser of the event(s) in which it is interested; the optional
CLEAR token is used for reset. The type, parameter, and
additional_parameter can be one of the following:

type           parameter                additional parameter
=3D=3D=3D=3D           =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D               =
 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
BUTTON         ( UP  | DOWN | MOTION )       <button code>
KEY            ( UP  | DOWN )           <key code>
AREA           ( EXPOSE
               | HIDE
               | DESTROY
               | RESIZE
               | ENTER
               | LEAVE )

Output may be:

     200  OK   ; events successfully cleared or registered

Any registered events that occur subsequent to the CONFIGURE EVENT
request will be sent to the external application asynchronously.
For BUTTON and KEY events, modifier information is included in the
message; allowable modifier states are: SHIFT, CAPS, CONTROL, and
META.  Output may be:

     306 Viewer event
     AREA EXPOSE
     306 Viewer event
     BUTTON DOWN 1 SHIFT META
     306 Viewer event
     KEY DOWN c CONTROL
     306 Viewer event
     BUTTON MOTION 200 300 SHIFT META

(d) CONFIGURE METHOD ( GET | POST | PUT ) ( NOTIFY | START | STOP )

CONFIGURE METHOD is used by an external application to capture the
browser's actions on different anchor events.  The external
application can choose to be simply notified or to have complete
control (i.e. stop the browser from processing all anchor events)
over all anchor events.  The anchor events are forwarded  to the
external application until it issues a STOP command of the same
type.

type           additional_parameter
=3D=3D=3D=3D           =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D
GET            NOTIFY, START, or STOP
POST           NOTIFY, START, or STOP
PUT            NOTIFY, START, or STOP

Output may be:

     307 Viewer method
     GET URL http://www.foo.com/blech?200,300
     307  Viewer method
     POST URL nntp://news.foo.com/comp.infosystems?follow-up-
to=3D1234
     Content-type: body type
     Content-length: (length of MIME body)
     ... MIME body...

5.2.8 EVENT

The EVENT method is designed for the browser to send the event(s)
an external application is interested in when it/they occur(s).

e.g. EVENT CLIENT_AREA DESTROYED
     EVENT KEY_UP XK_p
     EVENT BUTTON_MOVE 3

5.2.9 UPDATE

The UPDATE command tells the data handler/browser to give the most
up-to-date output (e.g. recompute when there is a GUI state change
or refresh when the image in the drawing area window does not
correspond to that in the buffer).

6.  Response

If the client has issued a CCI++ request, the response from the
server shall consist of the following:

    Response       =3D Simple-Response | Full-Response

    Simple-Response=3D [Object-Body]

    Full-Response  =3D Status-Line              ; see Section 6.1
                     *General-Header          ; see Section 4.3
                     *Response-Header         ; see Section 6.4
                     *Object-Header           ; see Section 7
                     CRLF
                     [ Object-Body ]          ; see Section 3.2

6.1  Status-Line

The Status-Line consists of the protocol version followed by a
numeric status code and its associated textual phrase, with each
element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except
in the final CRLF sequence.

    Status-Line =3D CCI++-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase
CRLF

6.2  CCI++ Version

The CCI++-Version element identifies the protocol version being
used by the server. The format of this field is identical to the
corresponding HTTP-Version field in the Request-Line described in
HTTP/1.0 draft Section 5.3.

6.3  Status Codes and Reason Phrases

The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the
attempt to understand and satisfy the request. The Reason-Phrase is
intended to give a short textual description of the Status-Code.
The Status-Code is intended for use by automata and the Reason-
Phrase is intended for the human user. The client is not required
to examine the Reason-Phrase, nor to pass it on to the human user.

    Status-Code    =3D 3DIGIT

    Reason-Phrase  =3D token *( SP token )

All responses, regardless of the Status-Code, may contain an Object-
Header and/or an Object-Body. This can either be the object pointed
to by the requested URI or an object containing further explanation
of the Status-Code. In the latter case, the preferred media type is
"text/html", but "text/plain" is also acceptable.

The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of responses
known to HTTP. The last two digits do not have any categorization
role. There are 5 values for the first digit:

   o  1xx: Not used, but reserved for future use

   o  2xx: Success - The requested action was successfully received
and understood

   o  3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to
complete the request

   o  4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or is
inherently impossible to fulfill

   o  5xx: Server Error - The server could not fulfill the request

The values of the numeric status codes and an example set of
corresponding Reason-Phrase's are presented below. Every Status-
Code has a description of which method it can follow and any
metainformation required in the HTTP-header (refer to HTTP/1.0
draft).

6.3.1 Successful 2xx

This class of status codes indicates that the client's request was
successfully received and understood.

200 OK
201 Created
202 Accepted

Please refer to HTTP/1.0 draft for detailed information about the
2xx class messages (and messages 203-206).

6.3.2 Redirection 3xx

This class of status codes indicates that further action needs to
be taken by the client/external application in order to fulfill
the request.

CCI++ may not need all the redirection messages (301-304) in
HTTP/1.0, interested readers may refer to HTTP/1.0 draft for
further details.

305 Acceptable options

This is required by CCI++ for negotiation between the browser and
an external application.

6.3.3 Client Error 4xx

The 4xx class of status codes is intended for cases in which the
client seems to have erred. The codes can follow any method
described in Section 5.2, and the set consists of:

400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
402 Payment Required
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
405 Method Not Allowed
406 None Acceptable
407 Proxy Authentication Required
408 Request Timeout

Please refer to HTTP/1.0 draft for detailed information about the 5
class messages.

6.3.4 Server Errors 5xx

Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases
in which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of
performing the request. These codes can follow any method at any
time.

Note: For all of the 5xx codes, the server is encouraged to send
back a CCI++-header and an Object-Body containing an explanation of
the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
condition.

500 Internal Server Error
501 Not Implemented
502 Bad Gateway
503 Service Unavailable
504 Gateway Timeout

Please refer to HTTP/1.0 draft for detailed information about the
5xx class messages.

6.4  Response Header Fields

Please refer to HTTP/1.0 draft.

I have long been under the impression that HTTP/gopher's
one-process-per-request, as opposed to FTP's one-process-per-session
technique allows the same class of machine to handle an order of
magnitude more HTTP clients than FTP clients, typically. For example,
most microcomputer labs encourage folks to use a gopher client rather
than an ftp client.

Recently, I had an email exchange with a system administrator who gave
data showing that using HTTP to serve an archive of data caused a
higher load on the machine, even though the actual net traffic served
was less.

Does anybody have any data or first-hand experience to share? Does
HTTP really fail to be lighter weight than FTP? Or did the above
sys admin probably have a very atypical setup, or a misconfigured
server?

Dan Connolly asked about the relative weight of the FTP and HTTP protocols.
I have no first-hand experience to share, but will make the observation that
most Web browsers (until Netscape was released?) treated FTP as stateless,
so it was still one connection per file with the added overhead of user
authentication for each file transmitted.  It's hard to see how FTP could be
"lighter weight" than HTTP under those conditions.

I think Netscape caches FTP connections, however.  I can't otherwise explain
the speed of succesive file retrieves from ftp servers and the output of
netstat that shows ESTABLISHED connections long after I've left the server.
Their downfall at one point seemed to be that they maintained ftp
connections far too long, so that they were consuming valuable slots on
heavily used ftp servers that restrict the number of connections.

In short, if you're worried about serving FTP-based information to people
with Web browsers you'll have to try and understand the mix of clients
(traditional ftp programs vs. inefficient first generation Web browsers vs.
more efficient tools like Netscape) to see which is the better protocol.

HTML FORMs, despite their glaringly obvious limitations as a UIMS,  
are available to essentially anyone able to access the Web, whatever  
platform they may use.  That's a very valuable assumption, which  
can't be made about X.

Agreed.  While the Web needs a way to handle stateful transactions,  
such "session" capabilities must be added with *great* care.

Sessions are an optimization, and the optimizations suitable for  
turning the Web into a global distributed software system are  
different from those suitable for implementing a desktop UIMS.  In  
particular, because the Web has a larger client/server ratio than  
your typical UIMS, the advantages of maintaining state on the client  
side instead of the server increase in the Web setting.

I generally find it useful to seek similarities between the new realm of
electronic interaction and the old way of doing things.  Mail ordering a
product, especially one of a distinctive kind, tends to trigger a lot of
similar junk mail.  For example, I've bought a few books on the Civil War
and now I get lots of targeted mailing for Civil War buffs.  AS WWW
servers become more and more embedded in commerce, could WWW providers
legally sell lists of users known to hae certain interests?

What is the social relationship between a WWW provider and a WWW reader? 
A book store has lots of different kinds of materials on open shelves and
when someone stops by to browse, they are not guaranteed privacy in the
sense that others are prevented from watching them browse and seeing what
they pick up.  On the other hand, there are the precedents set with regard
to restricting the public availability of movie-rental data.

Ultimately, the "rights" to WWW privacy and confidentiality will be
settled by lawyers, jurists, and legislators, not by a consensus among WWW
developers. In a cover-your-butt sense, WWW providers should ask what
actions on their part might expose them to liability.  Nowadays, if you
open a small clothing store and somebody happens to fall down and get hurt
on the sidewalk in front of it, you can get sued and it may cost you
thousands of dollars, or more, just to respond.  

Putting up a WWW server is in some very real sense equivalent to opening a
store for business.  In a litiginous society, any ofering of public
services is accompanied by some risk of attracting adverse legal action. 
It might be a good idea for WWW providers to get (and share?) some legal
advice on these issues.  

For example, suppose you run a WWW site and you don't really worry about
system security because everything on your server is automaticaly spawned
from some protected system inside your company's firewall.  So a hacker
breaks into your system easily and runs off with you WWW logs, which turn
out to have some interesting information of the sort: Joe Congressman has
been hitting on the cindy.gif server 20 times a day.  This gets out.  Are
you liable becauser of a failure to take adequate steps to protect the
privacy/confidentiality of your users?

Maybe some of the corporate folks who communicate on this wire might ask
their legal departments for some advice, then share it.  On the other
hand, asking legal for advice can sometimes attract unwanted attention and
concern from the professional worriers...

I am sure that many who read this will react with disdain toward thse
concerns.  Actually, I share that disdain for the results of a society
ready to sue at the drop of a byte.  That disdain, however, is no
protection against such a suit.

The intent, I think, is to keep you from *accidentally* leaving the 
unencrypted text around. Obviously if you run it in something like 
"script" you can save the output.

It's interesting to note that police can arrest you for what you say over 
the cell-phone that someone else heard, as long as they weren't 
*intentionally* listening for you.  Bleh.

Depends on which constitution. Don't forget we have 51 of them if not more.
Many states have explicit rights to privacy in their constitutions.

  The CERN libWWW code has _always_ cached ftp connections.  Therefore, it
takes a conscious decision of a browser author to disable it.  I know for
certain that at least: AIR Mosaic, Emacs-w3, LineMode Browser, Cello,
WinMosaic, OmniWeb, ad nauseum, all did this correctly.  I think that for a
time Mosaic/X was broken in this regards, but am not 100% sure.  Not sure
about MacWeb, WinWeb, or MacMosaic.  I'm pretty sure that all the SpyGlass
mosaics have always worked correctly in this regard, but could not swear to
it.

  This is a bit of a problem.  Browsers should have a user-specifiable
timeout for each ftp connection.

  I'll argue against the 'inefficiency' of the first generation web
browsers. :)

Another thing worth looking at is HyTime FCSLOCs
(finite coordinate system locations).  Those can
be used to define rectangular ranges in any number
of dimensions:

    <link id=video1 rel=embed href="video1.mpg">
    <fcsloc locsrc=video1>100 110  0 250   0 200</fcsloc>

would link to the area (0,0) -> (250,200) of
frames 100-110 of "video1.mpg", for example.

Of course, FCSLOCs can't specify polygonal regions,
so we'd still need a NOTLOC (application-defined
location notation) for those.

(IMHO, HyTime defines a lot of useful concepts
but almost no useful features.  I don't think it's
worth the effort to add full HyTime support to
browsers, but many of the basic concepts and 
mechanisms are definitely worth looking at.)

I suspect it's a little late to establish a web-wide"charter" in the style
of newsgroups', especially one that would meet with wide agreement.  The
audiences are also very different.  Newsgroup charters try to regulate
postings to the group, which any user can easily make -- the charter speaks
to every user but the permanent lurker.  On the web -- at least, for most
of the issues Dan raised, privacy, copyright, libel, citation -- most
provisions of a charter would address the provider, not the user.  If a
"bill of rights" were to be written, it would probably serve better as a
"responsibilities of the provider" fyi, distributed with server software
and made available to all page authors.

Two consenting processes, in the privacy of their own socket....?  I think
sites distributing sexual material are much less likely to be the center of
a web/privacy blowup -- I see the real candidate as commercial sites,
collecting direct marketing information from web hits.  (Possibly,
commercial sites selling sexual materials.....)  Unfortunately, the set of
commercial interests rushing sites onto the web are the _least_ likely to
read or heed a "responsibilities" fyi.

Yes, there are certainly novel issues.  Yes, I would like to see the W3O or
the IETF (in that order) write up some guidelines for the use of log
information, practices of cross-referencing, and so on.  I also hope no one
expects any enforcement of these rules, but I'd much rather have strongly
worded, unenforced suggestions than even one full-blown lawsuit.  If the
former can stave off the latter, it'd be worth the effort.

What??  If that isn't obvious, I don't know what is.  I sure hope the  
patent office doesn't fall for this one, although I can't say I'm  
optimistic.

I'm not as certain about this as I formerly was.  Perhaps we should think
of stateful protocols as something that should be implemented in
task-specific helper applications.

Our Topic Information Agent for Mosaic (the work that we announced with
Spyglass at Internet World) is essentially a helper application for search,
retrieval and various other information agent tasks.  However, we've also
recognized that once we have our agent software on the client, our Topic
Agent Protocol is available, so we can establish a TAP connection to a
Verity server, taking advantage of TAP's strengths for search, etc. agent
applications; TAP includes sessions, statefulness, etc.

An interesting paradigm seems to be emerging.  HTML and HTTP are the
default document type/user interface and protocol, so that Mosaic (and its
ilk) can remain the centerpiece of Web usage, but helper applications can
add new document types (Acrobat, SGML, etc.), user interface features and
protocols.

Certainly we've all long accepted viewers as a means to add new document
types.  Is it unreasonable to think of viewers as also having the ability
to add function-specific UI features and protocols?  I hope so, since
that's what seems to be happening.  It's the old "flock of collaborating
applications" idea that floats through here periodically, except that
Spyglass' business strategy is helping to make Enhanced Mosaic, in
particular, the leader of the flock (shepherd?).  As long as a Web client,
speaking HTTP and viewing HTML, is at the center, we don't lose the
advantages of the global standards.  E.g., Topic Agent for Mosaic always
bounces you back to Mosaic when you want to view and navigate HTML.

For example, our Web server is usable by any HTML/HTTP client that supports
forms.  However, the features we can deliver are greatly limited by HTML
and HTTP.  Customers who want the rest of our features can buy our TAP
communications module (which is a server unto itself; you can start with
TAP and add the Web module after) and distribute Topic Agents for Mosaic to
their users.  The result is that while maintaining compatibility with the
Web's standards, they can offer significantly enhanced capabilities to at
least some of their users.

This approach seems fundamentally good to me from the standpoint that it
helps HTML and HTTP from trying be all things to all people.

That's the source of my caution.  I'd much rather keep HTTP stateless  
than to have to deal with poorly designed, limited statefulness in  
the protocol.  And I've been very vocal in defending the stateless  
purity of HTTP on this list.

But at the same time, we're seeing a proliferation of stateful helper  
applications and protocols, with lots of overlap and duplication.   
The result is that none of these systems is widely used enough to be  
compelling for most users to install (or for popular clients to  
support them directly).  That's not an issue in the kind of  
commercial niche you describe (for which a specialized application is  
probably better anyway).  Nevertheless, I feel that there is a broad,  
common need that could be better filled by some standard than by the  
current cacophony of local hacks.

W3C has identified this as an target area of work and, once they get  
the ball rolling I trust them to do a good combination of design,  
testing, and feedback.  (I have no intention of even considering  
CCI++ as a contender in this regard, at least until its designers  
come clean on their proprietary intentions.  Can you say "Unisys"?)

The answer is... it all depends. FTP uses an extra control connection,
plus one connection per file - however, it only forks once per session.
HTTP forks once per request, so it should use more CPU there. 

The problem may well be down to the particular implementation of HTTP/FTP.
NCSA httpds have the well known problem when reading HTTP/1.0 headers that
raise the CPU  requirements. Both CERN and NCSA are cpu limited for a 
10Mbps ethernet and 4K requests

We could discuss whether or not search and retrieval agents and such are a
broad application or a niche... but I'll avoid the issue altogether by
suggesting that even for applications that are destined to be pervasive, I
don't think it's an issue that they may start life as helpers and
presumably the strongest ones migrate into a more tightly integrated and
standardized implementation.

To be practical, there's no way to stop various companies from implementing
their own document types, protocols and helper UIs.  As long as HTTP/HTML
is there is tie them all together, so that a default continues to exist,
then the rest can compete for survival.  Those that thrive are probably
destined for integration and standardization.

Those that aren't useful in the context of the Web just won't get
implemented in a mainstream browser... Does anyone think that Telnet will
migrate into the browsers?

Nick

P.S.  An e-mail on this subject reminds me that in addition to HTML and
HTTP, URLs are a fundamental enabling standard that third-party
enhancements can use.

Hi all,

I have just spent my weekly half hour looking at my server's error
logs, trying to find failed retrievals that are caused by broken
links. Thanks to the CERN HTTPD's handy logging of Referer, and an
error-log summarising Perl script I ended up writing, this is
reasoneably effective. I fixed one local broken link, and mailed about
5 remote sites. Especially the latter is tedious; you have to make
time to write a message (even if that is also facilitated by a Perl
script :-), and you're fixing other people's mistakes (some of the
broken URLs never even existed!)

So I'm wondering if we're ever going to do something about this.  It
is obvious that many people (including myself) don't (want to) run
local link-cheking robots regularly enough. And the "offending"
servers don't know they're serving broken links unless they're local.
But that ought to change, IMHO.

Some random thoughts about this:

Idea 1: This could be changed by having clients that find a broken
URL send the offending server an HTTP/1.1 method BROKEN, with two
fields: URL (the broken URL) and Referer (the URL of the page with the
broken URL). A server can then log this, for later analysis by
humans/Perl scripts/whatever.  Obviously a client doesn't do this if
the user cancelled or the connection timed out, or if there is no
Referer.

This is an overhead for the user-agent (although it shouldn't be too
bad if it's asynchronous), but something might then be done about it,
which benefits the user-agent's user. 

A drawback is that the server may get many repeated notifications,
although this could be a feature (you know which broken links to
tackle first :-)

Idea 2: rather than the client implementing this, the server can do so
instead; when finding a failed URL it can initiated the BROKEN method
to the server found in the Referer (pity so many Referers lie). This
also reduces the repeats if a server remembers it has flagged a
particular error situation.

Introducing this means that servers unaware of this method will
complain , which isn't really a problem as any errors need not be
shown to the user.

The unfortunate thing is that it requires the servers administrator to
take action. This can be either finding the relevant user (easy if you
use a UserDir feature), or publishing the list for people to look at.
I'd be quite prepared to do this, and I'm sure a server or an log
analyszer can automate the process. But it would be better if the
actual maintainer of the document could automatically be notified.

Idea 3: send the repsonsible person's mail address in the http
request. The client can then mail automatically when it finds a broken
link, and the user can mail manually with other comments.  I don't
like that at all, as it relies on email, fills up your mailbox, and can
easily be abused.

Idea 4: Instead of sending an email address, send a URL that is to be
retrieved should the link be found broken. This can be a script that
either logs the event, or is clever enough to take another action.
This is a variant of Idea 1, but smells rather of a hack.

In all of the above special consideration has to be given to caches;
obviously a cached document can still be wrong if the original has
been rectified.

My favourite so far is number 2. 

Does anybody else think this should be addressed? Does anyone else
check their logs/would they check such a BROKEN log? Are there any
other/better solutions?

This topic came up quite a while ago, but I can't find it in the
archives (anyone have a search engine on the full www-talk archives?).
I thought the previous discussions ended up saying something like:  "you
need a submit button on the form, as you can't rely on the browser
submitting single-field forms when the user presses <return>".  And
I've always put submit buttons on my forms for this reason.

However, the HTML2.0 spec seems to say differently.

In http://www.hal.com/products/sw/olias/Build-html/YLgs0XBMCmF84aK.html:

   "When the form consists of a single text field, it may be appropriate
   to leave such buttons out and rely on the Enter key."

That URL doesn't look like a very stable one :-).  I got there from
ftp://halsoft.com/halsoft/olias/html-19940822/README.html then look at
the html version, then select 'forms and input fields'.

Lynx 2.3.8 doesn't support the use of <return> as a form submission
mechanism.  This seems like a very old question.  Who's wrong...the HTML
authors or the browser writers?  Or are they just both following
different standards.

have fun,
rik.

   Recently, I had an email exchange with a system administrator who gave
   data showing that using HTTP to serve an archive of data caused a
   higher load on the machine, even though the actual net traffic served
   was less.

   Does anybody have any data or first-hand experience to share? Does
   HTTP really fail to be lighter weight than FTP? Or did the above
   sys admin probably have a very atypical setup, or a misconfigured
   server?

   Dan

It makes quite a bit of difference what httpd the machine was running.
The NCSA server, in particular, has its notorious slow performance in
reading MIME headers.

FWIW, I got curious enough about where the time actually goes to do a
profiling run of the AI lab's (somewhat modified) NCSA server early
this afternoon.  The profile (based on a few hundred live requests
from actual clients --- the real world is its own best simulation) is
up as

  http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rst/profile.user_data

if people want to take a look.  Get_mime_headers() expense isn't as
high as it would be in a stock NCSA server (due to one of my hacks),
but it evidently still needs work; also, there are still other
candidates for trimming.  But look how little of it is in send_fd(),
the function which actually transfers data in almost all cases; even
getting the last-modified-time takes more user-mode cycles (due in
large part to all the locale stuff).

As a general comment, there are plenty of things a typical Web server
does on each connection, besides the fork(), which also take up
nontrivial amounts of CPU time, including DNS lookup of the client
(for logging and access control), trying to open every .htaccess file
which *might* be present, etc., etc. --- all of which is *in
principle* dispensable, and all of which burns server cycles.  For
instance, in the profile cited above, about 20% of the server's time
went into trying to open .htaccess files which are almost never
actually there.

At least some of this (the .htaccess stuff in particular) is often not
done by ftp servers, and certainly not done repeatedly.  (A typical
ftp session looks up the client's name *once* --- a web server, even
one that forks, could achieve the same effect by keeping a cache of
the last few hundred hostnames seen in a shared memory segment).  I
sometimes suspect this overhead collectively accounts for as much or
more CPU cycles as forking off the process in the first place, but I
have no hard data on the question.

I've been working on some of the tricky bits of the HTTP-NG negotiation 
mechanism (Dave's started nagging me again :-),  and one of the domains I've
been trying to dot the t's on deals with policy options. 

These policy controls were originally designed to benefit information 
providers- for example, many sub-licencees of databases are required in their
contracts to display copyright information provided by the real owner of the
database. They were also intended to control the storage and further 
distribution of copyrighted information. 

However, this kind of policy control can also be used to protect clients. 
For example, a user might wish to request that log information not be forwarded
to outside parties, or even between departments within a given organisation. 

Commercial sites might prefer to be able to use access information to assist in
consumer service; academic sites will tend to follow full ALA best practice. 

Having support for this kind of negotiation in the protocol seems useful to
me - it doesn't add much to the implementation, and does address some privacy
concerns.  

Are there any other policy areas that would benefit from protocol support- the
whole area  can get pretty murky pretty fast. Comments?

        How does this sort of negotiating in real-time work:

a. when the user is interacting with a caching server and not the 'owner'
of the data?

b. when the net is congested and each protocol-exchange suffers serious
latencies, thereby adding considerably to overall session "effort" and
time?

c. getting at the data through non-interactive, non-web means?  Do we get
to re-invent security mechanisms for each method of conveying the same
data?

        (Speech)  Any particular change to any particular protocol may well
be cheap to write in the spec and even cheap to write in the code.  But
what is the cost of supporting it, operationally, throughout the vagaries
of the Internet?

        (more speeh) Stating this differently:  I strongly advise against
the tendency to "put security into the protocol" namely http, and think
much harder about puting security around the data.  http-level mechanisms
can be VERY useful to determining the security required by the object, but
that is different from acturally having the security mechanism, itself, in
the protocol.

bwahaha -- I think the "tad out of date" message was from the author of
another excellent (largely-)text browser, Emacs/w3 (Bill Perry, now at
Spry).  w3 is renowned (in my book) for implementing every new feature as
soon as it is conceived -- it's probably the most up-to-date browser there
is.

The problem with that approach is that it tends to result in  
solutions which only address one problem, while a more  
forward-looking design could transform the same basic capability into  
a general enabling mechanism.  Standardization of overspecialized  
solutions will just hold back the Web.

Exactly...and look at WAIS for an even more poignant example of a  
useful, but complex and overspecialized protocol which is gradually  
being de-integrated, and will probably be used mainly through HTTP  
gateways in the long run.

The lesson I draw from this is that getting _any_ new protocol into  
browsers is going to be very difficult, unless it has a truly broad  
and diverse constituency.  What is the likelihood of a helper  
application being designed with a protocol that's more generally  
useful than Telnet or WAIS?  My guess, very low.

Competition may choose superior solutions, but it doesn't create  
them.  For that you need foresighted people.

  Well, the only other ones I know of that run on more than one OS are the
linemode browser (no forms support), and emacs-w3.  I think there is one
VMS specific browser, and one VM specific also, but I've never seen them.

  Emacs-w3 supports all of HTML 2.0, and the only things from HTML 3.0 not
implemented are the MATHs, and a few little things with the tables support
needs to be fixed before I release it for general consumption.  I also
threw in support for all of the netscape extensions, as well as a few put
out by the Pythia people, as documented on their web site.

  Emacs-w3 also runs under XWindows (with the ability to do inlined images
and mpegs if using Lucid Emacs or XEmacs), NeXTStep, Windows (3.x, Chicago,
and NT), VMS, Amiga, and OS/2.  It will also run on Macintosh and DOS in
local mode (I've heard rumors that it can now do networking on the
macintosh, but I haven't confirmed this yet - my access to Macs is rather
limited here at SPRY :).

   It has a persistent disk cache that has a few advantages over netscape -
no FAT file being one of the big wins.  It can also import a netscape cache
area into itws own format.  It is more along the lines of Arena's cache -
/tmp/$USER/http/com/spry/www/index.html, etc.  Can use netscape or XMosaic
global history lists, and XMosaic style hotlists.  Also the only browser I
know of that can handle a multipart MIME message (I had to write it in
order to view clari.feature.dilbert seamlessly :)

   Am currently working on basic style sheets, and will implement the rest
of HTML 3.0 as I find time on the weekends. :)

   Oh, and of course, since it is written in/for emacs, it is customizable
in the extreme, which can make it a bit arcane to set up, but I will be
writing some Tcl/Tk scripts (for X11/NT) (and a DLL for windows) soon that
will make this easier.

If the data is cached, and was provided by the originating server under 
the condition that logging information be provided to that originating 
server, then the caching server must request and require such logging 
privileges as required by that agreement.

[hey - real time networks don't get congested - otherwise ATM would have 
 a way of dealing with it :)]

Negotiations like this only cause extra-latency in the event of negotiation
failure- for example, if a server requires full third-party log communication
rights, and the client refuses to grant such rights. In all other cases, 
pipe-lining prevents the latency problem.

I'm not quite sure I understand this (or at least I'm missing the subtext).
If options relating to the disposition of logging requests and licence display
don't belong in the application layer, and given your advocacy of the 
traditional ARPA 5 layer model of networking (Physical-Link-Network-Transport-
Application), the only place to put such options would be in either TCP-NG or 
IP-NG. I know that IP-NG has lots of wasted bits in the address space, but it's 
a bit early to start overloading them for application semantics.

I'm not sure I understand this paragraph (and I'm sure that this time it's my 
fault). Could you explain a bit more about what you mean by 'security around
the data'.

How's the multilingual support?  I've been sitting on my hands for months,
waiting for the promised multilingual client support, so that I can put
some bibliographies and bilingual/multilingual dictionaries online.  The
bibliographies contains titles in languages than English, naturally (e.g.,
German, Arabic, Hebrew, French, etc.).

Not to say that you should be everyone's slave programmer.  What you've
done already is well worth commendation....

This isn't going to fly with the current Referer implementations.  Too 
many browsers lie, especially all the Mozillas which constitute over half 
the web clients currently.  Even if every version written from now on 
were accurate, the sheer number of liars deployed will results in too 
many false positives.  I get dozens of the MCOM home URL in my Referer 
logs on a daily basis.

There also needs to be a more reliable way of ascertaining the maintainer 
of a page.  There are a few machine heuristics and a few more human ones 
that can work, but no reliable method.  Even a ~user URL isn't 
guaranteed to be able to receive mail at the same machine.

I don't know if there's an easy answer to this, but I do think it's 
important that it be addressed.  The web, like the Internet, has maintained 
the cooperation model for a long time, but the influx of corporate users 
is high.  If a broken URL generates a noticeable number of errors to 
such a server, they may not be inclined to just patiently wait for it to get 
fixed.

I certainly hope we are going to do something about it. As the web gets larger
this problem is only going to get worse.

I currently run a spider about once a month on my server, but that doesn't
help when other servers are pointing at bits of my server that no-longer exist
(or never existed in the first place).

This is my favourite too. Additionally a REDIRECTED method would be useful
(this could even go so far as to perform an automatic correction :). Having a
separate broken links log would be really handy, save working through the
error file looking at all the "connection aborted" messages.

The main downside to this mechanism is that it won't cope with a link which
points to a server that doesn't exist.

I believe that in the long term we *have* to have some mechanism for finding
and correcting broken links.

There are a mass of such questions in the security field. In order to get a 
conviction for hacking it is usualy necessary to prove intent. Certainly with
the Web this is a big problem because it is impossible to prove that the person
who just read a page was not tricked into it.

Password and key protection does not help here. Consider the scenario where 
Mallet cracks secret@spook.com and attaches the key he has discovered to an
innocent bit of HTML puporting to be about flowers. Alice then follows this 
link and is arrested for hacking  :-(

What is needed is the ability to put up a warning notice when a person 
attempts to enter a site for the first time in a session [might be multiple
HTTP connections though, this is where the anon-session-id comes in]

The anaon session ID is simply a cryptographic (eg MD5) hash of a load of
garbage that produces a key specific to a particular browser session. Here
session would normally mean `running' the program but since this has no
usefull analogy in a persistent system session is better. 



If you object to jailing the blighters I suggest you forget about the cute n'
cuddly reports in the papers. In one case I was involved in the hacker first
sent out a barrage of insulting garbage from the stolen account [which was
not much of a problem], then tried to obtain large sums of money by deception
and finaly threatened a series of frivolous lawsuits. In between he harassed 
the famillies of a number of people trying to nab him.


For the log options I would suggest that the system be bassed on the MAC 
standards avaliable from the NSA. It should be possible to use the Web to track
the readership of various documents. This is not just a security issue. In
ISO-9000 there are a large number of documents which individuals must 
acknowledge reciept of >and reading< - The two arn't the same. Even having 
viewed a document does not mean I have read it, it would be very nice if my 
mail/newsreader allowed me to add documents into a "pending" file (watch
this space :-).

I think this is not so much of a problem:

- As Paul Burchard pointed out, Netscape is likely to be fixed RSN.
- WWW users are like little kids; they always want the latest browser,
  so upgrades propagate quite fast.
- In the specific case of the infamous NCOM home page it would result
  in lots of BROKEN notifications to their server, not your's :-)
- If the server also sends a 'By-User-Agent' field you could even 
  filter out broken useragents.
- A script can atually confirm the reported misses (by retrieving the
  page and scanning for the reportedly broken URL)
- If your documents have few broken links you won't have many
  notifications, and therefore few false positives.

I used to use Referer to make inverse maps. With the amount of lying
implementations I had to give that up. But I still successfully use
Referer when investingating broken links. Because few people do
anything with Referer there is little pressure to fix the bugs. If it
was used in the way I proposed this pressure would mount.

I think we have probably been too easy on browser writers, which may
stem from the time that they were written/maintained on a spare-time
best-effort basis. :-)

I really don't think we should be design the mechansim around broken
implementations. Fix the implementations.

My main concern with this is that you take the notification out of the
HTTP realm, and rely on external means of notification. These will be
more difficult to standardise and automate, even apart from the
difficulty of designing a solid method of identifying a user.

By keeping it in HTTP and between servers you can always add/change
this identification and notification process by changing how a server
handles it.

Quite. I'm starting to consider if retrieving a broken URL from my
server constitues acceptable use :-) It is especially infuriating if
you find broken URL's that you know have never ever worked.

No, I think that writing scripts like this is a bad habit to fall into. 
 Safe-Tcl's approach of asking the user before making filesystem changes is 
a Good Thing.


Fisher's Laws of Transmissable Agents:
1. An agent may not injure the computer system it runs on.

2. An agent must obey its programming except where such orders would 
conflict with the First Law.

3. An agent must protect its own existence as long as such protection does 
not conflict with the First or Second Law.

There should also be some thinking about the inevitability of processes
that create broken links and the need for some re-engineering to reduce
the effects of those processes.  

Right now, one of the great features of WWW is that a single copy of a
document is available to readers all over the world.  This is both a
feature and a bug.  The feature aspects are obvious.  The bug aspects
derive from the single point of failure that results.  So long as WWW
publishing is based upon authors providing acess to a single copy of a
document, WWW publishing will remain the electronic equivalent of "copies
of the manuscript are available from the author upon request."

Let's consider some numbers: 

 Let    N = the total number of WWW documents on the planet
        M = mean time between failure, in days (i.e., M = the number
            of days that the average WWW document remains accessible at
            the same URL)
        L = the average number of links pointing to a typical document

Then, on a typical day, the number of links that worked yesterday but that
don't today is given by N*(1-M)*L.  Put in some reasonable estimates for
the future, such as:

       N = 100,000,000
       M = 1,000
       L = 100

and the whole web experiences 10,000,000 new broken links every day.  And
these breaks are due only to the actual movement or loss of html docs on
their servers.  Typos as URLs propagate are ignored.

What's the point?  The point is that as WWW matures, we are likely to see
the emergence of "publishers" and "libraries" who provide the electronic
equivalent of some of the functionality provided by paper publishers and
libraries: stability of access.  As we endorse the power of electronic
publishing over paper publishing, let us not forget that there is a lot of
important functionality, not necessarily related to the use of paper,
embedded in the traditional publishing process. 

To obtain access to a copy of a published paper book, I contact new and
used bookstores and libraries.  If the book was published fairly recently
by a fairly large publisher, I can probably get access within a reasonable
amount of time.  The reference "Books in Print" is consulted to see if the
book is available from a publisher. If not, the local library or inter-
library loan can be used. 

Although these processes are currently related to paper publishing, they
are not absolutely wedded to the use of paper.  Instead, they represent
several layers of services and meta-services that assist readers access
publications.  This entire layer of infrastructure is almost wholly
lacking in the current Web world.  The "middlemen" in paper publishing do
not merely skim money while delaying the communication process.  Instead,
many provide truly important services.  

Some interesting technical challenges lie first in figuring out which of
those services need replicating (and improving) in the world of electronic
publishing, and then in implementing the solutions.

I've been testing this automatic correction idea for a while.  My server
does a fuzzy match of all the URLs on the site and returns a list of
close matches on a failed URL.  Such as:

http://www.eia.brad.ac.uk/rti/guid/indox.htlm  (=/rti/guide/index.html)
http://www.eia.brad.ac.uk/rtl/  (=/btl/ or /rti/)

Of course this only traps spelling mistakes and it requires an updated
table of contents of html documents.

A properly functioning cache should not be serving a document whose
original has been updated. In practice, depending on the guesswork
and arcane magic used to conjure up expiry dates, I suppose current caches
will serve them, so Martijn's concern is well placed.

BTW wasn't the point of LINK REV=made href="mailto:blah@site" so that
clients could notify the maker of a document if it had broken links?

I thought some browsers already did this - Lynx springs to mind.

Let's argue by analogy - that old favourite, "This is a searchable index"
does not have a submit button because it is not a form, it's an ISINDEX.

Thus, browsers must already be capable of accepting a typed in response and 
sending it off when the user completes some sort of trigger action, most 
likely pressing enter or return or local equivalent.

So, they should already have the code to  handle single field forms proided 
that a standard somewhere says that they should.

In the interests of fairness, a counter argument ;-)

Nothing says that the single field has to be a single line text entry. 
It could be a scribble input or a set of radiobuttons or whatever, so may 
not be able to accept keyboard input at all. It may be a text field 
with multiple lines - not so great if you are typing in your 
address and it sends off the form with only your street name completed!
Anyone proposing hacks such as "a dot on a line by itself", forget it  $:-)

Thus, the standard should be ammended to say that all forms must have 
a submit button, but that for the case where a form consists solely of a
single line text entry field, that pressing return may be considerd 
equivalent to selecting submit.

I' not sure it is good enough:

- nobody uses it (but everyone uses a server)
- it requires email support
- either it requires manual action, or has to be implemented
  in every client.
- it can be great fun if someone copies my document with errors,
  but never corrects them when I do.
- it can be so easily abused: <HEAD><LINK REV=made

One browswer I use, Netscape, supports this feature - but... the forms I 
build require the submit button to be named as I rely on the value of the 
button to determine what action to take within my CGI script  (the script 
is general purpose and would normally be invoked from a form with multiple 
buttons, but it's easy to envision only requiring one).  In this scenario, 
pressing Enter is not the same (in Netscape anyway) as pressing the sole 
submit button.  The submit occurs, but the POST data is not loaded with the 
value of my button.

Would ACTION attribute(s) on the buttons themselves and/or on the text 
fields help?  I'm not deep into the DTD side of HTML so if this is 
incredibly off base just ignore...

Without going into too much detail, I have a working prototype here at
IBM which exploits DB2 databases through an OS/2 system running a web (httpd)
server.

This extension/gateway allows any browser (such as WebExplorer on OS/2, MOSAIC,
or "Mozilla") to query data residing on DB2 databases on various operating
systems.  After retrieving the data, we permit display of the data in
various graph formats - ie. pie charts, column charts etc.  This is all
done from the server end, with no modification of the browser.  The created
charts are imbedded as bitmaps within HTML documents via the <img> tag.

If one uses a good browser, such as the WebExplorer on OS/2 Warp, one
can then imbed the bitmaps into their documents.

Sorry if I am disturbing you.
I would like to know if is possible to have more color (no only blue)
in the text in a page, that was written in HTML.

Five nice graphs are waiting for you. Some of the texts are in French,

Sounds really neat!  Unfortunately (or not ;), I don't know of 
any DB2 databases that I need to access.  Two comments on the

1.  You neglected to say, but I would assume:  this will be a

2.  This subject would actually be more appropriate on the

Not sure if this is the right place to ask... but here goes...

I thought I saw at one time, inline text SIZE being altered, much the same way
you would alter the weight or slant using <strong> or <em> tags. But I seem to
remember it being done by means of an escape sequence (i.e. &mumble;).
Can this be done? Can I change the font size of inlined (not header) text?

thanks,

[sorry if this gets repeated, the mail failed twice before]

Hi all,

I had an idea the other day to improve searching on the web. 
There are many search engines on the web which will return a 
list of links to documents containing a search keyword. The
search engine then either

1) expects you to find the keyword after following the link 
  or
2) processes the document, highlighting and anchoring the keyword
 to make it visible to the user. i.e. they create a new 
 document on the fly.

Both these methods have drawbacks. 1) is obvious; the user has
to do another search within the document to find the keyword. 2)
has the drawback of requiring some nifty programming to highlight
and anchor any part of a HTML document (I've tried this - there are
lots of annoying special cases to catch you out). It also adds 
to the load of the server.

The idea I propose is to allow URLs to contain a search keyword for
client-side searching. Most browsers allow you to search a document
for strings.

So here's how it could work..

http://my.server.edu/some/url/path/document#/jump

would have the browser load the URL,
                       look for an anchor named "/jump"
                                         (for backwards compatibilty)
                       else search for "jump", scroll to it and highlight it

If the use of "/"  is undesirable, simply find another notation.

As well as providing a neat way for providers to enhance or simplfy their 
search engines, Joe Public will be able to setup links to other people's 
pages and define 'virtual anchors'. How often do you connect to a page
then always scroll down to the link or info you want ? - doing the
search visually.

Being a client side feature, the extra work is performed (where it should
be) on the users machine. Most browsers are already capable of searching
for and displaying search strings, so implementation should be very
simple. 

Browsers which don't support this feature would continue to work as
normal - they would just ignore an anchor name they cannot find.


So, is anyone from the HTML standards committee out there ?
If not where should I send this proposal ?

regards,
rob

I wanted to add my $.02 on this one in regards to implementing a way to jump
to the middle of the document.  I have been trying to do something along a 
similar vein so I think it might be relevant to bring up a few isues I've run
into.

I agree that there needs to be some srt of mechanism for jumping ot the middle 
of a document and the client could add a table of virtual <a name=""></a> anchors
or something on their side, but the real problem here (especially if you're talking
about allowing scripts to do this) is the decision that was made in committee a
while back to use the "#" token as a way of specifying a point within a file from
a URL.

I am currently trying to create an imagemap that jumps to one document, but will
go to a different place in the same document depending on which rect, poly, etc
the user clicks on.  What I've found is that when trying to specify the location
within the file to jump to with "#" it is treated as a comment and the rest of the 
line is ignored so half my URL gets chopped off.  This is not only a problem for
imagemap files, but any scripting language (like Perl, csh, and a host of others)
that uses "#" as a comment initiator token.  I strongly suggest that the HTML spec
be modified to replace the token with something a little more innocuous.  "^" 
perhaps?

If anyone has a solution to the imagemap problem I would really appreciate hearing 
from you!

Before I start replying to Martijn's comments, I should note that there
exists an IETF working group (Quality Information Services -- quis) that
is attempting to investigate problems with links and how these problems
can be solved.  However, the group lacks someone with enough initiative,
experience, and (above all) free time to investigate these problems and
come up with some specific and reasonable solutions.  If anyone reading
this message is really interested in this topic, I strongly encourage
you to join that group.  Info about QUIS can be obtained at:
<http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/html.charters/quis-charter.html> and
<http://naic.nasa.gov/naic/archives/quality/>.

What is most needed right now is a taxonomy of link problems and
problem sources.  It is difficult for people to understand the scope
of these issues without laying out a detailed taxonomy.  Although I
have one inside my head, I just haven't found the time to write it out
and fill in the holes.

Maybe. I spent a great deal of time thinking about this problem, and
the fact is that a broken link is not always a "real" problem.  Furthermore,
an protocol-level, automated notification system is almost never desirable --
there is simply no way to be accurate-enough in targeting the notification
to prevent the notification system itself from being worse than the broken
link.

There is also a significant difference between proactive maintenance
of links (via a tool like MOMspider) and reactive maintenance of links.
Proactive maintenance requires some form of traversal tool.  Reactive
maintenance can be performed via accurate error-log reporting and analysis.
However, in both cases, some human inspection of the problem is required
before a (possibly computer-assisted) notification can be sent.

Even after the problem has been identified, it is difficult to ascertain
who (or what) should be notified.  Quite often the mailing address of
whom to notify is not on the Referer: page itself, but on some page above it.
Sometimes the notification address is also in error (or obsolete).
Most importantly, however, there are issues of scale -- if notification
is sent on every bad request, a popular link may result in several thousand
notifications in just one day.  If the "problem" is just a temporary NFS
error local to the server's site, the maintainer is faced with several
thousand false alarms.

For example, the following problem occurred on my server this month.
All ICS undergrads in our department have a user account on our network
of Sun servers/workstations.  These accounts (if the proper permissions
are applied and a special subdirectory is created) are accessible via the
ICS webserver.  Thus, each undergrad can build their own webspace, without
any interference from me (the ICS webmaster).  

Unfortunately, these are not permanent accounts -- they expire six months
after an undergrad leaves the University (preferably by graduating) -- and
the beginning of this month just happens to be six months after the first
web-conscious graduating class up-and-left.  Now, for most individuals, 
this was no big deal, since their personal webspaces were taken down long
ago and they were not very interesting anyway.  However, one individual
not only had stuff worth linking to, but he had the unfortunate habit
of advertizing his stuff to every meta-index web in the known universe.

Naturally, he didn't tell me he graduated, and thus I had no opportunity
to move his worthwhile stuff to some better location and redirect the 
requests before his account got zeroed-out.  One day it was a perfectly
good link, the next it resulted in several thousand error_log messages.
Similarly, it would not have done any good for the owner's email address
to be advertized with the link -- his e-mail account was equally dead.

So, what we have here is a broken link *because* the resource is permanently
no longer available (as opposed to never was available, available at some
other location, temporarily unavailable, temporarily moved, permanently
moved, etc.).  Any notification that I send out should include the reason --
after all, I am asking the owner of the link to do us a favor by permanently
removing the link.

Before sending notifications, however, I needed to find the Referers.
Now, if I had more free time, I'd add the logic to my NCSA httpd server
to add more info to the error_log file.  Instead, I just added a redirect

  Redirect /~lsanchez http://www.ics.uci.edu/cgi-bin/gone

and wrote a quick perl cgi hack that sent a nice message to the user
that the resource was no longer available, while at the same time recording
the REFERER, REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_ADDR, REMOTE_USER, PATH_INFO, PATH_TRANSLATED,
and HTTP_USER_AGENT (I wasn't sure exactly what I would need).

The next day, I sorted through the output and found 6 unique Referers at
four different sites (some meta-indexes had multiple links).  Note that
these six references are several orders of magnitude less than the number
of broken link traversals that occurred (many of which had invalid Referers).
I then turned off the logging portion of the script -- users still get a
polite message, but I'm a little low on disk space at the moment.

I used XMosaic to visit those sites, wandered around until I found the
correct e-mail address for fixes, and then sent off a short message to
that address (I could have automated this further, but it was easier to
just cut-n-paste).  Over the course of the following week, I received
responses from the maintainers of those sites indicating that they had
removed the links, along with thanks for reporting it to them.  I don't
think they would have been quite so thankful if I caused several thousand
automatic notifications to be sent their way.

So, that's my most-recent experience.  Now, how does it stack up to Martijn's
list of random thoughts...

Well, assuming that the link was valid up-to-the-path (i.e. the scheme
and server name were correct in the otherwise bad link), this information
could have easily been recorded in the server's error log upon the first
request (and thus there is no need for a second one).  Worse, if the scheme
or server name were incorrect, you've just doubled the number of invalid
requests.

And if the error is only a temporary problem?  Sections of my server go
down several times a month (sometimes on purpose ;-) -- I don't want all
references to my site being removed because of a 1% downtime problem.

Even if this idea is desirable, it would make more sense for a separate
program to be sending the BROKEN method based upon the contents of a logfile.
In fact, it would be trivial to write such a program using libwww-perl.
In this way, a live human could be queried before the message is sent,
and the user could see whether or not the message was accepted.  In general,
I think its a bad idea to make origin servers also perform client actions.

Hmmmmmmmm....I bet you could write such a script faster than I wrote
this message.

Yep, a total disaster due to the problems of scale, privacy, excess junk
in every request, and the minor problem of knowing who is the responsible
person in the first place.

Again, if you got to the right server in the first place (and they care
enough to want this information), the error log already contains the
relevant information.

Yes, though it is likely that the time between notifying the owner and
the owner fixing the original will be much greater than the time between
changed original and updated cache.

Now, if I only had the time, we could work-up a solution and implement it.
However, it would still only be a partial solution, since reactive
maintenance can only go so far.  But then, if I had the time, I'd implement
SuperMOM and solve all the problems at once.  ;-)

Sounds like a good idea. If done, we should support a syntax that
has multiple keywords: http://x.edu/xxx#/jump,link,hypertext

Could you explain exactly what you mean by lying 
browsers?  Are they putting incorrect URLs into 
the Referer field, or places the user hasn't 
actually been to, or what?

How widespread is this?  What other browsers lie?

We've been thinking about tracking Referer fields 
to see where people are coming into GNN, and where 
they come from.  It sounds like that may not end up 
to be as useful as I thought.

For many months now, we've used the <LINK> tag in 
all GNN documents.  The main reason was because the 
Lynx browser used to (maybe still does?) check for 
broken links, and reports these errors by email to 
the maintainer of the document containing the bad 
links.  The tricky part was that unless otherwise 
specified, the errors would go to the maintainers 
of Lynx (hi, Lou!), *not* GNN.  Adding a tag like:

  <LINK REV=MADE HREF="mailto:johnl@ora.com">
 
caused the errors to be mailed to whoever was
specified in the HREF attribute.

This seems to have fixed the problem (at least we're 
not hearing from the Lynx folks ;), but still has 
some problems:

  - the errors were formatted to be readable 
    by humans, which makes tracking and 
    automation difficult

  - at least in the case of Lynx, apparent
    network problems were sometimes classified 
    as bad links; so we ignore the 'bad link' 
    messages that refer to, say, http://info.cern.ch ;)

In a related problem, I've noticed that our error 
logs are sometimes filled with URL requests for a 
document that really doesn't exist in GNN, but is 
close.  For instance, /gnn/gnnhome.html is *probably* 
GNNhome.html, our home page.  

I'd guess that these are from people typing in URLs 
from newspaper articles or other print media.

It seems silly to simply return a 404 error for these.  
I've thought about hacking the server to instead bring 
up a nicer page that says, in effect, 'Sorry, you've 
dialed a wrong URL.  Perhaps you mean one of these...'

Has anyone experimented with a more user friendly
approach to handling errors like this?  With the right 
interface, perhaps there could be a button that says 
'Report this URL as a bad link,' which could then link 
to a CGI script that could catalog the bad link.

There is a constant battle between people who want HTML to remain true
to the SGML "idea" and those that want to turn it into a variant of X
and/or TeX.  To specify colors is contrary to the spirit of HTML as a
kind of SGML.  The idea is that if we let people get down to minute
rendering details with HTML, it will no longer be a one-size-for-all
system, and it will no longer be easy to write and manipulate.

Just some thoughts.

Do you mean, look for "jump", but if you can't find it try "link",
then "hypertext" ? sounds reasonable.

If not, you might be complicating a simple idea.

gurp...ignore that paragraph.  My objection should have been the same
as for #2, i.e.  I don't want a server to be notified if the problem is
just a temporary glitch at my site.

Mozilla has a bug, it sends a referer field even when the
user types in the URL or selects it from a bookmark etc.
Whatever the user was looking at before doing this, is sent
as the referer.

Ncom know about the bug, and will presumably fix it for 1.1

We kicked this idea around a bit a couple of months ago.  It's one that
we've discussed a bit with Spyglass, too, as part of the work that we're
doing with them.

There are a couple of related capabilities that might be taken into account
when designing the syntax.  When dealing with large documents, retrieving
only a portion around the highlighted words.  In Acrobat docs, Adobe is
providing the means to retrieve one page at a time, for example.  Thus, you
could request the first page on which a highlight occurs.

In structured text, especially HTML, I suspect that nabbing a cohesive part
of the document while preserving the structure is a bit trickier, but
certainly worthwhile.

Finally, we'd also like to see browsers implement highlight-to-highlight
navigation.

HOWEVER... it has been pointed out by wiser minds that a proxy could
accomplish these things rather neatly.  To wit, if the search server would
send the highlighting information and URL, then the proxy could go get the
document, highlight it and send it along to the client.

But wait, there's more.  Instead of trying to pass all of this stuff in
URLs, which would become quite unwieldy, another suggestion was to create a
MIME type that would take care of these issues.  It would contain the
highlights, etc., and either the document itself or a pointer (URL) to it.

The MIME document could be expanded into the highlighted document by the
server, a proxy or the client.

Finally, since there's a need to support multiple viewers, this should be
implemented in a way that will work with more than just Web browsers.

Nick

I agree.  Leaving color specifications out of HTML lets the end user
pick the colors with the browser.  That's one of the great things about
the web.

A properly functioning cache should not be serving a document whose
original has been updated. In practice, depending on the guesswork
and arcane magic used to conjure up expiry dates, I suppose current caches
will serve them, so Martijn's concern is well placed.

BTW wasn't the point of LINK REV=made href="mailto:blah@site" so that
clients could notify the maker of a document if it had broken links?

I thought some browsers already did this - Lynx springs to mind.

Hello,

The intrinsic solution to the problem can be directly addressed via
the use of intelligent publishing environments [1] in tandem
with location independent naming schemes, e.g. URN [2].

I haven't had this tantrum in public for a while, so this seems like a 
good time. :=).

This isn't just about purity and aesthetics, and it isn't simply about 
simplicity.  HTML lets the author specify that she wants EMPHASIS, and 
the viewer decide how emphasis should be represented.  If we let the 
author decide that emphasis should be shown by using red characters 
then people who can't see red, because their terminals can't display it 
or their eyes can't see it, are lost.

Electronic presentation is a godsend to people with visual  handicaps 
exactly because they can manipulate how things are displayed in ways 
that can compensate for their particular limitations.  The more the 
author/publisher controls the less chance we have of being able to do 
this.

We're in a cultural phase right now where publishers are overcome by 
all the cute tricks their new tools will let them do, and are convinced 
that absolute control is crucial to the aesthetics of their 
publications.  Thus our newsstands are filled with magazines like 
"Wired" that I physically cannot read.  Even the text, which seems to 
always be in cute colors on cute backgrounds.  The careful distinction 
between structure and presentation is our defense.

I agree with you that fine-level control by _providers_ of color is not
appropriate in HTML (except as suggestions through stylesheets).  However,
I think _users_ should have some control, at the element level.  For instance:
<H1> is big text and Red
<em> is yellow, instead of italics
The normal text is blue

I believe some browsers, such as WinWeb, support this now.

I like the idea of being able to point into the middle of a document without
having to edit the document.  If used properly, it would encourage usefully
rich hypertext, since following a link could take you to relevant content, not
just a page that contains relevant content somewhere.

However, just allowing a word (or list of words) will break down pretty
quickly.  Some examples of functionality I would want (with a bad example
syntax):

 - n'th occurrence of a word (e.g. http://x.edu/xxx#/3:cheese)
 - occurrence of a word in a header (e.g. http://x.edu/xxx#/H2:cheese)

Also, for the case of a search engine returning results, I would want what I
think Dave H. is suggesting - the ability to highlight a whole list of terms
in the returned document, and easily navigate between them.  (For instance,
with a "Next Relevant Region" button.)

I seem to remember that HyTime has a syntax for doing things like this - does
anyone know more about that?

BTW - if addressing all of these issues gets too messy, I still like the idea
of being able to navigate to the first occurrence of a particular word.  It
addresses some of the needs, just not all of them.

I'd like to add my 2 cents to this.

I had written a perl script which reads the Referer fields that I log
(mod'd NCSA httpd) and matches a list of regular expressions against each
request.  This is slow.  After building a list of Referer URLs to try, it
uses the perl libwww routines to fetch them and then checks the links that
was found on that page if any of the above regular expressions match.  This
more or less fits Martijn Koster's ideas #2 & 3, and is I think roughly what
Roy Fielding is talking about.

After fetching the page, it reads the page for any links that match the
given regular expressions, and then it tries to figure out who to send
warning/notice mail to.  This is done by looking for 'link rev=made',
'reply-to' fields, RCS strings, whether the URL is of the form
/user/$username, then tries to pick out an email address in the final 256
bytes of the page.  As a last resort, tries webmaster, postmaster, and root
on the remote server.  One mail message per email address, so no mail
bombs.  VRFYs are done to the sendmail daemon, so hopefully no bounces
either.

By fetching the URL and doing analysis on the referring page, this avoids
bogus messages due to faulty Referer implementations on clients.  Of
course, my 'algorithm' could always guess wrong anyways.  Yes, it's just
trying to make an educated guess.

Please note that I'm not trying to say that this is an optimal solution;
or anything more than just a hack.  It is just an attempt to try to give
other people some advance warning, and save myself the effort of picking
through my server logs and compose mail messages.

I don't think this will allow third parties to setup links to
point at a document with a highlight. This feature would probably
be very popular.

This might be a separate problem, that of getting browsers to pass
the current URL on to viewers which could make use of them. Another
reasonably simple browser feature which has sadly been ignored so far.

Sorry to bother the list with that kind of question but the listserv
stuff kinda confusing to read and the comp.infosystems.www FAQ
doesn't say anything about this list...

Is there any usenet group mirroring this list ?

No, implied AND not OR. To keep it simpler, we can limit the semantic 
to multiple terms that should be treated equally by the client software. 
It would be up the search or other server software to create a list
of terms. This should avoid the issue of true query syntax.

An Nick points out, there should also be a change in proxy behavior.
And, the highlight to highlight client application jump would 
make the whole thing a lot more useful.

Dave Hollander

This brings up a discussion on multiple "piece-of-a-document" type
containers. A "sub-body" tag could be defined to be a complete transport
entity that does not inherit behavior from its siblings.  Indeed,  
style sheets and partial reveal strategies of most newer browsers
this might make this ability real handy.

It also would make those of us who maintain a "file per URL" happy. Multiple
documents could be maintained in one file and yet delivered in multiple
"virtual pages".

This type of "virtual page"/sub-body approach has been implemented in 
the SDL dtd and seems to work out quite well.

Help!  I have tried to unscribe but the volume keeps increasing!
What am I missing?  Is there a Usenet group where the same info

Thank you...excuse the mass distribution but my attempts to un-

Ok, now I see. So the list of words would be ignored by a 
dumb client, an intelligent client would point you at the first occurrence
of one of the words, and a really smart client would highlight all 
occurrences of all the words and allow you do move freely between them.

I don't want to see this idea fizzle away as just another idea, so
how does one go about getting it accepted or implemented ? (Ncom ?)

Feature request of the day: I wish NetScape, Mosaic, et. al had the
feature available in lynx, the original NeXT browser, and I believe the
emacs w3 browser; that is, to inspect a link without traversing it.

In Netscape/Mosaic, if I see a link to the document that I want to
tell my friend about, I have to either traverse the link and copy the
address out of the "current document address" text field (which may
take more time than I'm interested in, or worse: if it's a postscript
document, this approach won't work at all) or I have to do "view source"
and copy the address out of there (which might be a relative link, in
which case I have to do some surgery to come up with the absolute link.)


Another nifty feature: I'd like to be able to select a range of text
in some funky way (say control-drag) so that when I paste it, I get a
bunch of "meta-information" (e.g. the stuff in the NetScape Document
Information dialog) with it -- maybe shift-control-drag gives me an
HTML version; suppose I select the string "You can use this page to
send us comments, feature requests, bug reports, and general
feedback." on the mcom request page. When I paste it, I want to get:

	<blockquote>
	<p> You can use this page to send us comments, feature
	requests, bug reports, and general feedback.

	<address>
	<cite><a href="http://home.mcom.com/home/how-to-give-feedback.html">

	</address>
	</blockquote>


By the way... the ASHE editor is kinda neat: not rocket science, but
pretty nifty. I wish it had a more direct-manipulation interface for
making links. For example: select some text in a browser; highlight
some text in the ASHE window; "paste link". I'm sure some variation on
this could be hacked in in about an hour. With cooperation from
browsers (to support other X Selection targets besides STRING, like
URL and Last-Modified, and TITLE), it could be even nicer.

I like the general idea of coming up with a well defined set of
extensions for the "#xxxxx" part of uniform resource identifiers, for
pointing to not only HTML tags, search strings in text/* documents,
image coordinates, etc.

I'm sure there are contexts for which there's too much to push inside
the URL, but since we have the URL syntax, lets think about what the
general facilities need to be.

I support the notion of multiple-parallel search terms. You need to
deal with both multiple search terms, and different hits on the
same (original) search term, eg. through stemming, truncation, etc.

In Hyper-G[1] and prospero[2], the links are maintained much less by
hand, and much more by the machine. Prospero employs a notion of "time
to live" for links, so that stale links just go away after some time
(I think).

I expect that over time, link addresses will be maintained
independently from document content; I'm not sure if HTML will change
to accomodate this, or if document content and addresses will be
"merged" into the current HTML format on the server side.

I am seeing more and more motivation to maintain links separate from
content all the time...

I don't have time to look into the details right now, but folks cooking
up solutions would do well to investigate those systems.

It sure does. HyTime has about 27 different ways to refer to pieces of
text in a document. After studying them, it looks to me like somebody
just wrote down 27 different features, and made no attempt to find a
general, extensible mechanism based on a few well-chosen primitives.

For example, you can address "norms" -- space separated "names" --
kinda like C identifiers "numbers" -- sequences of digits. But they
didn't just go ahead and say "you can refer to character sequences
defined by a regular expression."

And the syntax for doing it is verbose, messy, and tied to SGML.

Oh... except for HyQ, the hytime query language. It's not SGML, and
it's not lisp s-expressions, or anything else simple and
powerful. It's a bunch of cryptic little words (why such fear of the
eight character boundary?) and ill-defined semantics.

Somebody spent a LOT of time cooking up the HyTime standard. I once
believed at one time that there were some powerful, novel features in
there somewhere that got bogged down by SGML syntax and the
international standards process. But as I look at it closely, it just
looks like a bunch of folks wrote down their 9 favorite mechanisms for
each problem. Little attempt to abstract, generalize, or simplify is
apparent. Proponents seems to say "HyperMedia is complex. No simple
system will work. It _has_ to be this complex, arbitrary, and
ill-specified."

Arguments to the contrary, as usual, are welcome.


>BTW - if addressing all of these issues gets too messy, I still like the idea

I heartily agree. In fact, this feature was requested a long time ago.
The proposed syntax back then was

	scheme:path#!string

which I believe would have fewer backwards-compatibility problems than
path#/string.

This is a proposal whose value clearly outwieghs its cost of
deployment. I'm for it. As TimBL said one time, it's a "downhill
step."

I'm sure the Mosaic 2.4 source code can be patched to support this in
about an hour. Anybody have the free hour? Has this already been done?

I too would like to see fully general, recursive, powerful, indirect,
secure, replicated, ... reference mechanisms. Anybody with

	* a complete proposal
	* user documentation
	* robust sample implementation that integrates
		easily with existing clients

is encouraged to speak up!

In the mean time, let's do #! (or #* or whatever) (and SimpleMD5
authentication!) and take one step forward.

I think the best bet would be to persuade a company that does search tools
to come up with a concrete proposal and, ideally, a sample implementation.
It would be great if this company were a member of the W3 Consortium and
already working with one or more server, browser and viewer developers to
integrate search engine.

In other words, Verity really should step up to the plate here.  I will
make enquiries at the engineering end of the office, where these
discussions are being monitored.

I suspect that if we could drag a proxy server developer into the thicket
with us, we could see quicker results, since it'll be quicker to deploy
first in a proxy than in clients.  Volunteers?

We are rather intrigued by the possibilities for a proxy server with our
agent technology in it.

I am trying to get as many browsers as possible to support a simple 
one-entry fill-in form. So far, I have been using <ISINDEX> to indicate I 
want a return, and it's been working fine.

However, we're starting to get some complaints from users of certain 
browsers (MacWeb is one) that the place to type in to isn't obvious.

Is it true there are ISINDEX-supporting browsers that don't make it clear 
how to do the search?  Is it true that a sufficiently large percentage of 
browsers (98%+, say) support forms so this really isn't an issue any more?

Thanks!    --Darren

Except for local news hierarchies (cern.www.talk, hal.mlist.www-talk),
no there's no newsgroup in "the big seven" hierarchies that mirrors
this list.

<rant> (but I'll try to stay positive.)

I hope it stays that way. Currently, folks have to do at least a
_little_ digging around and investigating before they find this list.

I think that's a good thing. I think folks should exhaust the
resources available to them before making requests of others. Folks
should find and read the Boutell's excellent WWW FAQ, the documentation
for their browser, the documentation for their server, etc., as well
as contacting their local system administrator before sending mail
to this list.

(Does the subscription acknowledgement message sent out by the
mail robot for this list tell folks about such resources?)

I actually get long-distance phone calls from folks wanting to know
how to do stuff like transparent gifs and server-side includes. Go
figure.

What I would like to know is how those folks got so far as to know
that they need to do transparent gifs and server-side includes without
finding out about things like the FAQ archive at ftp://rtfm.mit.edu,
let alone the documentation for the software they use (their browser,
and if they're authoring, their server.)

I have some clues: for example, the old newsreaders like rn and such
would try to scare the pee out of you if you tried to actually post
something to usenet. Are you sure? Do you realize you're using
bandwidth and diskspace on machines all over the world? Have you
spell-checked your post? Are you familiar with USENET posting rules?
(and you had to type YES, not just y, and you had to do it in
upper-case. You had to pay attention.)

In contrast, Netscape lets you post with one click of a button. Not so
much as an "are you sure" dialog with a link to USENET lore. No check
to make sure that your original text is larger than the text you're
quoting. I understand that the America Online news interface barely
distinguishes between replying by mail and posting a followup.


It's a good thing that a web browser can give you point-and-click
access to the vast resources of the internet. It would be even better
if that same interface to those resources would make some attempt to
familiarize users with the rules and guidelines for using those
resources.

AIR Mosaic can do this, too... hold down Control-Shift while clicking on the

I'll second that.

The WN server does a server-side interpretation of URL parameters,

    /dir/foo.txt;lines=10-20
		^

would be interpreted as a requiest for lines 10-20 of "foo.txt".
(See <URL:http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/range.html>).

Perhaps a similar syntax would be appropriate for client-side
interpretation of URL fragment identifiers:

    http://foo.com/dir/foo.txt#lines=10-20
			      ^

The presence or absense of an '=' sign in the fragment would
determine whether the fragment is an extended locator
or an anchor name (or element ID in HTML 3).

Whatever syntax is chosen, it should be extensible.
There are lots of possibilities:

    foo.txt#lines=10-20  		-- highlight lines 10 through 20
    foo.html#textsearch=radioactivity	-- first (or all) occurrences of phrase
    foo.html#teipath=P+3+EM+1 		-- first <EM> in 3d <P>
    foo.html#treeloc=1,5,3		-- HyTime treeloc location
    foo.html#nameloc=anchor1		-- same as foo.html#anchor1

Text searches and TEI-style paths would be most useful.

For example, you can't give a short answer to a longer question that

I prefer this syntax as well -- it is both clearer and
more extensible than using a special character to indicate each
possible use for a fragment.

Hmmm... I'm leery of anything so complex that a proxy server is required.

Proxy servers that do nifty searching things can be a good thing, but
let's not let that complicate this simple proposal.

Much of my trepidation is in that the proxy server would have to alter
the document between the original server and the client; hence, it's
not "transparent" to the protocol. This would be a dangerous precedent.
And it interacts very badly with security techniques such as digital
signatures (not to mention encryption!).


Three cheers for Verity engieers spending time to design a solution,
though!


Hmmm... thinking about it a little the first features I think we
should provide are the features that browsers like pg, more, less
provide: search for this string (perhaps regexp), and go to line
N. (but how do you define line N in html? It would have to be line N
of the source -- not the rendered document, I suppose.)

The first feature I'm interested in is the ability to link to some
point in a document that I can't/don't want to write to (or is not an
HTML document).

The ability to highlight/navigate search hits is something else... is
it really necessary, given that WWW documents are typically small
chunks, rather than long flows? I suppose in some cases it is.

Would the ability to specify a regexp cut it? e.g. suppose there
was a keyword search for frogs, dogs, and pigs, and all three
keywords were found in http://foo.com/filex.html. The search
results page might say:

	<a href="http://foo.com/filex.html#!((frog)s?|(dog)s?|(pig)s?)">
	On the nature of Animals</a>

(note my attempt to represent stemming).

At a mininum, the browser would just find the first match of that
regexp and scroll to there. A fancier browser might highlight all
matches and allow you to navigate between them with next/previous
match buttons. Well... at a bare minimum, the browser would do
the current thing: look for <a name="((frog..."> and fail to find it.
(Didya know netscape leaves you scrolled to the _bottom_ of the
page in this case?)

Folkd would have to be careful to backslash their .'s, and to %XX-ify
/'s and such. It could get messy. But it's doable!

Are POSIX regexp libraries widely available? Are they part of MS/Mac
development environments, or can the freely available implementations
be ported?

Actually the WN server does quite a bit more in the way of server
side implementations of the ideas in this thread.

	/dir/foo;bytes=111-200

will return bytes 111-200 of any file foo.  There are lots of interesting
things one can do with this. (Before you ask, a range from an HTML document
is returned as text/plain.)

But the thing that is close to what is being discussed here is

	/dir/foo.html;mark=71,22,30#WN_mark

This returns file foo.html with a tag like <a name=WN_mark>xxxxxxx</a>
surrounding bytes 22-30 of line 71, so that the browser goes to the 
correct line and highlights the selected bytes.  (It's a little more
complicated than this if the bytes are inside an anchor).

This is used for full text searches of multi-file HTML documents which
return lists of all the lines with a match with matching words highlighted
and linked to their location in the document.  The search is done by
the server (there is no way for the client to search the multiple files
of the document) and the list of matches is constructed on the fly.

To see this in ACTION take a look at the index to the HTML 2.0 
Specification which is at

    <http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/html2.0/docindex.html>

and look up an index item like ACTION.

I think a client side mechanism like this to mark the first occurence
of a particular pattern is a great idea.  It has some advantages and
some disadvantages over a server side version like the one in WN.

The big advantage is that clients already have canonicalized the text
for searching so you don't have to worry about what to do it the match
is in an anchor or in a tag, or *is* a tag.

A client side limitation is that I don't know a good way to return
*all* the matches for a pattern in a document.  But that might
be doable.  A more serious limitation is there is no good way to
search multiple files in a single conceptual HTML document.  And that is
what the user really wants to do.  This is something that I think
WN handles well.

I'm working on linking some PC network resources through HTML links and
would like to know the best way to go about referencing these network
drives.

What I thought of doing was writing a DOS batch file to neatly access the
resource, but I need some way of getting my Web browser to understand that
the appropriate link is not going to a text document but should execute a
program/batch file instead. At the most basic level, I need to shell out
from my browser to DOS (I'm using Netscape for Windows).

Is this just a fanciful idea that really should be implemented, or is there
anyway to do this sort of thing?

Thanks in advance.

The original proposal, which has been refined through suggestions here,
doesn't require implementation on all browsers. Browsers which support
it will be more attractive than those which don't. Browsers choosing
not to implemement it will continue to work, just not as effectively
as those which do implement it. The "daunting political task" seems
to be happening right now, and appears to be running smoothly.

To recap the current state of the suggestions as I understand them is..
Opting initially to get just the basics of the idea implemented, we'll
use the anchor character "#" (for backwards compatibility), followed by a
special character or word, "!" or "find" (or whatever), followed by an
"=", then a keyword or comma separated list of keywords,

  e.g.

  http://x.y.z/abc#find=dog
  or
  http://x.y.z/abc#find=dog,cat,pig

Browsers can choose to implement the search in whatever way they like,
the simplest could be to look for "dog" - ignoring "cat" and "pig".
In the best implementation, the browser would find all occurrences of all
the words and allow the user to move freely from one to another. 

The use of "find=" will allow other types of client side (or server side,
if appropriate) features to be added as and when they are proposed and
agreed upon. e.g. if someone wants regular expressions then "reg=" might
be used.

Yes!!
Tables seem to be the answer to a number of restrictions:
Anything can be placed in a table cell (even another table!) so for
Forms they would seem extremely potent!

Paragraph text can now be placed alongside bitmaps, rather than just
the first line of text a longstanding requirement of mine.

If anyone is interested, one of the nice features of EBT's DynaWeb
(the SGML server which does HTML conversion) is the searching. It does
many of the things mentioned, including highlighting (via the <b>
tag), and sub-document addressing.

One design decision I made for DynaWeb was to use (or possibly abuse)
the forms data (ie. the name/value pairs following the ?). This is
where the search expressions and whatnot are stored.

Take a peek at http://www.ebt.com/ and try a few searches like:

  foo and (bar or baz)
  foo within 5 words of bar

On the client side, searching would be quite nice, as would scrolling
to hits. It should be trivial to implement.

I should not that regexp searches are probably a good thing, but only
as part of a fuller search language that allows searching for specific
tags, within specific tags, on attribute values etc.

Is there a well defined language anywhere for searching anywhere? I
saw one called GCL, but I forget the details...

[client- v. server-side issues]

Both client- and server-side searching are needed, so the question of where
best to implement highlighting is moot.  Whatever becomes standard, it
should be able to present the user with the same function regardless of
where the search is being done -- locally, remotely or both at the same
time.  For example, we have customers who want to use CD-ROMs essentially
as local caches for their Web servers (or as a complete, stand-alone
information product for those who don't have net connections).  The CD will
have a browser and our search engine/user interface on it.  The idea is
that the user won't have to know which data is where, the browser and
search engine will be smart enough to search both places and return the
most up-to-date information.

Highlighting should work the same no matter where the data resides, at
least as far as users are concerned... and regardless of the viewer.

  It copies _every_ link you move over to the clipboard?  How rude and

Cello can also do this via the right mouse-button, bringing up a dialog box 
that allows you to view and optionally copy the URL.

The idea of "property inspection" et. al. via the right mouse-button used in 
many MS Windows programs would be very handy in Web browsers, especially if 
it could do a HEAD of the document (maybe via a dialog box checkbox).

I don't know about the POSIX libraries, but Henry Spencer's 
re-implementation of Bell V8 regexp is freely available; all he requires is 
that you document him as the author of the routines, and that any changes 
you make are your responsibility as far as bugs introduced.  I have ported 
these to Microsoft Windows, UNIX, and VMS with extremely minor changes. 
 Perl uses a modified version of these functions.

A local user asked today how he should create a link that would let
web surfers mail him feedback on his home page. He had tried to use
someone else's setup that used a CGI script that was not installed on
our server.

The current way we have been handling forms, have been to let a CGI
script create a mail message, and send it to the appropriate
person. I've always found this a bit unsatisfactory, because it means
that all mail from the form, gets nobody@falch.no as the sender. You
have to rely on the person filling out the form to set the correct
address (perhaps augmented by some code that checks the address
against the domain name of the client).

So I dug up the July 1994 HTML 2.0 RFC draft, and started reading. If
I read page 2-25 correctly, it doesn't put any limits on what type of
URL you can use in the "action" attribute. It didn't say that you
could use a "mailto" URL there, but as far as I can see it doesn't say
you couldn't.

Well, I have 3 browsers at hand that I know have both forms and
support for "mailto" URLs (Lynx 2.3, Tuebingen XMosaic 2.5.something,
and Netscape), so I decided to experiment a little [1] (if I start
getting obscure messages from this, it'll disappear. Please just
look!). 

I found that the only browser of the three that did (IMO) The Right
Thing, was Netscape.

The Right Thing here would be:
 Where the action attribute in a <form> element is a "mailto" URL, and
 the method attribute is "post", create a message on the fly and send
 the contents of the <input>s of the form to the mail address given by
 the URL

And I would very much like to see other browsers copy the Netscape
approach.

I found that the only browser of the three that did (IMO) The Right
Thing, was Netscape.

The Right Thing here would be:
 Where the action attribute in a <form> element is a "mailto" URL, and
 the method attribute is "post", create a message on the fly and send
 the contents of the <input>s of the form to the mail address given by
 the URL

And I would very much like to see other browsers copy the Netscape
approach.

What about running a PC based WWW server and providing the required 
access from CGI scripts running on that server?  See 
http://www.alisa.com/win-httpd/ for info on the Alisa WWW server, which 
is one of several for Windows - it includes a great CGI interface which 
makes it easy to write programs (especially in Visual Basic) which ferret 
around your PC environment/network to return information via HTTP

I had a draft message which basically said the same as Derek's :-)

The hazard of notification storms is real, as is the notification of
temporary problems, but that could be configurable.

Derek raised the question if notification response should be
implemented in the server. The same question goes for the notification
sending. I see a few possibilities:

a) Built notification sending into the server. This means everyone
   gets it automatically with their server, but it may be a bit tricky
   to maintain state (when you last sent what notification to who).

b) Run a sending script over the logs. Means we could experiment/
   implement it RSN, puts a human in control, let's us add a 
   'use-this-link-instead' database, and means you're not
   likely to get storms as you can easily maintain state.

c) Receive notifications as an HTTP method in the server. Means
   everyone gets it automatically, but it may not be too configurable,
   and requires an HTTP change.

d) Standardise a URL to post a standard form to (/cgi-bin/broken).
   This can then be handled by a CGI script. Means we could
   experiment/implement now, but requires some effort to set up
   (unless servers install it by default).

e) Don't standardise the receiving at all, but use heuristics like
   Michael Chang's scripts. Means we don't have to standardise
   anything, but continue with responding to email.

While I favour the flexible ways (b & d), I think it's going to be
even more dificult to standardise operational behaviour than protocol
(and we now how much fun that is :).

Of course, this HTTP solution doesn't work for non-http protocols,
which can also have broken links.

Hmmm... I agree with Dan and others that we should see if we can steal
ideas from other systems/mechanisms first, but I'm not sure that we can,
or even want to, drastically change the way the web works now.

A similar argument could be made for including "group annotations" on the
server side, while merging in "personal annotations" on the client side.  The
key is that the original document can be augmented or enhanced as it is
retrieved.(While experimenting with cascading caches using an NCSA httpd, we
found it quite useful to include "no-cache" links along with the age of the
document in the cache as a quick means of seeing where a document ripened the
longest.)

Enhancing the granularity/functionality of fragment id's will be a useful
addition for search interfaces in general, regardless of where the
functionality is actually implemented. Since bandwidth is free and 
compute cycles are cheap, the processing could migrate to the server or
to the client depending on the load on either end of the request.

A properly functioning cache should not be serving a document whose
original has been updated. In practice, depending on the guesswork
and arcane magic used to conjure up expiry dates, I suppose current caches
will serve them, so Martijn's concern is well placed.

BTW wasn't the point of LINK REV=made href="mailto:blah@site" so that
clients could notify the maker of a document if it had broken links?

I thought some browsers already did this - Lynx springs to mind.

If you read the January edition of WiReD you will find that its all in
black and white. It seems like they blew the whole of the budget for fancy
printing in the first few issues :-(

They do have `Get Wired' in Braille on the front cover though - useful for
all their blind readers...

In the library world (at least in Scandinavia), these two enjoy some
popularity:

ISO 8777, "Common Command Language" (CCL) defines a set of commands for
searching interactive information systems. Specifically, it defines
a boolean query-format with truncation, proximity, etc.

ANSI Z39.50 (and ISO 10163) define, as part of a protocol for information
retrieval, an abstract structure for expressing queries.

   Emacs-w3, AIR Mosaic, and I believe OmniWeb do this as well.

I am trying to convince Netscape to use MS-Excel as helper application.
The idea behind this is that a user can select a MS-Excel spreadsheet
from a html page by clicking an icon.

The html page contains:

        <A HREF="spreadsheet.xls"><IMG SRC="/lib/xlicon.gif"></A>

In Netscape, the helper settings in Options->Preferences are set to
to start Excel when an *.xls file is received:
   - Mime type: application
   - subtype: excel
   - extension: xls
   - action: launch application (application specified as
     excel.exe in the right directory)

What happens is that if the user clicks on the icon the file spreadsheet.xls
is loaded, but Netscape does not start Excel, but shows the spreadsheet
as a lot of garbage text.

Obviously, I am doing something wrong. Any suggestions ?

Thanks in advance!

Hi all,

I am sure the HTML 2.0 does not give the option of making
a scorlled list scrollable horizontally. i.e we could specify
<SELECT NAME="who-to-do-it-with" ROWS=8 COLS=20>.
Does HTML 3.0 provide a similar capability? It would be a
good UI feature, that too when you would like to provide the
user the exact info (text) he is looking for and less
headache to the server in terms of pattern matching etc,
any comments?

cheers

Have you configured application/excel on the server side as a mime type?
We use this constantly and it works fine.

What you cannot do with Netscape is have a shell script, 
"cgi-bin/spreadsheet.xls" look for "application/excel" in the
"Accept" headers since Netscape won't send the headers.  If
your .xls file is a true spreadsheet or tab-delimited file, you
should have no problem.

also proposes a new "multipart/form-data" for sending back form data
without URL-encoding it. "multipart/form-data" could be used as an
ENCTYPE even without any file capability as a way to send form results
to humans that is more intelligible.

You've got the client set up ok, but I bet your server is attaching a MIME
type of text/plain to the document when it transfers it.  Try adding
application/x-excel with the file extension .xls to the list of
filename->MIME type mappings that your server uses.  The server docs tell
you how to do this (with the NCSA httpd, you can edit a file called
mime.types in the conf directory)

Good point.  When you get down to it, highlights could be considered to be
a search engine's annotations!  A general annotation scheme might thus be
useful for many purposes.  Interesting ideas would be gizmos that would
link document sections to FAQs, as sort of an automated "explain this"
annotater... Our Topics are rather nifty for that sort of thing, if I might
plug ever so slightly.

I smell creeping elegance, however.  It may be here, or perhaps is still
around the bend.

How about a variant of the way you used to handle updates for the
Movie Database? (don't know if you do it this way anymore. Been a
while since I contributed...:-).

The form containing the fields call a CGI script. This CGI script
creates a HTML document containng a form. The <form> consists of a
textarea containing the formatted text and a "submit" input, with a
"mailto" to whatever human is supposed to receive the data as the
<form>'s "action".

Pretty much as it used to be, but instead of coming from
whateveridthehttpisrunningon@www.cm.cf.ac.uk the formatted mail is
sent from whatever the mail address of the browser is set to
(hopefully the address of the contributor, but in any case an
improvement over whateveridthehttpisrunningon).

The movie database now uses vanilla mailto: to submit data.
(NCSA Mosaic users have lots of fun with this...)
The new data is formatted for the user and displayed with a
mailto: address.

Netscape users click on the link, add a subject line (shame this can't
be automated via the mailto URL), then click on the "include" button
to copy the text into the mail editor. The mail server at the other end
strips off the ugly "> " line prefix (which should be configurable) before 
processing it.

I'd probably switch to a mailto: form, if only Netscape behaved and
sent plain text instead of URL encoded mail.

Why not URL decode on the mail server ? - it's not my mailserver. I
can't keep asking for it to be changed to accept different types of
mangled data.

Netscape form mailto: exists but is so "broken" that it is useless.
It doesn't conform to the HTML spec that I've read. "enctype" and
<MH HIDDEN> get ingored.

I have my fingers crossed for 1.1

Ncom, how about a list of the features that will be fixed in 1.1 ?,
so that the impatient among us can see that we aren't being ignored...
your automated bug report acknowledgement mail gets tedious after a while.

Agreed, I've had trouble with these kinds of lists.. One big entry
in the list sends the list scroll bar a few feet off to your right. You
scroll the browser right so that you can see the list scroll bar, but now
you can't see the rest of the items in the list and you have to scroll back
again... Maybe we should also have a choice of left/right positioning
of the list scrollbar.

Also, most browsers don't scroll down to the default item(s), which
can be out of sight... Not seeing default settings can be dangerous -
espcially if there's a multiple choice and you can't see the default
to switch it off.

Ah... this touches a nerve. There are a _lot_ of applications of
this sort in action today:

	* hypermail takes RFC822 messages and adds links, and reformats
	them.

	Problem: what if I want the original RFC822 message? (why? because
	it's digitally signed, or for other reasons of authenticity) I can't
	get it through most hypermail archives today.

	* Folks take a plain-text FAQ, or an interesting article, or whatever,
	and they "htmlize" it. Sometimes they put a link to their home page,
	or to the server's home page or whatever.

The point is: I would like to have some "audit trail" for such annotations.
I would like to be able to check the HTML version against the original, maybe,
or recover the original for any number of purposes.

It seems to me that the Right Thing To Do in they hypermail case, is for
the server to send the orignal RFC822 message, plus some annotations,
and then have the browser compose them -- or not!

But this is not optimal: you have zillions of browsers repeating the
work.  Plus, the "composition" might be really involved and different
applications will want to do it differently, and it may require access
to a big database that only the server can see and...

One solution is to give the client the option of retracing the audit
trail with something like:

	<head>
	<link rel="original" href="original-msg.txt">
	</head>

	<body>
	message with annotations...
	</body>

More later... gotta go.

But the purpose of Hypermail and similar software (which I've written --
see <URL:http://asearch.mccmedia.com/>) is for third parties to archive
e-mail lists.  They *shouldn't* preserve the digital signature if they mess
with the document, since a signature should only apply to the original
document as the writer created it.

Same answer.

Ah, well, I've implemented something that almost does this.  Because my
Hypermail-like software sometimes messes up formatting and such, I include
in each message a link to the original, untouched message.  Actually, in
the current implementation, the body is untouched -- I still mess with the
headers, since they're unambiguous, or should be.  But obviously, a link to
the original, as part of the annotation process, is essential in some
applications.

I think you're basically proposing that the link to the original be
standardized so that it can become a browser feature, which may have some
merit in a full-on annotation scheme.

Not to diminish Dan's point too much, but hypermail works off of RFC
822 email archives, not individual text messages, so there is no
"original-msg.txt" to refer to.

>	<head>
>	<link rel="original" href="original-msg.txt">

Many other documents may also be derived (e.g. from data bases, server
side includes) and have no "original" to refer to.

[Look out folks. This could be a long one. We finally finished and

lot about Terry's proposal and how the Harvest Technology applies, and
how we increase quality on the web in general in preparation for my
"Formalizing Web Technology" presentation for next week's WebWorld
conference.

I copied all these lists becaue I think there may be interested folks
on all these lists. I suggest follow-ups be sent only to

Yes, it's fragile, but it's better than completely broken.

This is _distributed_ hypertext. It spans domains of authority. As an
author, I have authority over the info I put in the link, but I may
not have the authority to change the filename on the server.  So I'm
stuck.

This situation will only get more complex: as a value-added proxy
server, I can add annotations, show references to related documents,
etc., but I can't change the original.

I think this is directly relavent to your URN/davenport application[1].

>From the evidence that I have studied, the way to make links more
reliable is not to deploy some new centralized namespace (ala URNs
with publisher id's), but to put more redundant info in links.

Rather than looking at the web as documents addressed by an
identifier, I think we should look at it as a great big
content-addressable-memory.  "Give me the document written by Fred in
1992 whose title is 'authentication in distributed systems'."

I think the same sort of thing that makes for a high-quality citation
in written materials will make for a reliable link in a distributed
hypermedia system. A robust _link_ should look like a BibTex entry
(MARC record, etc.)

Given a system like harvest[2], it makes sense to handle queries like
"find me the document who's publisher is O'Reilly and Associates,
published in 1994 under the title 'DNS and Bind'." Their model for
distributed indexing, brokers, replication, and caching (with
taxonomies and query routing in the works) has me convinced that it's
the right way to go.

One party actually develops the document (or program or
database...). Another publishes it. Some folks referee it. Another
party advertises/markets it. Another party provides shared disk space
and bandwith for a fee. Another party is an expert librarian for some
field. All of these parties are humans or groups of humans, but they
are all aided more or less by the machines that participate in this
distributed hypermedia system.

All these folks share resources. Each of them has different policies
and procedures, different experties, different goals. The way to make
the whole thing work is
	(1) let the computer do the work, wherever we can, and
	(2) keep the simple thinks simple
	(3) make the complex things possible.

So if I as the link author know more than the reader's client can get
from the FTP server, I should be _able_ to contribute the knowledge
that I have. Making all the authors put content type info in their
links is the the wrong answer; the optimal solution is for the
provider to adapt to the .ps convention. But the link author should
be able to add value and quality despite the poor efforts of the
FTP server maintainer.

"But the link author could just copy that file and put a .ps extension
on his own machine," you might reply. This doesn't allow for the case
when the document in question changes daily, and it doesn't provide an
audit trail, and it violates my #1 engineering principal: never
maintain the same information in more than one place.


The whole point is that as long as links just give one little point of
information, they're going to be fragile. In effect, URLs give several
pieces of information. They usually give a DNS domain name, so you can
deploy conventions like having webmaster@host be the point of contact
for a given server. From a typical "home page" address

	http://host/~user.html

I can infer that user@host is the associated mailbox. It's not 100%,
but it usually works.

That brings me to another point: The sharing of information can only
be automated to the point that it can be formalized. I've been trying
to find some formalism for the way the web works. I've decided that
this is a useful excercise for areas like security, where you have to
be 100% sure of your conclusions relative to your premises.

But for the web in general, 100% accuracy and authenticity is not
necessary. The web is a model for human knowledge, and human knowledge
is generally not clean and pricise -- it's not even 100% consistent.
So I think that in stead of modelling the web with formal systems like
Larch[3], a more "fuzzy" AI knowledge-representation sort of approach
like Algernon[4] is the way to go. Traditional formal systems like
Larch rely on consistency, which is not a good model for the knowledge
base deployed on the web.


The URN model of publisher ID/local-identifier may be sufficient for
the applications of moving the traditional publishing model onto the
web. But that is only one application of the technology that it takes
to achieve high quality links. Another application may have some other
idea of what the "critical meta-information" is. For example, for bulk
file distribution (ala archie/ftp), the MD5 is critical.


OK... so... now that I've a brian dump, how about a specific answer
to the "Davenport proposal":


Problem Statement
=================

The Davenport Group is a group of experts in technical documentation,
mostly representing Unix system vendors.  They have developed DocBook,
a shared SGML-based representation for technical documentation. They
will probably be using a combination of CD-ROM distribution and the
Internet to deliver their techincal documention.

They are developing hypertext documentation; they each have solutions
for CD-ROM distribution, but while the World-Wide Web is the most
widely-deployed technology for internet distribution, it does not meet
their needs for response time nor reliability of links over time. As
publishers, they are willing to invest resources to increase the
quality of service for the information they provide over the web.

Moreover, the solution for increased reliability must be shared among
the vendors and publishers, as the links will cross company
boundaries. Ideally, the solution will be part of an Internet-wide
strategy to increase the quality of service in information retrieval.


Theory of Operation
===================

The body of information offered by these vendors can be regarded as a
sort of distributed relational database, the rows being individual
documents (retrievable entities, to be precise), and the columns being
attributes of those documents, such as content, publisher, author,
title, date of publication, etc.

The pattern of access on this database is much like many databases:
some columns are searched, and then the relavent row is selected. This
motivates keeping a certain portion of this data, sometimes referred
to as "meta-data," or indexing information, highly available.

The harvest system is a natural match. Each vendor or publisher would
operate a gatherer, which culls the indexing information from the rows
of the database that it maintains. A harvest broker would collect the
indexing information into an aggregate index. This gatherer/broker
collection interaction is very efficient, and the load on a
publisher's server would be minimal. The broker can be replicated to
provide sufficiently high availability.

Typically, a harvest broker exports a forms-based HTTP searching
interface. But locating documents in the davenport database is a
non-interactive process in this system. Ultimately, smart browsers
can be deployed to conduct the search of the nearest broker and
select the appropriate document automatically. But the system should
interoperate with existing web clients.

Hence the typical HTTP/harvest proxy will have to be modified to not
only search the index, but also select the appropriate document and
retrieve it. To decrease latency, a harvest cache should be collocated
with each such proxy.

Ideally, links would be represented in the harvest query syntax, or a
simple s-expression syntax. (Wow! In surfing around for references, I
just found an example of how these links could be implemented. See the
PRDM project[2].) But since the only information passed from
contemporary browsers to proxy servers is a URL, the query syntax will
have to be embedded in the URL syntax.

I'll leave the details aside for now, but for example, the query:

	(Publisher-ISBN: 1232) AND (Title: "Mircosoft Windows User Guide")
		AND (Edition: Second)

might be encoded as:

	harvest:/davenport?publisher-isbn=1232;title=Microsoft%20Windows%20Users%20Guide;edition=Second

Each client browser is configured with the host and port of the
nearest davenport broker/HTTP proxy. The reason for the "//davenport"
in the above URL is that such a proxy could serve other application
indices as well. Ultimately, browsers might implement the harvest:
semantics natively, and the browser could use the Harvest Server
Registry to resolve the "davenport" keyword to the address of a
suitable broker.

To resolve the above link, the browser client contacts the proxy and
sends the full URL. The proxy contacts a nearby davenport broker,
which processes the query and returns results. The broker then selects
any match from those results.

Through careful administration of the links and the index, all the
matches should identify replicas of the same entity, possibly on
different ftp/http/gopher servers. An alternative to manually
replicating the data on these various servers would be to let the
harvest cache collocated with the broker provide high availability of
the document content.


Security Considerations
=======================

The main considerations are authenticity and access control for the
distributed database.

Securely-obtained links (from a CD-ROM, for example) could include the
MD5 checksum of the target document. If the target document changes, a
digital signature providing a secure override to the MD5 could be
transmitted in the HTTP header. Assuming the publishers' public keys
are made available to the cache/proxies in a secure fashion, this
would allow the cache/proxy to detect a forgery. But the link from the
cache/proxy to the client is insecure until clients are enhanced to
implement more of this functionality natively. At that point, the
problem of key distribution becomes more complex.

This proposal does not address access control. As long as all
information distributed over the web is public, this solution is
complete. But over time, the publishers will expect to be able
to control access to their information.

If the publishers were willing to trust the cache/proxy servers to
implement access control, I expect an access control mechanism could
be added to this system. If the publishers are willing to allow the
indexing information to remain public, I believe that performance
would not suffer tremendously. The primary difficulty would be
distributing a copy of the access control database among the proxies
in a secure fashion.


Conclusions
===========

I believe this solution scales well in many ways. It allows the
publishers to be responsible for the quality of the index and the
links, while delegating the responsibility of high-availability to
broker and cache/proxy servers. The publishers could reach agreements
with network providers to distribute those brokers among the client
population (much like the GNN is available through various sites.)

It allows those cache/proxy servers to provide high-availability to
other applications as well as the davenport community. (The Linux
community and the Computer Science Technical reports community already
operate harvest brokers.)

The impact on clients is minimal -- a one-time configuration of the
address of the nearest proxy. I believe that the benefits to the
respective parties outweigh the cost of deployment, and that this
solution is very feasible.

The server machine that hosts Global Network Navigator 
(gnn.com, aka nearnet.gnn.com) has been having some very 
mysterious problems in the past couple of weeks, and so 
far any solutions have evaded us.

We've got a 2-processor Sun Sparc20, with 128mb of 
memory, running Solaris 2.3.  The HTTP server is stock
NCSA httpd 1.3.  The machine is located at the NEARnet
office in Cambridge, on their Ethernet, with access
to their T3 network connection(s?).

Most of the time, the server works well.  But occasionally, 
connections made to the HTTP server will hang, with 
xmosaic saying 'Making HTTP connection...' and eventually 
timing out.  If I cancel the connection (click the 
spinning earth) and try again, sometimes the connection 
will succeed, but more often it will hang again.  If I 
retry 10-20 seconds later, the connection will usually 
succeed.  Oddly, either I get a connection quickly, or
it never comes through.

So it seems to be some kind of cycle -- the server hangs, 
it eventually times out, connections work, and then 
eventually it hangs again.  My guess is that the main
httpd server -- the one that forks off for each request --
is hanging or sleeping for some reason, and not waking
up to take incoming requests.  It times out, eventually,
and traffic starts flowing again.

It may have something to do with the amount of traffic --
yesterday's HTTP access log contained 279,471 requests
(avg. 3/second).  Ironically, it was the most popular
day in GNN ever!

The machine doesn't appear to be heavily loaded; the 
load average rarely gets to 1.0.  Memory usage seems to
be ok (although getting tight, with only 10-20mb 
free RAM).

Since we've been getting complaints from users all 
over the net, we feel this is not a problem related 
to the network connection between the O'Reilly offices 
and NEARnet.  Also, pinging the host seems to work
regardless of the state of the HTTP server, which 
seems to signal some problem in httpd, not in the 
network connection or kernel.

In general, the machine has been running quite well 
for the last 6 months, except for recently, when we 
lost a disk on our RAID array.  The relationship between
the current problems and the bad disk may just be 
coincidental, since we *think* we've gotten the disk
system back to normal, and since this seems to only
affect httpd.

Has anyone else noticed problems with NCSA httpd 
under these kind of conditions?  Any thoughts?
Suggestions?  Magic invocations? ;)

As does the formerly mentioned Netscape running on Win31. Just moves the

These problems are suspiciously similar to problems we've been having
with home.mcom.com in recent weeks. Each time a failure similar to the
one you describe happens, we've been able to isolate a backbone or
trunk line somewhere which has gone down and is causing some amount of
the Internet to get suddenly cut off from our server for indefinite
amounts of time. When these failures happen, we now use traceroute
with a set of common hosts to locate the line which is down.

Our analysis of this problem which is confirmed by gathered evidence
and correspondence with SGI (we run IRIX web servers) is that the
incoming connection queue is being filled. Normally, TCP kernels
maintain a queue of connections which are in the process of being
negotiated. An entry in this queue is used when a browser initiates a
connection to the server machine, and is occupied until the connection
is fully negotiated and has been accepted by the server software.

When a trunk line goes down, many of these queue slots can be occupied
by connections which are in the process of negotiation. Because the
line between the server and that machine has been severed, those queue
slots will be occupied either until the line comes back up, or two
minutes elapses.

If the server is accepting between 20 and 30 new connections per
second as home.mcom.com often does, it does not take long to fill this
queue. We had our queue size set to 128, which was sufficient for most
of December, but recent failures along with our increased traffic have
been enough to exhaust even this size.

To change your queue size, you need to change the kernel's maximum
connection request size. Under BSD, this parameter is called
SOMAXCONN. Since you're using Solaris, you can use the ndd command to
set your maximum queue size higher. The parameter you want to
experiment with is tcp_conn_req_max.

Finally, you have to change your server software to use a larger queue
size. The NCSA httpd, if I remember correctly, uses a queue size of
5. Search for a call to listen() and experiment with the value.

If anyone else has more data on this problem, we'd love to hear about
it. I hope this helps anyone who is having similar problems with their
servers. I heard a rumor that these problems are being caused somehow
by routing, Sprint and MCI. Anybody know more?

I don't get it. It seems straighforward to extract a single message
out of an "RFC 822 email archive" and serve it up.

Or heck, give me a pointer to the whole archive. That's fine by me.
That at least makes it _possible_ for me to get my job done.

OK. If the source data in such a situation is completely unobservable
from the net, then I'd consider whatever byproduct is made available to
be the original. No audit trail necessary there.

I found the same thing with an NCSA httpd 1.3 server that we were using to
distribute an e-journal on campus.  The articles in the journal had lots
of maths and these were handled with inlined images.  A single article
could thus have anywhere upto a couple of hundred inlined images in it.

Most of the time the server worked fine, but if it was used in a classroom
setting with 20 or 30 clients all hitting the server at once, we'd see the
same problem as you.  There are several things you can try in order to fix it:

1) Run the server standalone rather than from inetd.  This means that the
server won't have to reread its config file.

2) Turn off identd logging if you don't need it.  This uses another TCP
connection which can be a limited resource on a busy WWW host.

3) Look in the httpd source and find any calls to listen().  These usually
specify a queue length of 5 TCP connections to listen for.  I upped it to
20.

Anyway, I did 1) and 3) and it seemed to fix our problem.

Dear All

Up until now I use a bare ASCII editor to create HTML - I havent
yet found an editor that produces the code as I like it, and I'm
afraid I see an aesthetic appeal in well presented code.
OK I Confess: I wear my little W3 socks in bed (well I am British!)

HOWEVER:
Tables are Oh So useful, and Oh So painful to code; so far I've done
my CV (no surprises that was the first thing I tried!) and that took
an age!!

SO :
I'll give up my aesthetic pretentions for an editor/macro that can
hack tables, if anyone knows of one. Ideally a macro for Excel would
seem to be the answer, but I'm not a basic programmer and would still
like to keep some kind of life:-)

Any suggestions.

PS Anyone know when Netscape will support Tables, a major omision
IMHO.

We're having the same problem on sunsite with NCSA 2.3 and Solaris 2.4.

Seems like all the big servers are encountering it... sigh. We're in 
touch with the Solaris TCP development team and they're working on it.

Unfortunately tcp_conn_req_max has a maximum value of 32 under solaris... 
I'll tell you more as I learn it (and forward this to the engineers at sun)

As I mentioned before many things very similar to these ideas (putting
a search term into a URL to designate a location for the browser to
start) have been implemented on the server side in the WN server
You see a list of the types possible at 
	<http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/search.html>

But an interesting thing occurred to me about the nature of WWW while
thinking about the relative merits of client side versus server side
implementations for this kind of functionality.  If it is done on the
server (as it is in WN) then for that server it just works -- with every
client.  On the other hand to do it in the client requires the daunting
political task of arriving at a consensual standard and getting it 
implemented in all the browsers.  This is a case where I opt for the
server side for purely social and political reasons, even though
technically there are some advantages to the client side.

The listen() system call in SunOS4.1.3 and IRIX4.0.5F silently maxes
the queue length parameter sent by the caller to 5, i.e. the system
neither generates an error nor increases its internal accept() queue
length to more than 5, if you specify anything higher than 5.  So
I'm curious how upping the listen() parameter to 20 could help,
unless you hack the kernel and recompile it with larger queue buffers
to handle 20 simultaneous connection requests to the same socket,
like someone mentioned earlier (sorry I don't keep logs and can't 
recall your name).

Still, even if the system really supports 20 allowable queue size, and 
supposing 22 simultaneous connection-request packets come in together,
then since processing a connection by httpd is likely to take much 
longer than registering the connection-request on the queue, the
22nd connection-request is likely to run into an out-of-queue-buffer
situation and gets dropped.  (the first conn-request gets serviced,
then the next 20 conn-requests get stuffed onto the queue, and the
22nd conn-request gets dropped).  Meanwhile, the browser which sent
the 22nd conn-request packet waits forever thinking that the packet
is winding through an exceptionally long path.

So, increasing the kernel's queue buffer to a sufficiently large size
is probably one way to tackle the problem.  But say if the size is
upped to 20, and a teacher instructs a class of 30+ students to
"click on this server now", I suspect about 7 or 8 students will
still watch the earth spinning when others have got their files.

The above is assuming the conn-request packets don't go through
routers, which are additional sources from which packets could be
dropped.

I suspect coming versions of browsers might want to take into account
potentially heavily loaded servers (but otherwise still reachable
network-wise) which may constantly have queues close to its
maximum queue size, and should preempt its own connection request
and attempt to retry the connection again (repeat for, say, 3 times
before giving up).  

Just my 2 cents.

I have been working on a similar idea for a client of mine.

We are interested in having a feature that allows a user to move
interchangeably between the WWW and the local disk(s).  This is trivial for
HTML files or documents, but for running scripts (search engines, imagemap)
or parsing forms, there is not current method.  One option which to me seems
non-ideal is to run a server in a loopback kind of mode on the local machine.

My idea as to how this might be implemented would be a new type of URL:
exec://your.machine.here/scriptname        --- for remote scripts
exec://scriptname                          --- for local scripts

This would essentially (but wouldn't have to) do away with the cgi-bin
directory and allow users to place scripts where they liked. 

Unforunately this seems to break with convention that a URL type represents
a unique and singular transfer protocol.  This implementation would require
"exec" to use http when functioning remotely.  Obviously for local scripts,
some shell like functionality would have to be built in to the browsers.

The clear advantage of this is the ability to take entire hierarchies of WWW
server data, cgi-scripts, databases and/or search engines and burn them onto
CD-ROMs (for example) and then access them locally.  While the limited
bandwidth of todays networks makes that a useful application now, future
applications might include self contained kiosk units, etc.

I envision mainly two counter arguements.
1) As the bandwidth increases, as it will, there will be no need for
distributing data on fixed media, but instead, everyone will just get what
they want over the network.
RESPONSE: That bandwidth availability is not currently in place, and
probably is far enough away that valuable use will result from this
alternative.  Furthermore, there may always be situations where people want
to take data "on the road" with them, perhaps even to places where the
network has not yet reached.

2) Why not write proprietary viewing software for your database or hierarchy
which allows you to run local scripts?
RESPONSE: Building into a URL allow the browser to seemlessly go from the
local machine to the network and back without quitting one application and
starting another.  It also allows the same authoring conventions to be used
when constructing the local information so that portability and use by
others is straightforward.

While I understand many of Roy's objections I do not agree that many of them
need to be a problem.

I favour an approach of a server informing the referring server if a link
doesn't work. What the referring server does with the information should be
configurable (e.g. send email to the webmaster or other individual depending
on the location of the refering page, log to a file, ignore completely or even
automatically correct the error). This should not present an issue to
webmasters about receiving hundreds of failure messages.

If my server receives a failure message it can check if there really is a
broken link and then, depending on who owns the offending page, it can inform
them. My server could also have thresholds for when it informs people of
broken links and how often.

The server which receives the duff request could be similarly configured to
only send a single message to each referrer which requests non-existant data
or even to wait until it had received a given number of requests from the same
referrer before sending it a failure message.

I am not sure whether this functionality should be in the server or a separate
server and client. The advantage of having it in the server is that that way
everyone gets it automatically :-)

I realise that this approach is only a partial solution to the problem, but I
do not see any total solutions on the horizon so I think a partial one is
better than none.

My understanding of TCP is that it will retry even connection requests 
for 30 seconds or so. Dropping of one packet shouldn't make you "wait 
forever". Of course, repeatedly dropping packets should cause the 
connection to time out, but Lynx doesn't seem to detect this, from what I 
can see.    --Darren

   We're having the same problem on sunsite with NCSA 2.3 and Solaris 2.4.

Here's another confirmation --- we've been seeing this on and off at
the MIT AI lab for a while now.  It seemed to get worse for some
reason when we switched to a new (dedicated) machine as Web server
this week; this may be coincidental, however.  (I don't know if we're
one of "the big sites", but we do get a lot of traffic --- our peak so
far has been very nearly 100K hits/day, or somewhat more than a third
of GNN).

A question --- has anyone observed this syndrome with software other
than NCSA httpd, or with a machine other than a Sun?

There is one thing wrong with this proposal: it assumes that the
entire document can be sent to the client, and this will become less
true over time... there will always be a need to do searching on the
server side.

Personally, I think the whole # and ? thing needs to be rethought.
With any kind of complex query, the URL's get very very ugly, and very
long. Something more like the old TEXTSEARCH method, done on the
server side might be a whole lot better. The server could send back
hit occurence data in the headers returned with the retreived text,
and the client could use such data for highlighting, and also
scrolling purposes.

I'm currently using this in a script I wrote, assuming it was the
intended behavior for Referer.  The script does some manipulation on
part of Web space, and a URL must be supplied to indicate which part.
The Referer value is the most reasonable default value I could think of;
used for this purpose, it would be quite useful to fill it even on 'Open URL'
actions, hotlist selections, or any other means of jumping to URLs.

I haven't studied the rationale for Referer in any detail, but the 'buggy'
ibehavior is useful in any case.

Even if you can't/won't mess with the local MTA, you can still use
something like procmail [1] to process your mail, here are a few lines
from my ~/.procmailrc file:

<html>

}

</html>

decode-url.pl is a tiny perl script (included at the end of this
message) which reads the old message body on stdin, and writes a new
message body on stdout. It needs a little polishing (heck! a *lot* of
polishing), but the basics are there.

   ...From the evidence that I have studied, the way to make links more
   reliable is not to deploy some new centralized namespace (ala URNs
   with publisher id's), but to put more redundant info in links.

   Rather than looking at the web as documents addressed by an
   identifier, I think we should look at it as a great big
   content-addressable-memory.  "Give me the document written by Fred in
   1992 whose title is 'authentication in distributed systems'."

   I think the same sort of thing that makes for a high-quality citation
   in written materials will make for a reliable link in a distributed
   hypermedia system. A robust _link_ should look like a BibTex entry
   (MARC record, etc.)


   strategy to increase the quality of service in information retrieval.


   Theory of Operation
   ===================

   The body of information offered by these vendors can be regarded as a
   sort of distributed relational database, the rows being individual
   documents (retrievable entities, to be precise), and the columns being
   attributes of those documents, such as content, publisher, author,
   title, date of publication, etc.

   The pattern of access on this database is much like many databases:
   some columns are searched, and then the relavent row is selected. This
   motivates keeping a certain portion of this data, sometimes referred
   to as "meta-data," or indexing information, highly available.

   The harvest system is a natural match. Each vendor or publisher would
   operate a gatherer, which culls the indexing information from the rows
   of the database that it maintains. A harvest broker would collect the
   indexing information into an aggregate index. This gatherer/broker
   collection interaction is very efficient, and the load on a
   publisher's server would be minimal. The broker can be replicated to
   provide sufficiently high availability.

   Typically, a harvest broker exports a forms-based HTTP searching
   interface. But locating documents in the davenport database is a
   non-interactive process in this system. Ultimately, smart browsers
   can be deployed to conduct the search of the nearest broker and
   select the appropriate document automatically. But the system should
   interoperate with existing web clients.

   Hence the typical HTTP/harvest proxy will have to be modified to not
   only search the index, but also select the appropriate document and
   retrieve it. To decrease latency, a harvest cache should be collocated
   with each such proxy.

   Ideally, links would be represented in the harvest query syntax, or a
   simple s-expression syntax. (Wow! In surfing around for references, I
   just found an example of how these links could be implemented. See the
   PRDM project[2].) But since the only information passed from
   contemporary browsers to proxy servers is a URL, the query syntax will
   have to be embedded in the URL syntax.

   I'll leave the details aside for now, but for example, the query:

	   (Publisher-ISBN: 1232) AND (Title: "Mircosoft Windows User Guide")
		   AND (Edition: Second)

   might be encoded as:

	   harvest:/davenport?publisher-isbn=1232;title=Microsoft%20Windows%20Users%20Guide;edition=Second

   Each client browser is configured with the host and port of the
   nearest davenport broker/HTTP proxy. The reason for the "//davenport"
   in the above URL is that such a proxy could serve other application
   indices as well. Ultimately, browsers might implement the harvest:
   semantics natively, and the browser could use the Harvest Server
   Registry to resolve the "davenport" keyword to the address of a
   suitable broker.

   To resolve the above link, the browser client contacts the proxy and
   sends the full URL. The proxy contacts a nearby davenport broker,
   which processes the query and returns results. The broker then selects
   any match from those results.

   Through careful administration of the links and the index, all the
   matches should identify replicas of the same entity, possibly on
   different ftp/http/gopher servers. An alternative to manually
   replicating the data on these various servers would be to let the
   harvest cache collocated with the broker provide high availability of
   the document content.


   Security Considerations
   =======================

   The main considerations are authenticity and access control for the
   distributed database.

   Securely-obtained links (from a CD-ROM, for example) could include the
   MD5 checksum of the target document. If the target document changes, a
   digital signature providing a secure override to the MD5 could be
   transmitted in the HTTP header. Assuming the publishers' public keys
   are made available to the cache/proxies in a secure fashion, this
   would allow the cache/proxy to detect a forgery. But the link from the
   cache/proxy to the client is insecure until clients are enhanced to
   implement more of this functionality natively. At that point, the
   problem of key distribution becomes more complex.

   This proposal does not address access control. As long as all
   information distributed over the web is public, this solution is
   complete. But over time, the publishers will expect to be able
   to control access to their information.

   If the publishers were willing to trust the cache/proxy servers to
   implement access control, I expect an access control mechanism could
   be added to this system. If the publishers are willing to allow the
   indexing information to remain public, I believe that performance
   would not suffer tremendously. The primary difficulty would be
   distributing a copy of the access control database among the proxies
   in a secure fashion.


   Conclusions
   ===========

   I believe this solution scales well in many ways. It allows the
   publishers to be responsible for the quality of the index and the
   links, while delegating the responsibility of high-availability to
   broker and cache/proxy servers. The publishers could reach agreements
   with network providers to distribute those brokers among the client
   population (much like the GNN is available through various sites.)

   It allows those cache/proxy servers to provide high-availability to
   other applications as well as the davenport community. (The Linux
   community and the Computer Science Technical reports community already
   operate harvest brokers.)

   The impact on clients is minimal -- a one-time configuration of the
   address of the nearest proxy. I believe that the benefits to the
   respective parties outweigh the cost of deployment, and that this
   solution is very feasible.

I may be completely out there so don't yell at me if I don't know 
what the heck I'm talking about, but...

How about upgrading httpd so that it has a range of ports that are
virtually dedicated to it.  Like 10 or something so that from the
default port to ten greater are potentially reserved by httpd.  When
a request comes in, httpd checks it's queue and if there's more than
five requests it re-establishes a connection on the next higher port #
and so on up to processing 55 conections at once (original 5 + 5*10 ports)
.  Every time a connection is made with the server, the first packet back 
will tell the client which port to talk to it on so that the queue can
change dynamically between requests. This would virtually elminate
dropped requests and would then be limited only by the number of ports
assigned and the capabilities of your hardware.  This sort of system
could potentially handle the 10 hits/sec that Netscape/GNN/ et al have
been experiencing.  It's more of a long-term solution to an immediate
problem, but it might be more flexible than building in specialized time
out mechanisms or something along those lines in the browser.

Search engines will still run on the server side, but they
will be able to give the client a list of URLs with the extra
search info attached. If the server is asked for only part of
a document the extra search info in the URL may still be of use, but
if it isn't - it doesn't matter.

Yes, this is possible. The original proposal however would also allow 
anyone to specify a cleint side search keyword, which would mean
that I could jump to and highlight any part of your document that
I wanted, without you providing a search engine or adding an anchor
specifically for my needs.

    There is one thing wrong with this proposal: it assumes that the
    entire document can be sent to the client, and this will become less
    true over time... there will always be a need to do searching on the
    server side.

    Personally, I think the whole # and ? thing needs to be rethought.

I would like to second this motion.  We have syntax for specifying points and
regions for a couple of format that could be used to bound search.  There is
also the issue of various searching schemes that one might want to accomodate.
The schemes should be extensible. (e.g., Z39.50's query type).

After you an a interesting amount of flexibility and power, the URL syntax
will get pretty cumbersome, and something analogous to forms will be
desirable.

Some  of the previous postings refered to Hypermail and RFC 822
what exactly is Hypermail and what is RFC 822 on. 

This leads to the next question - Is there a mechanism to use html as
a mail reader format ?

Yes. We run an SGI machine with Netsite (which is not based off the
NCSA code). I don't know about NCSA httpd, but in the case of Netsite
there are processes ready to accept connections which the kernel is
not giving to them. This led us to suspect kernel-level problems.

But I think you are missing the point, this is meant to be
an addition to any other searching meachanisms out there, not
a replacement. It's an optional browser feature which will work
independently of, or in conjunction with any other search engines
which work from the server-side.

Greetings,

Does this explain the problems AT&T reported with their caching proxy server
when Netscape first came out? Have others seen this problem with caching
proxy servers, and if so, what are the usage conditions like? (I have been
pushing for a campus caching proxy server, so am curious as to whether or not
this might be a problem.)

thanks,
-Robert

I'm going to try the one way guaranteed to prevent the problem from 
occuring, which is to start a packet-trace for the http port, and see 
what really happens. 

One way of checking to see how much of this is queue problems would be
to set the tcp flag that doesn't handshake connections until accept is
really called, and use TLI to log both the initial connection request
and the actual reciept. The downside of this is that it involves the use 
of TLI, which is AT&T's Wisdom teeth for your computer.

We all know that there are far more GIFs on the web than JPEG.  If JPEG 
files are smaller, why wouldn't we want to use them.   What browsers don't 
 support JPEG?

   Yes. We run an SGI machine with Netsite (which is not based off the
   NCSA code). I don't know about NCSA httpd, but in the case of Netsite
   there are processes ready to accept connections which the kernel is
   not giving to them. This led us to suspect kernel-level problems.

   --Rob

I believe I've seen the same sort of thing (incoming connections
timing out, no new connections being logged, CPU and disks dead, main
server process shows up as blocked in accept() if I gcore(1) it and do
a backtrace).  Note that this doesn't seem to be entirely consistent
with the "accept queue backup" story --- if the accept() queue on the
socket is full to bursting, why doesn't the server accept new
connections?

One other piece of puzzling evidence --- intense bursts of connections
don't always provoke the bug.  I try to keep track of peak load here
by logging a histogram of transactions/sec vs. number-of-seconds.  We
routinely log bursts of >10 transactions/sec a few times a day even on
weekends, when this sort of "freeze-up" behavior doesn't seem to have
been a problem.

Incidentally, killing off the server process and restarting it always
gets things moving again (at least it does here), so that action seems
to clear whatever inside the kernel is causing the bottleneck.

This led me to the wild-ass guess that there was some kind of race
condition inside the kernel leading to a missed wakeup call.  On that
theory I put a select() with a one-second timeout in front of the
accept() in standalone_main --- the idea being that if a wakeup() was
missed, the timeout (and subsequently reentering the select) would
rescue the server.

That hack seems to have helped matters, but I'm not sure that it's
gotten rid of the freeze-ups entirely --- I spotted something which
looked an awful lot like the same old freeze on Friday, although this
time the process was waiting in select().  If the bug keeps on showing
up at an annoying rate, the next thing I'll try is closing and
reopening the socket if no connection requests have come in for ten
seconds or so, but that seems a little drastic.

  If you'll so a little more research on the JPEG format, you'll find out 
that it is just a compressed GIF.  So, the main reason why most people 
don't use JPEGs in their Web pages is due to the time it takes to 
overhead in loading the JPEG file.  To some, especially me, it just isn't 
worth it.

Yes, that's true for us too.  I *think* I even
cleared the bottleneck by sending a -1 (HUP)
signal to httpd, but I wasn't entirely sure.

By the way, thanks to everyone who's posted
suggestions and ideas.  Although we haven't 
yet licked the problem, it's nice to see that 
we're the only ones experiencing this.

That's not the whole story (in fact, it's not accurate -- GIF is already 
a compressed format.)  There are several tradeoffs between GIF and JPEG.

 1) Decoding time: JPEG > GIF
 2) Size: JPEG < GIF for complex images, but GIF < JPEG for simple ones
 3) Loss: JPEG is lossy (to varying degrees, depending on compression)
    while GIF is lossless
 4) Image complexity: GIF is 256 color, JPEG 16.7 million 
 5) Browser support: GIF is much more widely supported
 6) Patents: I won't go on about Unisys :-)

Therefore there are uses for each and that's not going to change.  There 
will be no wholesale conversion to JPEG, although there may be wholesale 
conversion away from GIF depending on the progression of Unisys's patent 
assertion on LZW.

You have to be careful to prevent race conditions there. There's a
chance people could get connection refused if they hit your server at
just the right time.

You can also do this without contacting the server, or using URL's.
One problem with this is that you limit yourself to searches that are
applicable to HTML and to document fragments. Say I have a 350MB SGML
document, and I want to search for:

    activists within 20 words of templar

or a database to which I send my natural language query:

    List all the employess with large salaries

What should happen? We need to standardise this functionality (or at
least the mechanisms allowing it), and this whole client side
searching thing is just a subset of this bigger problem.

        I've never configured the NCSA server,  but can't it be run
from inetd?   Modularity helps,  especially in cases like this.
Now there's good reason for  NOT  running a web server from inetd
(keeping program text around,  having data structures loaded,  etc),
but it might help you isolate things if you were able to switch to
inetd mode while chasing this down.   Of course,  it might mean that
everything else served through inetd would hang along with HTTPD.   ;-)

Ummm, huh?  JPEG and GIF have nothing to do with each other at that 
level. The reason many still use GIF is probably threefold:

1) GIF works better for lineart and other things of limited colors and 
sharp edges. JPEG works better for photographs with lots of colors and 
smooth gradients.

2) GIF is older, which means there's more GIF software than JPEG software.

3) JPEG gives better quality images upon decompression in terms of number 
of colors. Since many graphics displays don't support as many colors as 
JPEG provides, decompression has to go thru a color-selection step too, 
which can be slow.

Sub-document addressing is not a hard problem for SGML documents. Have
a look at the TEI schemes, or perhaps the HyTime schemes.

Can someone provide a URL for the online TEI specs?

Also, have a look at <URL:http://www.ebt.com/> for a server that has
sub-document adressing capabilities based on the SGML tree structure.

There are standard SQL exetensions that provide for a limited amount of
full/text query specification. The formulation of the query is only half of
the problem. The more difficult part of the problem (in my opinion) is how do
you handle the "sub-document" addressability for the relevant fragments of
the document to be retrieved or to be highlighted.  Traditional database
approaches to these binary large objects (aka BLOBs) has been to include a
cursor mechanism that permits iteration over blocks of the externally stored
file data. The stateless nature of http would not be efficient for this type
of interaction. What has resulted in the current environment is essentially
an annotation system whereby the server translates the original document
along with the retrieval annotations into a transient document (e.g. a view
of the original document with perhaps highlighted keywords or regions of the
document along with local navigational links) built on the fly. For larger
documents the same annotations that have been constructed remotely also make
sense for local client browser functionality, particularly for systems over
low bandwidth networks.

Won't this mean that the document will never be cached?  Surely it's 
a bad idea to force clients to go to the remote server unnecessarily.  
Won't users have access to (local) date software on their client machine - if not 
a cheap watch!

After a document is frozen on a CDROM, can I go back and impose new 
addressing schemes beyond the original named element of the document?
e.g. the third sentence of the Constitution.

The home page for TEI is <A HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html">
http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html</A>

The full SGML system at EBT addresses the need for authored structural addressability.
The type of subdocument addressability that I am looking for would allow a search
engine to refer to the last paragraph in chapter 2 spanning to the first paragraph
of chapter 4 (potentially spanning 3 html files) as a region of information to be
presented to a user which satisfies a complex "how to" query.

I'd also like to construct complex standing queries about "the president of the 
United States" in the news, which returns a conditional result. The selection 
mechanism for a search engine can be distinct from both the scoring and highlighting
mechanisms. An older document might incorrectly highlight the word "Clinton" if he
was "govenor Clinton" at the time.

This sounds like a very interesting hypothesis.  Suppose all the
pending connections were  half-negotiated.  The queue might be full, so
the server (actually, the OS) would reject new connections, but there
would be no completed connections to process.

Also, what happens if a connection request is sitting in the queue and
the client decides to break the connection before the server gets to
it?  (This may correspond to what happens when Netscape opens a bunch
of connections but the user decides to move to another page, and the
client breaks the connections.)  Do the pending connections stay in the
accept queue, or are they removed?

Can anybody help me with this problem:

I have a plain text file (256 bytes long) that I wish to send via HTTP to a CGI
for processing.
At present I do the following:

Open a socket to the HTTP server (where the CGI is held).
Open the text file for reading and send the following down the socket:

POST /cgi-bin/testprogram
Content-type: text/plain
Content-length: 256
(file gets put here)

The server picks up the POST query and initiates the CGI but it does not set
the Content-type and Content-length environment variables.
Got any ideas?
Am I using the MIME type headers incorrectly?
Is there a better way to do this?

Hi,

The bandwidth savings, when using JPEG for image transfer, are truely amazing.

Please find below the official view of the Independent JPEG group on the differences between, and the uses of, JPEG and GIF image formats.

Best Regards

This is a seriously wrongheaded notion -- about on a par with asserting
that a screwdriver is just an undersized hammer.  JPEG and GIF are
substantially different tools, suited for substantially different jobs.
JPEG works well on truecolor photographs, not at all well on icons and line
drawings, whereas GIF is the reverse.

More complete details on JPEG and GIF can be found in the JPEG FAQ
<http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/jpeg-faq/top.html>.

GIF is terminally ill now that Unisys has decided to start demanding LZW
patent royalties from authors of GIF-using software.  A group led by
Thomas Boutell is developing a replacement lossless format called PNG.
My bet is that PNG will replace GIF on the Web before the year is out.
Progressive JPEG support will probably appear in WWW browsers in the same
time frame.  PNG and JPEG will both be used heavily on the future Web,
each for its own appropriate type of picture.

Hi all,

I think we are moving a touch away from the point here. The original proposal
was for a quick and easy search method. Agreed that it should probably 
expandable in the future, but I think that there are 2 issues here. 

1) A quick search. This is probably similar to the <A NAME="..."></A>
thing that we have all been using to jump to points. If I recall the original
suggestion it was that we could specify a *SINGLE* keyword and use it 
to do a textstream search of the document to jump to a point. Actually 
thinking about this last night, I would perhaps propose a slight change to
this. Something like:

	http://a/doc.html#text=string	        A simple text search

Then we could expand to say:

	http://a/doc.html#image=image.gif	Jump to a picture
	http://a/doc.html#url=//host/file	Jump to a given link
	http://a/doc.html#div=number	 	I always wondered what to
						use <DIV n> for :)

which we could then use to bring us back a full circle to (you guessed it)

	http://a/doc.html#name=tag		Which is the same as:
	http://a/doc.html#tag		


2) The full document search (including child documents). I leave this up to
all to come up with there own scheme. Remember that the _original_ HTTP
spec mentioned being able to extract areas from within images too. I had
a few ideas on that but trying to work them through came up with hurdles at
every angle.

But this is a very interesting topic, and I dont think that however it turns

Referencing Dan Connolly's excellent summary of Harvest:
	http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/

There is a subsystem called Nebula by Mic Bowman (a member of the Harvest
team) that allows for complex standing queries.  I believe they are still 
in progress on putting Harvest over Nebula.

Extract from:
	http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/technical.html 
"With Nebula, each object is represented as a set of attribute/value
pairs. There is a separate index (and possibly mechanism) per attribute
tag. Nebula also supports a view notion involving a standing query against
object base. This allows information to be filtered based on query
predicates. It is easy to refine and extend the predicates over time, and
observe changes interactively."

It could be that you are not sending the HTTP/1.0 request line properly.  Try 
appending " HTTP/1.0" to the first line (and also make sure you're sending CRLF 
pairs to terminate lines) like so:

POST /cgi-bin/testprogram HTTP/1.0
Content-type: text/plain
Content-length: 256
(file gets put here)

I think the server is probably not realizing you're doing HTTP/1.0, and assumes 
you're trying a 0.9 request since it is malformed.  If you plan on getting any 
data back, you might also want to send some Accept: lines.

Beware. On small images and computer generated images (particularly things
like logos) JPEGs are larger, not smaller, than GIFs.  Try it.

Which isn't to say that JPEG's aren't great, but not for everything (and
particularly not without an alpha channel for masking).

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.

   This sounds like a very interesting hypothesis.  Suppose all the
   pending connections were  half-negotiated.  The queue might be full, so
   the server (actually, the OS) would reject new connections, but there
   would be no completed connections to process.

This matches what we see... and, incidentally, if true, it makes for a
fairly neat denial-of-service attack against Unix-based TCP servers.
(If Mallet wants to disable rlogin and telnet on a machine he's in the
process of subverting, he just has to make his machine,
badguy.mallet.com, deliberately initiate five connections on those
ports and fail to complete the handshake).

Things that make you go hmmm...

Lemme add one more: those who are concerned about their valuable images
being pirated and misused (especially commercially) may choose to put up
the lesser quality GIF versions than the much better (if compressed
properly) JPEG files. GIF allows one to display his/her work while at the
same time limiting the potential for infringement -- especially in a print
environment. On-line use is another story.

   You have to be careful to prevent race conditions there. There's a
   chance people could get connection refused if they hit your server at
   just the right time.

   --Rob

I'm actually not worried about this during prime time --- if we
haven't got a connection for twenty seconds, we can be pretty sure
there is a problem, and those people would get their connection
refused anyway.  Even if the problem is just our building's line to
the rest of campus going briefly offline, that in itself is likely to
result in a bunch of incomplete handshakes, which can and do persist
long after the line goes back up.

Off-hours are another story, however --- it is entirely possible that
in the off-hours, there's simply no one that wants to connect for
twenty seconds.  So if connection attempts do come in at *precisely*
twenty-second intervals, people will get screwed.  This means that if
I throw this kludge into my server, I'm going to have to make it
somehow sensitive to the time as well.

Phase-of-the-moon bugs, anyone?  Sigh...

rst

PS --- another shot-in-the-dark question:

   Does the TCP spec actually mandate that accept(2), or the
   equivalent, not return until the entire three-way handshake is
   complete?  Are there TCP stacks with different behavior?

The TCP specification does not mandate any API behaviour; However, all BSD
derived implementations that I know of use this behavious by default. Solaris
2.2 and above do allow you to change this behaviour by using ndd to change
one of variables for /dev/tcp (I think the variable is 
tcp_old_urp_interpretation, but the only place it's documented is in 
"TCP Illustrated", which is at home.)

I don't think there's an interface to this functionality through the sockets
API, but I hope I'm mistaken. There's definitely support for this in the 
TLI interface, which has a two stage accept mechanism - normally this is 
just obnoxious brain-damage, but it might be useful for debugging purposes
in cases like this.

What about "The Bride stripped bare by her bachelor's, even." - short
title, "The Large Glass."  Duchamp only produced a few major works and then
gave up art for chess - perhaps if he'd been alive today he'd have become a
computer programmer - better still a technical writer.  8-)

Dear All

Up until now I use a bare ASCII editor to create HTML - I havent
yet found an editor that produces the code as I like it, and I'm
afraid I see an aesthetic appeal in well presented code.
OK I Confess: I wear my little W3 socks in bed (well I am British!)

HOWEVER:
Tables are Oh So useful, and Oh So painful to code; so far I've done
my CV (no surprises that was the first thing I tried!) and that took
an age!!

SO :
I'll give up my aesthetic pretentions for an editor/macro that can
hack tables, if anyone knows of one. Ideally a macro for Excel would
seem to be the answer, but I'm not a basic programmer and would still
like to keep some kind of life:-)

Any suggestions.

PS Anyone know when Netscape will support Tables, a major omision
IMHO.

I agree. Logos and flat line art should not be subjected to a lossy compression technique such as JPEG.

Before this flamewar reaches meltdown :-

1) JPEGs is good, all browsers should support them pronto :-)

2) GIF has advantages over JPEG in some areas but is unsatisfactory because :-
	1) Limited to 8 bit colour.
	2) Patented *VARIANT* of algorithm - had compuserve known they 
		could have avoided the problem. but thats submarine patents
		for you.

We need a replacement for GIF because JPEG is no use for editing, each compress/
decompress cycle degrades the image quality.We could use lossless JPEG but
that is a different story.

Neither format has gamma correction values built into the system which is a pain
for browsers like Arena which do gama correction themselves.


Compuserve (and many others) are kicking arround a spec for a GIF24 standard.
I think we should let them get on with it :-)

That's a bit of a tough one, but everyone in the search business is looking
at redefining the definition of a document in order to accomodate searches
against logical units within logical units.  Soon, one might search each
server as if it were a single document, for example, in order to select
which servers to search further.

This is where knowledgebases come in handy, to tout our technology for a moment.

I'm not sure that I see where these issues would have a direct effect on
implementations of client-side highlighting.  The information about what to
highlight would still have to come from the search engine.

This approach still seems to be server and client based rather than
information or document based.  It seems to me that the information that
might be relevant to any user could come from a variety of different
servers as well as a variety of documents from those servers.  Thus a query
might result in several USENET posts, several html files and a couple of
pieces of text from a gopher hole.  This sort of searching requires some
form of information addressing along the lines of the Dewey Decimal System
in use in Libraries.

Dewey assigns *all* printed material - books, papers, magazines, etc - a
unique serial number based on the content.  The code follows a three
numbers, full stop, any number of numbers.  The first three numbers
represent 1) a category 2) a subcategory 3) a sub-subcategory.  Thus number
513 might represent 1) 5 = science 2) 1 = maths  3) 3 = Calculus.  The
numbers after the full stop can subdivide further the category of
information the document contains and also provide author and publisher
information.

I recognise that asking USENET posters to attach the correct Dewey number
to their posts is unreasonable but if this approach is also wedded to a
keyword system then servers could also have access to reference files of
information codes that index builders could then add to document indices. 
A search of cyberspace for "calculus" information would therefore result in
all 513 information blocks to be indexed and a menu returned to the client,
"maths" would result in all 51- information being menued and "science" would
result in all 5-- information blocks being menued.

Does anyone think that encoding information in cyberspace in this way is
possible?

BTW - Please excuse the Subject:.  I think client side searching is somewhat
off base as indexing is, by definition, a centralising function and therefore
the fief of the server - whatever that server is.  I "replied" - sue me.

Alastair.

JPEG is not a compressed GIF!  JPEG is an excellent format to compress true
color natural images.  JPEG images may or may not be smaller than GIF images
depending on how high the compression parameters are set but JPEG will generally
be smaller for most images.  The lossy compression technique used by JPEG may
blur important details of an image such as fine text.  JPEG may take 
longer to display than a GIF image depending on the speed and color resolution
of the client.  Information providers have to make plenty of decisions on
how to present their information, JPEG vs GIF is just one more.

I seem to remember that masks were briefly discussed late last year. We've
implemented a 1 bit mask as an extension to both <FIG> and <IMG> and it 
allows one to do wonderful things with images, especially JPEGs, where the
background color is _never_ correct. A full alpha channel would be 
even better (but that's for another day). Is there any interest in adding
a MASK attribute to the HTML 3.0 spec?

To create transparent GIF file, I use the "netpbm" package in UNIX,
and "Transparency" in Macintosh.

In the netpbm package,

	1. giftopnm foo.gif > foo.ppm

	2. ppmtogif -transparent #rgb foo.ppm > foo-trans.gif

	where '#rgb' indicate the color you make transparent,
	e.g. #ffffff (white).

In Transparency, you click the image, selecting the color you make
transparent, and then "Save As GIF89...".

The short answer is to use netpbm (formerly called pbmplus), which I
think you can get from ftp.x.org.  Here's a very simple little script
which takes a GIF image and makes the color white transparent in the
output (with the file arg renamed with "T_" as a prefix).

Subject: forms for testing and CGI routines which "grade" them?

For some "virtual field trips" we're developing for high school
students, we want to have comprehension tests.

I.e., present multiple-choice tests as forms.  Clicking on Submit would
send the results to a CGI program for grading, which would give the
student immediate feedback.

My thinking is that the same cgi program should work for several tests,
matching the form info against different test key files with the
correct answer for each specific test.

Would really appreciate pointers to anyone who has done this, or might
be working on something like this.

    Startup company looking for part time "net hacks", gifted students, or
    moonlighting professionals to provide sub-contract services for us,
    and to our client base.  
    
    This is an excellent opportunity for a working professional who wants 
    to do some software development "on the side" and remain anonymous.  
    Other potential candidates might be "gifted" students, or others, who 
    know their way around the net, and wish to suppliment their income.

    Skills needed immediately are (any of the following):

	* Detailed Perl Knowledge
	* Detailed HTML/WEB Page Design and Creation
	* Knowledge of Mail, Sendmail, etc...
	* Writing Unix Shell Scripts (Borne, Bash, Korn)
	* C and/or C++ programming
	* Majordomo Expertise
	* Familiarity with other Unix tools, Sed, Awk, etc is helpful.
	* (If you wish to develop some of these skills, we can give you
	  a project to work on which you can learn as you go.  Compensation
	  will be based on the project as a whole, when completed.)

    Compensation can be based by the project, or by the hour.  Persons
    may work as either part-time employees, sub-contractors, or "other".

    Fringe benefits:

	* You will receive a free, personal account on our server, which
	  is connected directly to the net.  We have all the desireable net 
	  services.  You may connect to our host via telnet, www, ftp, etc.
	  A few number of 28,800 v34 modems are available for persons needing
	  PPP/SLIP access. 
	* Work from wherever you have net access.
	* Work anytime of the day or night.
	* Our clients will not deal directly with you, if you wish
	  to reamin anonymous.
	* Very flexible compensation plans.

    Please send information about yourself, your skills and a short resume',
    if you have one, along with your salary requirements, (all information 
    will be kept confidential) to:

Another way todo "conferencing" (same time different hosts) without
"cgi-bin" stuff is described briefly under:
	http://www.eit.com/software/mosaic/shared-mosaic.html

The current version of shared-mosaic requires patching of Mosaic 
sources, however can also be done without patching, namely via the 
CCI stuff. This conferencing model currently supports a live,
interactive but view-only session.

I apologize in advance if my definition of "conferencing" is different
from yours. Few beta binaries are however available at:
	ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/share/mosaic/beta/*

This work is currently in progress, therefore if something breaks
please feel free to report problems to me, i'll be happy to work with 
you.
No flames, please.

I have been developing an AutoCAD tutorial for a while now using
On-Line marking and Logging. Three different units have now followed
the course at both Undergrad and Postgrad levels, and all seem to
appreciate this approach. It is still quite rough around the edges,
but at least indicates *an* approach.

Is the  URL for the index; its pretty obvious from there.

Check out my "stock-ticker" application called "Media On
Demand" Server available at:
	http://www.eit.com/cgi-bin/mediaform

for a display/control of live audio/video media's. This has been
tested only using Mosaic (and not Netscape). You will also need
external viewer applications for audio/video.

	    	    CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
                                
	6th ASIS SIG/CR Classification Research Workshop:
  		  An interdisciplinary meeting 

The American Society for Information Science Special Interest Group on 
Classification Research (ASIS SIG/CR) invites submissions for the 6th 
ASIS Classification Research Workshop, to be held at the 58th Annual 
Meeting of ASIS in Chicago, IL.  The workshop will take place Sunday, 
October 8th, 1995, 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. ASIS '95 continues through 
Thursday, October 12th. 

The CR Workshop is designed to be an exchange of ideas among active 
researchers with interests in the creation, development, management, 
representation, display, comparison, compatibility, theory, and 
application of classification schemes. Emphasis will be on semantic 
classification, in contrast to statistically based schemes. Topics 
include, but are not limited to:

- Warrant for concepts in classification schemes.
- Concept acquisition.
- Basis for semantic classes.
- Automated techniques to assist in creating classification schemes.
- Statistical techniques used for developing explicit semantic classes.
- Relations and their properties.
- Inheritance and subsumption.
- Knowledge representation schemes.
- Classification algorithms.
- Procedural knowledge in classification schemes.
- Reasoning with classification schemes.
- Software for management of classification schemes.
- Interfaces for displaying classification schemes.
- Data structures and programming languages for classification schemes.
- Image classification.
- Comparison and compatibility between classification schemes. 
- Applications such as subject analysis, natural language understanding, 
information retrieval, expert systems.
- Representation and access on the Internet

The CR Workshop welcomes submissions from various disciplines. Those 
interested in participating are invited to submit a short (1-2 page 
single-spaced) position paper summarizing substantive work that has been 
conducted in the above areas or other areas related to semantic 
classification schemes, and a statement briefly outlining the reason for 
wanting to participate in the workshop. Submissions may include 
background papers as attachments. Participation will be of two kinds: 
presenter and regular participant. Those selected as presenters will be 
invited to submit expanded versions of their position papers and to speak 
to those papers in brief presentations during the workshop.   Submitted 
position papers will be refereed for acceptance for publication in the 
proceedings.  Some of the accepted papers will be selected for an 
expanded version in the proceedings.  Authors of expanded papers will be 
invited to speak to their papers in brief presentations during the 
workshop.  All position papers (both expanded and short papers) will be

Release 3.5 of the Dienst server is now running at Cornell University

The Dienst development group at Cornell has finished development of release
3.5 of the Dienst software.  Dienst is a protocol and server for providing
distributed document servers over the World Wide Web. Dienst provides three
digital library services; repository services that store and  deliver
multi-format documents, index servers that index meta-information on documents
and provide search  engines over these indexes, and user interfaces services
that provide a  human front-end to the two other services. Multiple Dienst
servers interoperate to provide a logically uniform collection to the user,
even though the physical collection is distributed. Each individual Dienst
server "knows" about other sites, and visa-versa,  by periodically polling a
central meta-server site.  

Documents served by Dienst are each identified by a universally unique document
identifier, or docid. This docid is partitioned into a publisher name and
number. Each document has, at a minimum, bibliographic information stored in a
tagged format. In addition, a  document may have serveral other representation
formats (e.g., PostScript, HTML, TIFF, etc).  

The new release includes a number of functional and performance enhancements
over previous versions including a new search engine, support for full-text
searching, gateways to other document indexes, and improved installation.

The Cornell server is available at http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu.

Masks should definitely, positively, absolutely NOT be an attribute in
HTML!  Transparency information is part of the image, not of the document,
and to the greatest extent possible the addition of more ill-designed
hacks to HTML to make up for the deficiencies of other formats should be
avoided.  I'd much rather see TIFF being used (or some new form of JFIF

that makes it worth saving from becoming an even bigger pile of half-
assed kludges than it already is.

(I don't like the <OVERLAY> element either.  This is properly the
province of a simple vector graphics format.  If HTML tries to do
everything itself, it will quickly become as huge, unweildy, and
difficult to understand as the U.S. Federal Government.)

Embedded transparency is OK for somethings, but not for everything. One
of the tricks we use is to reuse a single image (our reader is smart
about caching images across pages) with different masks to achieve 
"interesting" effects. Obviously this can't be done with embedded 
masks. A JPG and several 1-bit GIF masks are much smaller than several JPGs.

TIFF is unusable because it has lousy compression (compared to JPG or
fractals). And a new JFIF format is something the world doesn't need.

As a final point, we intend to ultimately support a full alpha channel,
not just a 1 bit mask. Since not all browsers will support this, why
burden the data channel with useless information by embedding it in the
image file. Better to let the browser choose whether to fetch both the
image and the mask.

For the last couple of weeks I have been running around like a chicken 
with my head cut off trying to figure out the best way to implement a 
stream-based publishing scheme into a system, HTTP, which is most ideally 
designed for static archives of documents.  I think I've found a 
solution.  I think some of you may shoot me, but I'm willing to take that 
risk.

I propose a change to the HTTP spec which will require no changes to 
servers and a small change to clients.  I propose an additional header to 
the request and response, "State:".  When a client fetches a URL, if the 
server returns a State: field in its header, the client stores the value 
of that field with the URL.  When the client revisits the URL, it sends 
along that State: value, and the server can respond with a new value to be 
associated with the URL.  

Here's an example of its utility in a stream-based context.  Assume that 
Flux is a stream of content where new bits are posted every couple of 
hours, and the actual file is a script that assembles Flux bits into a page.

John goes and visits HotWired for the first time.  He goes to the section 
called Flux.

C: GET /Flux HTTP/1.0

The server sees no state value associated with it, so it returns 
the default page for Flux, which is comprised of bits from the last two 
weeks.  In this case, it's items 1-29.

S: Content-type: text/html
   State: 1-29
   <file with 29 elements>

Now, John comes back a couple of days later, in which time 5 new items 
were posted to flux. 

C: GET /Flux HTTP/1.0
   State: 1-29
S: Content-type: text/html
   State: 1-34
   <file with just 5 elements>

Okay, now it's been two weeks, in which time 15 new pieces were posted to 
flux.  John first goes to a full-text-search page and looks for ISDN.  He 
gets back URL's pointing to bits 39 and 50 in Flux, among others (the URL 
being constructed by the search engine).  So he visits Flux:

C: GET /Flux?39,50
   State: 1-34
S: Content-type: text/html
   State: 1-34,39,50
   <file>

(by the way, /Flux is a script, and since the URL's are generated by 
scripts, there's no magic happening on the client side for this!  The CGI 
spec mandates that extra headers are encoded in the CGI environment, so 
servers would get this data by looking in the environment for HTTP_STATE.)

He goes and does another search, this time for McDonalds, and gets 
references to items 22,45, and 50.  So he goes to that page:

C: GET /Flux?22,45,50
   State: 1-34,39,50
S: Content-type: text/html
   State: 1-34,39,45,50

it can be totally up to the script to determine whether it should also 
send along items 22 and 50 given that the person has already seen them.
Think of this as exactly comparable to when a news reader tells an NNTP 
server "hey, I have articles 1-34,39,45,50, what else is there?".

There's no reason why other types of data can't be encoded in this URL:
time/date info, customization info, etc.  Browsers should be able to clear
state info, and state expiration should coincide with URL expiration.  The
onus is on the servers to keep the amount of state info to a minimum - the
spec could declare something like 5K as the maximum amount of state info
allowed, unless there is a limit in HTTP headers themselves.  The encoding
of the information must be the same as HTTP headers are allowed. 

I can't see any problems with security that aren't encountered by people 
using news readers in the first place.  The only insecurities I see are 
situations where people do not use their browser from the same account 
all the time (like in a macintosh classroom or something) where those 
values could contain highly personalized and private data, but we are 
hopefully moving away from those systems anyways (we'll need to for real 
public annotations).  It will allow *any* publisher to do the kinds of mass 
customizations which are currently only possible using password-protected 
authentication and storing state data on the server side, like we do.

To sum up, this requires no changes to the server (since it could be 
managed by scripts - but obviously a stream-based publishing engine built 
into the server could use this intelligently), and minimal changes to the 
client (clients keep around a history of visits to URL's anyways, this is 
simply associating a value with that key).  

So, what do you think?  I can almost hear Tim BL and others grumbling now 
about how GET requests are supposed to be idempotent... I understand the 
need for that, but I have a hard time seeing how else something like this 
could be implemented.

Lemme add one more: those who are concerned about their valuable images
being pirated and misused (especially commercially) may choose to put up
the lesser quality GIF versions than the much better (if compressed
properly) JPEG files. GIF allows one to display his/her work while at the
same time limiting the potential for infringement -- especially in a print
environment. On-line use is another story.

To be clear, what you're proposing is an additional mechanism for  
storing state on the *client* side.  As far as I can see, we already  
have good mechanisms for this.  Even though the most flexible ones  
are HTML-specific, any format which supports URL-based links can play  
the game.  And as long as the client caches (or the user saves)  
documents containing such links, the client-side state will even  
automatically persist across client sessions.

>    State: 1-29
> S: Content-type: text/html
>    State: 1-34
>    <file with just 5 elements>

How is your scheme essentially different from either of the following  
two scenarios, the first of which will work with any URL-based  
hyperformat?   The only difference I see is that your scheme relies  
on client caching of meta-info, which may be problematic (see below);  
while the following schemes rely either on either client caching of  
history, or on manual saving of documents (available in any browser).

C: GET /Flux/1-29 HTTP/1.0
S: Content-type: text/html \n\n
   Item 30 ... Item 31 ... Item 32 ... Item 33 ... Item 34 ...
   Save this document to read <A HREF="/Flux/1-34">new articles</A>

C: POST /cgi-bin/Flux HTTP/1.0
   Content-type: application/x-www-url-encoded \n\n
   state=1-29
S: Content-type: text/html \n\n
   Item 30 ... Item 31 ... Item 32 ... Item 33 ... Item 34 ...
   <FORM...><INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Read new articles">
   <INPUT NAME="state" TYPE="hidden" VALUE="1-34"></FORM>

Your more elaborate examples can be emulated in similar fashion.

I'm not sure that it's a good idea to associate State meta-info with  
URLs, as opposed to individual documents and links.  What if I wanted  
to go back and switch to reading latest batch of articles with  
different output filters enabled (or whatever)?  It would seem  
natural to turn back to the page where I clicked to get this batch,  
and then select a different option.  That wouldn't have the expected  
result if the State meta-info is associated to the URL rather than  
the link.


In any case, I feel that all of this unrelated to the need for  
"stateful connections" in HTTP, because the purpose of stateful  
connections is to support *server* side state.  It is the lack of  
support for both server-side state and client-side computation that  
(in my opinion) is holding the Web back from becoming the world's  
coolest distributed object environment.

To be sure, these are the better features to omit on the first pass.   
But I think that's where W3C needs to be putting some serious effort.   
It looks like proprietary solutions could soon dominate if W3C  
doesn't take the initiative.  I'd be eager to work with them on such  
a project.

Sorry to bomb the list with this (especially since I don't read www-talk...)
but I'm getting desperate.  I have what's got to be a common question, but
in several hours of hunting around the Web today and scrounging through
www-talk archives I haven't been able to get an answer to the following.

Is their one universally acceptable (I hesitate to use the term "correct")
way to embed "&" or other special characters in HREF attributes?  Here's a
specific example: I generate lists of CGI-type anchors in response to a
number of different queries to the Musi-Cal database, for instance, <a
href="http://www/calendar.com/cgi-bin?city=Basking%20Ridge&state=NJ">Basking
Ridge</a>.

This worked fine until a WinMosaic 2.0.0a9 user reported that it wasn't
working.  After scratching around off and on for a few days, I saw a note in
one of the comp.infosystems.www newsgroups that said to use "&amp;" instead.
I tried it.  So now I have <a
href="http://www/calendar.com/cgi-bin?city=Basking%20Ridge&amp;state=NJ">Basking
Ridge</a>.  Worked fine with Netscape 1.0N.  (Doesn't everything?
<blink>:-)</blink>).  Worked fine with X Mosaic 2.1 and Lynx 2.3 as well. I
checked with my user.  Worked fine with him.  Okey-dokey.  Looks good. Into
production.  Now another user's browser is choking on "&amp;" (can't recall
which one at the moment - it's sort of immaterial at this point).  He
suggested "%26" instead.  ARRRRGGGGH!

Before I make another apparently major blunder, is there a single
universally accepted version of "&" I can embed in my HREFs that the current
versions of all browsers (e.g., I really don't care about X Mosaic 2.1
anymore, although I still use it occasionally).  Failing that, is there a
list somewhere of what the various browsers will accept?

I started writing Python code to handle all the friggin' HTTP_USER_AGENT
formats available -- what a mess! (HTTP_USER_AGENT, not Python) -- so I
could work around this problem dynamically.  I have been laboring under the
assumption that the column labelled "CharAmpersand" in

	Soon after I initiated the Web Developer's Virtual Library at my
	site, I started getting random technical questions from visitors
	who evidently thought I might have some good answers.. later, I
	decided that I might as well give this Q&A service a name, so I
	labelled it "Ask Dr.Web". Well, of course, that only encourages
	everyone, and now I'm getting several questions a day.

	The problem with this is that to deal adequately with each question
	takes time, and I don't have enough to spare. So, I'd like to expand
	the "practice" with a few volunteer partners. I would estimate that
	with the load divided between us, your time commitment need not
	exceed 10 - 15 minutes/day.

	If you are interested in helping out, please contact me, and unless
	you're a household name (e.g. for writing the HTML 2.0 spec :*) then
	please provide some evidence that you are a well-qualified web doctor.
	Thanks!

WWW-TALK seems to be alive again. Has mail been lost whilst it was dead
or is the new machine slowly going through the backlog? If this message
appears soon, I assume the queue has been lost - otherwise, there's going 
to be a lot of full mailboxes on monday.

Oh dear, it seems that mail has been lost :-(


At least the mailing list is back.  After all the trouble at
CERN it's amazing it came back this quickly.  I wonder if some
disgruntled employee ripped the wires out the back of the mail
machine.  I not sure which his worse-postal workers, or particle
physicists...

I apologize to those of you to whom this request is inappropriate, but
I'm stumped. I'm having a truly terrible time trying to determine what
the real algorithm is for basic authentication. The 1.0 draft says uuencoded,
the Cern pages refer me to 1421, but when I try these approaches the output
doesn't match the encoding created by current browsers. I know I'm
missing something really basic. If someone with more knowledge and a
clearer head would throw me some pointers I'd really appreciate it.

The correct algorithm is base64 -- the same base64 that is described
in the MIME spec (RFC 1521) and PEM (RFC 1421), but without any line breaks. 
This is fully described in the next revision of the HTTP/1.0 draft.

I couldn't send this earlier as the www-talk listserver
was down. 

   The WWW Interface to WEBHOUND is ready. You no longer need to
   install the modified browser or client to use WEBHOUND.
 
   http://webhound.www.media.mit.edu/projects/webhound/www-face/
 
   Please use it to seed the database with your favourite documents.

I'm currently working on making the document filtering algortithm
more accurate. I'm also working on making the client both much 
easier to use as well as trivial to install. 
Meanwhile please use the WWW interface.
 
Comments, feedback appreciated.

ps: For those of you who didnt read my earlier message, WEBHOUND is 
a WWW document filtering system that works on the principle of 
automated collaborative filtering. Info is available through the URL
above.

The past couple of months have seen our NCSA server performance degrade
considerably.  The included patch should improve most servers, but 
those with large yp group files and/or those experiencing multiple 
hits/second should see the most gain.

The included patch gave us an order of magnitude improvement.  
Technical details as well as the diff file are included below.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Kipp Jones

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Details:

We had been experiencing considerable delay on our server connections.
Discovered that it was the server was doing an initgroups call for
each fork'd process.  As we use yp, and our group file keeps growing,
AND yp is single threaded, all of the accesses were getting queued
up waiting for ypserv.

We tweaked the code to allow us to only do the initgroups
call once, and use that information the remaining times.  As the
uid/gid is always the same, this is sufficient.

The improvement for us was in the range of 2-3 seconds/connection, a
very considerable amount.  The performance improvement experienced
by others will vary depending on the number of hits, the size of the
group file, and the yp activity.

Other than some messsages from the www-talk list, I have not received mail
from ANY of the CERN mailing lists for about 3 weeks. What kind of trouble
has CERN been having, and does anybody know if any of the other mailing
lists are back (html, announce, etc.)?

Any answers on this would be much appreciated. I heard a very unfounded
rumour that CERN is pulling out of the Web project. I hope to God this is
not true!

Cecilia

As far as I know, it is true. CERN is pulling out of Web developement. 
However, all is not lost. WWW3 is taking over what CERN is leaving 
behind. Recently, I received e-mail advising me that any links I may have 
to info.cern.ch  should be changed to www.w3.org.

Yes, it is true that CERN is not the home of the Web project
any longer.  It has passed to INRIA in France and MIT in the
US, who are both involved in the W3 Consortium.  If you would
like more detail, read my article in GNN's Netnews:

I've raised this same issue a couple times, most recently on html-wg,
at:

http://www.acl.lanl.gov/HTML_WG/html-wg-95q1.messages/0430.html

The best answer we came up with is to write: &#38;

Some (broken) browser's don't grok, so there's no way to please
everybody today.

There was a nice folloup that gave a summary of the state of the art:

<H1><a href="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a> and <a href="http://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a> join forces in World-Wide Web Core
Development
</H1>

<HR>
As is well known, the <a href="http://info.cern.ch">World-Wide Web</a> (WWW) originated at <a href="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a>
with Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues.  It is now the information system which is largely driving the Internet, and which has a
substantial global business potential for the near future.  The World-Wide Web was conceived as a communication tool for the widely
dispersed scientific community of High-Energy Physics.  It is destined to become essential for the Global Information
Infrastructure, and is thus a prime example of important spin-off from pure scientific research.
<P>

The Web, used by millions of people on the Internet, is in a continual process of enhancement, driven by new techniques and by
applications with differing demands.  Up to now CERN, in its pioneering role, has provided the technical reference point and
invested substantial resources in the development of WWW.  It is clear that its further development as an informatics project now
needs to be undertaken in a wider context.  In this spirit CERN has been working with the European Commission on the definition of a
project, in collaboration with parallel activities at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> in the USA.
<P>

The recent <a href="http://www.cern.ch/Press/Releases94/PR16.94E_LHC-Council.html">approval</a> of the <a
href="http://www.cern.ch/CERN/LHC/LHCwelcome.html">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a> project implies that CERN needs to concentrate
its resources on efforts directly relevant to the future collider and its experimental programme.  CERN intends to remain a major
user of WWW, which is seen as an essential tool for the scientific community, and CERN has a continued interest in its technical
stability and evolution.  Thus CERN will continue to be involved in developments of particular interest to its community, while
envisaging a change of focus of its efforts with a corresponding reduction of involvement in more general developments.
<P>

CERN and the <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/en/home.html">European Commission</a> wish to ensure a strong European presence in WWW
development as well as a single set of standards for the technology.
<P>

<a href="http://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a> with its wide variety of advanced informatics projects and a long history of basic software
development, already contributes to many Europe-wide programmes.  It is also involved in a variety of web-related research projects
including structured document editing, content routing, multicasting browsers, and integration of Object-Oriented databases.
<P>

INRIA has played a significant role in the development of the Internet in France and Europe and is willing to assume
responsibilities in the standardisation and the promotion of the World-Wide Web.
In agreement with CERN, INRIA has therefore accepted to host the European WebCore project with funding from the Commission.  The
project will tackle such issues as:
<UL>
<LI>evolution of the Web components specifications,
<LI>development of reference code,
<LI>information services on the Web,
<LI>promotion and dissemination in Europe.
</UL>
In the early phases of this project, CERN will collaborate with INRIA, to provide a smooth transition and ensure continuity of
developments and services for the benefit of the user community.
CERN is confident that the Webcore project will play a key role in the participation of our continent in the Information Society.
<P>
<HR>
CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, has its headquarters in Geneva. At present, its Member States are Austria,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the
Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Israel, the Russian Federation, Turkey, Yugoslavia (status
suspended after UN embargo, June 1992), the European Commission and Unesco have observer status.

   From: Russel Kipp Jones <kipp@cc.gatech.edu>

   We had been experiencing considerable delay on our server connections.
   Discovered that it was the server was doing an initgroups call for
   each fork'd process.  As we use yp, and our group file keeps growing,
   AND yp is single threaded, all of the accesses were getting queued
   up waiting for ypserv.

   We tweaked the code to allow us to only do the initgroups
   call once, and use that information the remaining times.  As the
   uid/gid is always the same, this is sufficient.

FWIW, there's more in the way of speed increases where that came from,
and some of them are fairly easy to arrange for.  On each connection,
the NCSA server:

*) Talks to the nameserver --- yet another opportunity for YP to
   serialize you.  I'm not sure how to fix this *portably*, but
   cacheing the hostnames of recently seen clients in shared memory
   eases things somewhat.  Compiling with -DMINIMAL_DNS keeps the
   server from talking to the nameserver at all, and is a simpler and
   better option for those who can live with it.

*) Tries to open a whole lot of .htaccess files which aren't there.
   People running close to the edge can get around this by turning off
   the .htaccess checks entirely with an AllowOverride None at the
   right spot in access.conf.  This may be a substantial win for those
   afflicted with AFS.  (The checks for symlinks at every directory
   are also a potential source of overhead, though in that case,
   things may be better simply because the directories in question
   actually exist, and so kernel machinery like the namei cache works).

There are a few more obvious speed improvements which are harder to
arrange for (you have to change some of the server code), but the
payoffs, at least for the first listed hack below, are substantial:

*) Reads the request and MIME header from the client character by
   character, taking a context-switch into and out of the kernel on
   each.  This is a MAJOR performance hit, and easy to kludge around,
   but you do have to change the server code.  It's only mildly hard
   to fix right.

*) Opens the locale database to find out the names of the months, and
   opens some other file to find the time zone.  (Actually, the C
   library does this behind httpd's back, but the effect is the same).

   I got rid of this overhead by doing a few dummy time conversions
   before starting to listen on the socket --- this initializes the C
   library time-conversion code in the parent process, and so the
   children don't have to do it themselves after the fork().

I've fixed most of the above in the server I'm running (all except
.htaccess files, which require some code cleanup to get right), and
that gets you close to the end of the line --- much improvement beyond
that will probably come only by eliminating the fork on every
transaction.  (The overhead of fork() is difficult to measure directly,
but it shows up indirectly in some of my other measurements, and it
seems to be large).

That's only after some cleanups, though --- the standard NCSA server
spends most of its time figuring out what groups "nobody" is in, over
and over and over...

rst

PS --- your patch has a *very* minor bug --- if the server rereads the
       config files, it doesn't change the group info, even though
       User might have changed in httpd.conf, and the appropriate
       groups might have changed in any event.  This is never likely
       to come up in practice, but I'm a little compulsive about these
       things.

[1] If you really want to do this right, at least on SunOS, you can
    recv the header with MSG_PEEK instead of reading it, and then only
    read those bytes out of the kernel buffers which actually contain
    the header, leaving the rest for a CGI script.  This handles POST
    right, as well as GET.  David Robinson came up with this idea and
    has actually coded it up.  Or, you could do as the CERN server does
    --- buffer the client socket as usual, and then pipe the contents
    of the buffer to any script that wants to see them, but that's more
    work starting from the existing NCSA code.

Hi
I hope this is the correct forum for this question.
Can any one tell me how many people at one time can 
access a Web site with the following setup:
Linux ver 1.0.9
NCSA HTTPD ver 1.3
386SX with 16 MB RAM
 None of the software will give me this information so I would 
be grateful for your assistance.

Thanks to all who sent out info on the transfer from CERN to INRIA. It was
rather reassuring.

It appears, then, that the W3 Consortium now provides the Web documents
previously stored at CERN. Consequently, all references to info.cern.ch
should be changed to www.w3.org.

It also appears that the consortium is taking over the CERN mailing lists,
with the mailing address for sending subscription, etc. commands being
listproc@mail.w3.org and the mailing list for www-talk now being
www-talk@www19.w3.org.

However, I am only receiving mail from the www-talk list. Anyone have any
ideas about the status of the announce, html, security and rdb lists?

Thanks again to all,

Regards,

Cecilia

IMHO the bottleneck is likely the link speed and nature of the connection.
You probably are using SLIP or PPP connection with a 14.4 modem with Van
Jacobson compression, thereby getting 38,800 to 56,000 bps.   Such a setup
is slow for a browser platform; it must be excrutiating for those who
browsing a server running under those conditions.  The bottom line for the
provider (as well as the browser) is that you can't have enough bandwidth
from the Internet to your PC.  At the least get a 28.8 V34 modem (NOT VFC)
and V34 service from your Internet Service Provider.

There are no accidents, just unintended consequences.

   From: Russel Kipp Jones <kipp@cc.gatech.edu>
     
   We had been experiencing considerable delay on our server connections. 
   Discovered that it was the server was doing an initgroups call for 
   each fork'd process.  As we use yp, and our group file keeps growing, 
   AND yp is single threaded, all of the accesses were getting queued
   up waiting for ypserv.
     
   We tweaked the code to allow us to only do the initgroups
   call once, and use that information the remaining times.  As the 
   uid/gid is always the same, this is sufficient.
     
FWIW, there's more in the way of speed increases where that came from, 
and some of them are fairly easy to arrange for.  On each connection, 
the NCSA server:
     
*) Talks to the nameserver --- yet another opportunity for YP to
   serialize you.  I'm not sure how to fix this *portably*, but 
   cacheing the hostnames of recently seen clients in shared memory 
   eases things somewhat.  Compiling with -DMINIMAL_DNS keeps the 
   server from talking to the nameserver at all, and is a simpler and 
   better option for those who can live with it.
     
*) Tries to open a whole lot of .htaccess files which aren't there.
   People running close to the edge can get around this by turning off 
   the .htaccess checks entirely with an AllowOverride None at the 
   right spot in access.conf.  This may be a substantial win for those 
   afflicted with AFS.  (The checks for symlinks at every directory 
   are also a potential source of overhead, though in that case, 
   things may be better simply because the directories in question
   actually exist, and so kernel machinery like the namei cache works).
     
There are a few more obvious speed improvements which are harder to 
arrange for (you have to change some of the server code), but the 
payoffs, at least for the first listed hack below, are substantial:
     
*) Reads the request and MIME header from the client character by
   character, taking a context-switch into and out of the kernel on 
   each.  This is a MAJOR performance hit, and easy to kludge around, 
   but you do have to change the server code.  It's only mildly hard 
   to fix right.
     
*) Opens the locale database to find out the names of the months, and
   opens some other file to find the time zone.  (Actually, the C 
   library does this behind httpd's back, but the effect is the same).
     
   I got rid of this overhead by doing a few dummy time conversions 
   before starting to listen on the socket --- this initializes the C 
   library time-conversion code in the parent process, and so the 
   children don't have to do it themselves after the fork().
     
I've fixed most of the above in the server I'm running (all except 
.htaccess files, which require some code cleanup to get right), and 
that gets you close to the end of the line --- much improvement beyond 
that will probably come only by eliminating the fork on every 
transaction.  (The overhead of fork() is difficult to measure directly, 
but it shows up indirectly in some of my other measurements, and it 
seems to be large).
     
That's only after some cleanups, though --- the standard NCSA server 
spends most of its time figuring out what groups "nobody" is in, over 
and over and over...
     
rst
     
PS --- your patch has a *very* minor bug --- if the server rereads the
       config files, it doesn't change the group info, even though 
       User might have changed in httpd.conf, and the appropriate 
       groups might have changed in any event.  This is never likely 
       to come up in practice, but I'm a little compulsive about these 
       things.
     
[1] If you really want to do this right, at least on SunOS, you can
    recv the header with MSG_PEEK instead of reading it, and then only 
    read those bytes out of the kernel buffers which actually contain 
    the header, leaving the rest for a CGI script.  This handles POST 
    right, as well as GET.  David Robinson came up with this idea and 
    has actually coded it up.  Or, you could do as the CERN server does 
    --- buffer the client socket as usual, and then pipe the contents 
    of the buffer to any script that wants to see them, but that's more 
    work starting from the existing NCSA code.

Hi,
   
   We are currently considering purchase and set up a secured
WWW server so we can pass sensitive documents back and forth.
My questions are

   a. "Are there secured servers, other then Netscape Commerce, out there?"

   b. "Has anyone done any comparison between these servers?"
       functionality? cost? encryption mechanism used? etc...

   Thanks in advance.

>Oh dear, it seems that mail has been lost :-(

Actually, it's all there; occupying some 36 megabytes on one
of my machines...  but I don't know if Arthur plans on
dumping it into the queue.  There are probably a lot of resends..

This had nothing to do with the PS incident.  "An Incident"
(can't say much) happened here a few weeks ago, after which we
had to reinstall the operating systems on our various WWW servers.
I got the main services going (http, telnet-access, ftp, etc.); 
the person doing the mail services (listproc, Agora) got Agora 
going here, but then went to MIT to properly install everything 
there.  So this list is actually being served from the US now.

(Oh, and the PS problem isn't as bad as initially feared -- maybe
only a couple weeks delay to startup, and maybe the physics program
won't be impacted at all!  Lotsa overtime being done..)

> I not sure which his worse-postal workers, or particle 
> physicists...

Particle physicists are wonderful, charming people.  The guy
who damaged the PS was a technician, I believe.

The www-talk list is gated at CERN to a "local" newsgroup, cern.www.talk,
which many other sites (including some big commercial ones) pick up.  
There've been some people using it as a regular newsgroup.

Regarding the restoration of service at MIT: I suspect www-talk was the 
second priority (after Agora), but the other lists will probably all be
served from the same machine by the same software, so I'd bet the others
will be back soon.  (www-announce might need a moderator, though.)  In 
any case, I'm sure Arthur will post a message when everything is going
perfectly.

It's true.  This is my last day!

Subject: Industry Standard HTTP Server Benchmark Based on SPEC SFS (LADDIS)

I have converted LADDIS (industry standard SPEC benchmark to measure
NFS performance) to an HTTP server benchmark. Currently it uses a very
elementary workload (one URL). The results of this benchmark are
included at the end of this message.

The advantages of this benchmark are:
- it is a multiclient benchmark
- the client side implementation does not influence benchmark results
  which is the way it should be for a server benchmark
The disadvantages of this benchmark are:
- the current workload is not realistic

I need help to:
- Review benchmark methodology/implementation
- Create a realistic workload (or maybe different workloads for
  different environments)

LADDIS was originally developed by six vendors who saw the need for
better NFS benchmarks (Legato, Auspex, DEC, Data General, Interphase,
and Sun).  The original work group then took the benchmark to SPEC for
further development and promotion as an industry standard.  LADDIS has
considerably helped performance evaluation of NFS servers, thereby
contributing to the development of better servers.

I want to make the same thing happen for HTTP servers.  It's important
that such work not be done by any single vendor, nor with any single
narrow viewpoint of the requirements.  Would people in this group be
interested in working together to create an industry standard benchmark
for HTTP servers?

I would like to thank the SMCC Performance Engineering Group for their
support in this effort.

Regards,
Prasad

Note: this table illustrates the type of output generated by this
benchmark.  The actual numbers aren't meaningful due to the dummy
workload and uncontrolled test environment.

I have been implementing a scheme interface to the 3.0 version of
libWWW library (for more informations on this, have a look at
http://www.inria.fr/koala/abaird/oscheme/oscheme.html), and hitted a
problem I don't know how to solve.

For the time being I have replaced the HTEvent.c module with my own
version of it, which is, as I understand, the recommended way of doing
it. However, I would now like to integrate both my scheme/Motif
extension and the scheme/WWW extension together. Hence I need to plug
libWWW events with the standard XtAppAddInput() stuff.

Looking at the code, the only way I can do this is to replace the
HTThread.c file, in order to rewrite the HTThreadState() function, and
make it call the Xt specific stuff. However, modules that are to be
replaced in libWWW are usually advertized as such, and this one is
not. So before doing it this way, I was wondering if someone here had
any experiences to share regarding this problem.

Thanks for your attention,

Anselm

[the original mail was lost during info.cern.ch downtime]
Hi,

i would like to profile my www server (or rather the CGI client),
and i'm looking around for a benchmark programs/robot which would
automate the process. Basicly, i'm looking around fore some software
which:

1. take a base URL
2. retrieves all URL in the base document, but
3. do not goes outside the server (e.g. restrict the set of
   allowed URL),
4. minimum time between HEADs/GETs,
5. runs under unix (preferable SunOS 4.1 - i have ported software
   to hp-ux/solaris 2.x/dec osf/4.3bsd/aix/ultrix/sgi/linux)

With all the HTTP severs around, I hope that some server author(s)
might have some (almost) ready-to-run software. I would write 
something quick and dirty, but i'm currently have some other priorities
(thesis writing). Of course, i will summarize to the list.

thank you,

msj

I have been unable to find any that are currently available, although a number
are in beta testing.

The main difference is whether they support shttp or SSL. SSL looks fine for
basic secured data transfer but doesn't support nonrepudiation which is kinda
handy if you are doing financial transactions.

Netscape do however promise to support shttp as soon as a reference
implementation becomes available.

Has anyone ever done a survey of:
 1. How the different WWW-browsers parse HTML?
 2. What "dialect" of HTML they handle?
 3. What SGML-features that make them choke (processing instructions,
    comments, prematurely ending tags in attributes)
 4. What HTTP header information according to the HTTP/1.0 draft they
    can make use of? ("Link:" navigation etc.)

I crawled around the www.w3.org web a little while ago, but I didn't
find anything matching.

   [the original mail was lost during info.cern.ch downtime]
   Hi,

   i would like to profile my www server (or rather the CGI client),
   and i'm looking around for a benchmark programs/robot which would
   automate the process. Basicly, i'm looking around fore some software
   which:

   1. take a base URL
   2. retrieves all URL in the base document, but
   3. do not goes outside the server (e.g. restrict the set of
      allowed URL),
   4. minimum time between HEADs/GETs,
   5. runs under unix (preferable SunOS 4.1 - i have ported software
      to hp-ux/solaris 2.x/dec osf/4.3bsd/aix/ultrix/sgi/linux)

I've written a logfile replay program which may be of some use to you
--- it was written on SunOS, and *ought* to be fairly portable (though
I understand that you've got to work a bit to find the right header
files on AIX).  The program takes a log in Common Log Format, and
replays the GET transactions at a user-specified rate.  (It's capable
of having multiple transactions open simultaneously, and in fact
that's the common case, up to a user-specified maximum --- NB if that
maximum exceeds the maximum number of file descriptors a single
process has open, the program will croak).

Every 100 transactions, the program reports the mean latency for those
100 transactions, and the cumulative mean latency.  (Things get a
little hairier if it can't initiate transactions because more than the
user-set maximum were in progress).

The program has some limitations --- it doesn't try to replay POSTs
(there isn't enough information logged to do it properly), and it
doesn't deal with HTTP authentication (so it's not useful at sites
which make heavy use of that feature).  However, some people at other
sites have gotten good service out of it.

If you want to look it over, see ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/rst/monkey.c

I missed the start of this, so I'm not sure what "Run on more than one
OS" means. We tried to sell our changes to NCSA X Mosaic to make it
run on the Amiga back to NCSA, but NCSA seemed to have political
problems attached to even admitting that it existed.

I think the results would have been like the linemode browser - it
builds from one source tree with conditional code and a couple of
OS-specific interface files, and runs on more than one OS.

This not quite Emacs-w3, where the results of a "make" can run on more
than one OS.

Hi:

I  would like to inquire whether any institutation, foundation, or organization
attached to this list would be interested and, in a position to sponsor a Web
Site repository for assistive technology information for people with
disabilities? I have received several requests for this repository and
several inquiries by organizations that might be in a position to help me fund
and host the effort. Right now, I'm looking at all the possibilities.

If I could afford it, I would certainly sponsor this myself. I am willing to
moderate and maintain the site. The purpose of the site would be to provide a 
total information repository for people with disabilities.

If you are interested, please send me e-mail at: paciello@shane.enet.dec.com

Thanks for your interest,

Regards,

for may be of interest.  I offer something called The HTML CyberClass -- a
"virtual class" on HTML and related topics taught over the Internet.  My
homepage both explains The HTML CyberClass and links to an outline which
provides the structure for the actual class.  While the class itself has 
a cost of $150 (and is conducted via a private email list), the outline 
is available as a service to anyone on the WWW interested in learning 
HTML.  The URL is http://www.halcyon.com/clearnts/welcome.html

Yours,

As everybody of us know, html is a "monodirectional" protocol -- in the sense
that the server cannot initiate a response by itself, but it has to wait
for a http request from the client.

(no, this is all wrong -- what I want to say is that with a HTML browser
you have to click to reload a page, otherwise it doesn't happen anything).

I (pronunciation: "my boss") would like to investigate how the thing could
be changed, in order to have a real "live" environment. Supposing for the
moment to stick with unix systems and reasonable root powers :-), the first 
ideas which came to me were the following:

(1) add a background process which polls every x seconds the server to check
    for a new (content of a) page
(2) try and integrate http server functionalities in the browser, to get 
    announcement of new data
(3) start a http client&server in the local machine and devise some way
    to communicate between the browser and the http daemon.

Now solution (1) is of course really simple to code, and it work fine for most 
applications, but it could generate unnecessary load, and besides I don't
like it very much. Solution (2) seems to mix two very different things at 
a logical level, and it should be avoided. Solution (3) in a certain sense
just moves the problem, since we have yet to think about how to make 
an interaction between the browser and the http daemon, but at least this
has become a "local" solution.

What do people think about it? All answers are welcome, from "HTML is not
the Right Means to do that, forget it" to "there is already such and such 
which makes what you propose". Just don't say "You are an idiot who is 
not even good to write in English", please - I do already know it, thanks.

ciao, .mau.

statistics are a great way to see who is, and how many people are
accessing your page -- this would be a great thing to promote to those

In a nutshell, here's what we've done to solve this.  By taking advantage of
the http_proxy protocol, we can insert little mini-servers in between the
browser and the real servers.  For the most part, these little mini-servers
(okay, call them agents if you really want) just pass the request/response
stream between the browser and servers.  However, they can also filter,
modify, and take external actions based on what they see in the stream.  In
addition we have a browser prototyping testbed into which we've
incorporated a communications channel that the agents can use to inform or
control the browser.

Take a look at http://riwww.osf.org:8001/www/waiba/index.html for more
info.   Also look at http://riwww.osf.org:8001/www/index.html for
information on other WWW projects at the OSF Research Institute.

Hi,
	I'm in the process of writing a book for PTR Prentice-Hall
tentatively entitled "Programming the World Wide Web: Protocols and
Implementation".  It's a book on how the Web actually works as opposed to
being another book on HTML or how to get on the Net.

	I need to find out what, if any, copyrights exist on the protocol
documents archived at W3C.  Specifically, I'm working the chapter on
HTTP/1.0 right now.  I realize that the spec is an "Internet draft" and
subject to change without notice.  During my examination of the protocol, I
need to copy certain descriptions almost word-for-word.  My "value-added"
will be lots of examples and development of a mini HTTP server in Perl
(with apologies to Plexus).  I'll also include some discussion of current
areas of active WWW research & development.  Of course, I'll mention how
all these wonderful open standards came into being through the selfless
efforts of several individuals as well as the vigorous participation of the
USENET community.

	Now, I certainly don't want to be accused of plagiarism or get my
tush dragged into court.  At the very beginning of the chapter, I give
extensive credit to TBL as well as explain a little bit about the process
of Internet drafts, RFCs, etc.

	Whom do I contact to find out what permissions I need?  And while
I'm asking, who hold the copyrights on RFCs?  Is it IETF?  The individual
authors?

	Thanks for any help you can offer.

pat

Check out some of the work we have done. Shared Mosaic is being built 
to create a peer-to-peer environment for "real-time" information access.
Some documentation is available at,
	http://www.eit.com/software/mosaic/shared-mosaic.html

Right now it is human driven on remote site, but the architecture is
not tied to this specific metaphor.

Is the project done ? No not yet !
Are we still working on this ? Yes ! and will be finishing real soon now
....:)

Enjoy,

Appologies if this is a question already discussed, or inappropriate
for this mail list.

I need to know how to setup web pages for customers, all hosted on the
same server.  I want each customer's URL to be free from the host-system's
server name.  For example, the server is www.medio.net.  I DON't want
customer's URL's to be:  http://www.medio.net/CustomerA
NOR do I want to put them on a seperate port, and run a second server
on that port.  Is there another way to do this that I'm missing.

For what it's worth, I'm using the Netscape Commerce Server.

Braga, whose foundation remounts to Celtic times, assumed a relevant paper
in Roman epoch, being the meeting point for five famous Roman roads. This 
city - with more than 2.250 years - is one of the most old Christian cities, 
and is known as "The Portuguese Rome" or "The City of the Archbishops".

Minho University with more than 12.000 students is composed by several 
departments and research centres, giving great contribution to development
of north region of the country. The Computer Science Department is, since 
the beginning, in the front-line of availability and utilization of network 
services in Portugal.

When I was experimenting at getting the HTML/Web more interactive/
proactive, here what I did to make it possible for a web page to become 
"active" on its own (not just purely responding to user's events).

*** Connected HTML with a scripting language (Viola script)

With that, you could do tons of stuff... I mean, you've basically got
the capability to program intelligence into your document.

So, for a dumb example, you could link a piece of script to your HTML 
which in effect causes the browser to update a document every N seconds.

Or, the script/agent/applet could open a connection to some kind of 
"change-notifycation" server, and upon detection of certain conditions,
the script sends a message to the browser telling it to go reload the 
document... etc etc etc.

And to make something like Internet Relay Chat on the Web, I wrote this
multi-threaded server (select() based, not OS level m.t.) which acts as a
very simple httpd and message relay.

So, it basically works this way: 

* start up ViolaWWW. 
* load a chat-applet document, via HTTP, say.
* the chat-applet gets interpreted and built by the viola interpreter.
* the chat-applet connects to the relay server (using its own very simple
  protocol), and off you go... you've got a two-way channel to communicate
  with other people also looking at the same chat-applet-page using ViolaWWW.

This demo lets you communicate with typed messages and simple picture
sketchings... well, see the paper for a screendump of the demo. 

	http://berkeley.ora.com/proj/viola/violaIntro.html

That paper's kinda out dated, but... it's there.

It's fully amazing how much wider the scope of things you could do if 
you had a scripting language in a browser. Even with a language of
very limited facilities (limited for security reasons).

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by two-way HTML. I can see situations
where it's much better to abstract away whatever we need into HTML, 
without the need for a scripting language. That'll probably happen once
we figure out and agree on what we want :)

But one of the points of going with the scripting language approach 
is that we don't know all what we're going to need, and a "programming" 
language gives you lots of flexibility to deal with new situations.

PS: The whole setup isn't polished enough for general release. So... But 
maybe before too long I'll get enough time and inclination to get it done :)

The recent discussion of "two-way communication over WWW" seems to be
related to an interactive problem I'm working on as well.  For discussion
and sharing purposes, I'm including a rough outline of my approach to it.

Basically, at least for my problem on hand, it is necessary to modify
both the browser to identify itself and to provide its private listening port,
and the server to "know" each browser's identity and private listening port
(like knowing friends' telephone numbers).  In other words, for an
interactive system, the server has to give some states to on-line browsers
while at the same time, not spend more network resources to servicing
browsers than what is required now (the "network-statelessness" ideal).

I've looked a bit at NCSA's recent Common Client Interface (CCI). 
On the face of it, it seems that it does not provide sufficient "binding"
between the browser and the server to meet the requirements of my
problem on hand.  But I could be wrong.
** Note: This is not to imply anything not good about it.  
         I just need a different communication model than
	 CCI's model.

I'm including the attachment below for any discussion or comments.  
It does not have complete details but should be sufficient to give an
outline of the approach.  Let me know your comments, suggestions,
criticisms, etc either through emailing to me (cheekai@ncb.gov.sg)
or discuss it over this list.  Flames will be happily absorbed to cook
my eggs :)

-------------------------- BEGIN OF INCLUSION ---------------------------
== The Problem ==
While braving the odds and plunging into writing a WWW-based
MUD-style interactive pager, I ran up the same difficulty due
to the "monodirectional" nature of HTTP protocol.
In an interactive system such as a MUD, the server may sporadically
send messages to the client-person who is in a particular room.


== The UID Scheme ==
After thinking through, it seems a solution is possible if the
browser used to connect to the HTTP-MUD server can also attach
a unique ID for all its HTTP requests.  This unique ID (UID)
is a combination of machine type (M), OS type (O), login username (L), 
timestamp (T) of first initiation of the browser (i.e. this
timestamp doesn't change in subsequent commands sent by this
instance of the browser), process ID (I), and browser's listening
port (P) --  MOLTIP. This "combination" may be a 1-1 function mapping
	(M,O,L,T,I,P) --> UID
or an N-to-1 function hash function with a small collision probability
(e.g. < 1%).  The implications of a collision means different
instances of browsers (and persons) may appear as the same to
the server side.  An example of a 1-1 function for this purpose
can be a concatenation of MOLTIP values casted to lower-case and
separated by hyphens '-':
	(M,O,L,T,I,P) -->  T-I-P-L-O-M
	Eg 19950305130255020-2452-4523-cheekai-sunos4.1.3-sun
The M,O,L fields are clear.  The timestamp is in yyyymmddhhmmssiii
format, with yyyy being year, mm being month, dd being date, hh
being hour, mm being minute, ss being second, iii being milisec,
and is in fixed length format so that it may be strcmp()ed to give
a meaningful relational comparison.  The I, and P fields should be
straightforward.

The client browser, on initiation, opens a listening port on any
available unused port in the system, but must use the same port
as long as this instance of the browser is alive.  It then
computes its UID, and attaches this UID as the first item on each
of its request to the HTTP-MUD server.  Eg,  "GET /index.html"
now becomes "UID  GET /index.html", where UID expands to the
MOLTIP UID value above.

On the server end, all incoming UIDs are cached and tagged with
the browser's host IP address and server's own timestamp.
This server timestamp serves as a Time-To-Live (TTL) check, so that
after a certain time, say 10 minutes, has elapsed and no fresh 
request bearing this UID is received, then the server may remove
this UID.  To an interactive system like HTTP-MUD, removing a
cached UID implies an action similar to
"Connection closed by foreign host."; in other words, the
interactive system no longer recognises the person/browser bearing
the UID as being "logged into" the interactive system.

To the server, an incoming request from any browser is serviced
as per normal.  If the attached UID is present, it is either cached
in the server if it hasn't been, or has its entry refreshed if 
the entry already exists.  An absence of UID should cause no error.

Whenever the interactive server wishes to initiate an unsolicited
document/message [*] to a browser whose UID is present in the server's
cache, the server will have all the relevant network information
to send its information to the specific instance of the browser.
The server uses a simple protocol (call this HTTP extension, or
Return-HTTP,  I don't know :) by first sending a line stating
the browser's UID and other protocol information [*], followed
by "\r\n" (CR+LF), and followed by server's intended HTML documents.



== What's The Big Idea? ==
This UID scheme basically exploits the ports on a client machine
to provide a sort of private "telephone line" to the user.
Current browsers function like telephones with only out-going
communication ability.  With the UID scheme, browsers using this
scheme will function like the usual telephones, with two-way
call initiation ability while not deviating too much from existing
HTTP servers;  servers which do not wish to implement MOLTIP UIDs
can simply test if the incoming request string begins with numeric
values (assuming the example 1-1 function above is used), and ignore
the first word if a numeric word begins the string.

A browser that does not implement MOLTIP-UID does not listen on
any port for the user and so need not worry about the R-HTTP 
protocol which the server uses to return replies to a MOLTIP-UID-
aware browser.  A browser which implements MOLTIP-UID listens on
its announced port to the server, and discards any message with
a different UID from its own UID.  This is similar to Ethernet's
protocol in which an Ethernet node is exposed to packets to every
node but would only admit packets targetted at that particular node.



== Potential Uses ==
It has almost an immediate use in interactive systems trying to
leverage on well-establishd standards like HTML and HTTP.  Interactive
browsing becomes possible when the server can asynchronously initiate
a conversation with a user.  This has a direct relevance in, for
instance, an advertisement/classifieds server whereby the availability
of new advertisements/products may be made known to the currently
connected browsers (which will be presumably servicing users interested
in related ads).  

MUD - Multi-User Domain - will be possible with MOLTIP UIDs.
New people who just stepped into person A's room can be made known
to A's browser which would otherwise not know who has entered the
room unless A continuously flushes its browser's cache and reloads
the same page over and over again, which is certainly a network-intensive
process.  

The use, as I work on this MOLTIP UID spec, seems to extend beyond
just games and interactivity.  In a remote and intensive document
search, for example, a HTTP-MOLTIP server can first return an
acknowledgement document saying the search has been initiated.
Since the server already has the browser's MOLTIP UID, it can 
close the connection to relieve the browser from being "hung"
while waiting for the server's long searching time.  The browser
may, in the mean time, surf through other documents, perhaps 
initiating searches on more servers.  When the first server
has reached a conclusion to its search (successful or otherwise),
it may package its result (eg, tag copyright/contact information,
compress long documents, etc) and initiate a server->client
reply message to the original browser via its cached MOLTIP UID.


[*] I didn't include the details on "R-HTTP" here to avoid
    making this an excessively long mail.

In this case, it is worth noting that browsers would want to have
message caching so that the incoming response doesn't destroy the
document you are currently viewing.  In other words, there would
have to be a cache mechanism on the client side for responses based
on MOLTIP UID's or something so that you could tell multiple messages
from different servers apart in the queue.

Maybe a window with a Netscape-hotlist style interface would work, but
it would be separate from the hotlist in implementation unless a link
to your list was specifically requested.

Anyway, something to consider.

Actually, it would help your argument quite a bit to give more details.

Hi,

Apologies if this one is too obvious :)

A beginner in me would like to know as to what all changes would be 
required to get this protocol running. Server? Client? Client, obviously! 
But i feel it's possible without any server change (maybe for most 
cases). The client would ask for an update every n seconds, and maybe 
check if the new data has a timestamp newer than the previous one.

Additionally, i would like some action to take place every time the user 
presses <cr> in a form field, or selects a different "radio" option.

Time has come to make http interactive! Say what?

It is possible to assign a different server address to each customer using=

CERN or NCSA http server (having actually only one machine and one=20
ethernet port).

Check out http://www.thesphere.com/~dlp/TwoServers/

I think you as a customer should ask Netscape when will they support this=
=20
feature in their server. Many customers want this possibility, and I=20
personally won't buy Netsite server before I can run many servers on one=20
machine with it.

This is not possible in the 1.0 release of the Netsite servers (it
missed being there by about a half a day). It is possible in the
upcoming 1.1 releases of the servers.

This seems to come up from time to time.  Also seems to die
fairly quickly.  I'm not sure what is being proposed in the
current thread.

1.  Interactive html?  Interacting with what? User?  Browser?
	Server?
2.  Maybe interactive browsers?  How so?  Modifying content of
	html stuff in the browser?
3.  "make http interactive"?  Hmm...  I'm busy reading a document
	when a (sic) server decides to interact with my browser.

Under current protocols browser developers are free to make their
products as interactive as they wish.  Netscape will interact with
the user while carrying on its communication activities in the 
background.  Interactions can certainly be extended but they will 
also have to be explained and understood.  Having a document that
I'm reading unexplicably change as I'm reading would be most
bothersome.  Raising a flag to say "I'm obsolete" might not be a
bother.  The problem's not http or html, it's the human interaction.

No,
the http protocol is not monodirectional.  It's use with browsers
like the Mosaic derivatives may exhibit a monodirectional behavior but
that is not the protocol.  We have http clients running in Excel and
Visual Basic that are certainly not monodirectional.  Browsers are only
one model for http clients, MUD clients could be another.

I'm worried that in the discussions on interactive HTTP people haven't
been sufficiently concerned with bandwidth or server load. I'm
currently researching wide-area WWW caching schemes (more than just
campus proxies or client caches) so I'm very attuned to issues that
might affect this. Querying the server every n seconds is not only
very inefficient, but even a mildly popular site would quickly become
overloaded. Likewise, in the rush to add dynamic pages to the WWW I
think we should not forget that caching information is one of the ways
we're going to make sure that WWW growth does not overtake Internat
capacity. Anytime you can handle interactivity by transferring a
script to the client and having the script run on the browser is going
to be a much better solution than always running the script on the
server, and forcing the client to act as nothing more than a fancy
dumb terminal. That way the script could be cached around the net, and
the original server's load will not depend on how interactive the
particular application is.

Can you modify your DNS records? By adding CNAME aliases you could 
customize the server name for each client. Just a thought...

Many of these concerns have already been aired on this list and it
might behoove some new members to go digging through the list archives
a bit to see what has already been explored.  However, the implementation
proposed is somewhat new and is fairly simple to implement.  I think
the critical point of Chin's suggestion is that it does not involve
polling the server every 'n' seconds for anything but rather initiates
a short-duration UID that is used for interaction between a client and
server using http.  If we look at it from that perspective, many initial
concerns that have been raised should be amply satisfied.

I would still welcome news of contributions in the area of WAN caching
as Mr. Gwertzman has already recognized how important such schemes will
be in the development of increasing WAN content.

I just downloaded my copy of Netscape 1.1 beta 1, very happy to see them
exploring with tables and other 3.0 features in a mostly standard way. 
However, I was very dismayed to see that the Accept: headers did *not*
include something indicating it was HTML 3.0-ready, like text/x-html3 or
text/html; version=3.0.  

Please

Please

<font size=7>PLEASE</font>

..if you are writing an HTML 3.0 browser, indicate that in your Accept: 
headers, so those of us with content-type-negotiating servers can dish 
out HTML 3.0 documents to HTML 3.0 clients and HTML 2.0 docs to HTML 2.0 
clients.  I can *not* underscore how important this is, especially when 
it's soooo easy to do.  Thank you.

One element of modern application programs that has so far pretty much been 
neglected in Web client development is the integrated scripting language.  I 
see at least 3 uses for a Web scripting language:

1) Building extensions for current browsers;

2) A secure substitute for other CGI scripting languages; and

3) Adding intelligent agent capabilities to the Web.

One possible base for this work would be Safe-Tcl, Nathaniel Borenstein's 
and Marshall Rose's email scripting extension for John Ousterhout's Tcl/Tk. 
 Safe-Tcl uses a two-level interpreter, where the outer interpreter supports 
a carefully limited set of high-level capabilities.  Safe-Tcl is designed 
such that:

a) Modifications to the user's system have to be approved by the user in a 
reasonably high-level fashion;

b) Email generated has to be approved by the user in, again, a reasonably 
high-level fashion; and

c) "Excessive" use of system resources also has to be user-approved.

An additional basic guideline for Web scripting would then be:

d) Modifications to the Web server's system (POST or PUT) would have to be 
approved by the user in a reasonably high-level fashion.

I think that (a)-(d) would suffice as constraints for (1) above (browser 
extensions).


A secure substitute for CGI scripting languages ((2) above) for gateway 
purposes might be handled via the current CERN server's ability to run CGI 
scripts under a separate user ID that has no directory/file write 
permissions anywhere except perhaps to a directory for temporary files.  If 
the gateways can be constructed as one-pass programs, then temporary files 
would not be needed by CGI scripts under OSes that support pipelining.


Intelligent Web agents would:

i) Be able to walk the Web on their own (travel from machine to machine);

ii) Via a specific URL at each host, like 
"http://your.machine.com/Agent-Entry";

iii) Interacting with a specified user ID (like 
"webmaster@your.machine.com") who would have the approval authority from 
constraints (a)-(d) above.

If the URL "http://your.machine.com/Agent-Entry" did not exist, no agent 
could enter that Web.  If agents are permitted entry, capability (iii) along 
with constraints (a)-(d) should enable each site to formulate an appropriate 
policy for agent execution.  "Spiders" could really walk the Web...


I suggest the name "Spider" for this Safe-Tcl extension.

I am currently experiencing two ways html through the use of scripts:
the general guideline is to try to make it *whithout* any changes in
the current available servers and browsers.

The idea - which seems quiet common now - is to have the server send
scripts to the browser, encoded as a special MIME type (in my case,
for example application/scheme). By using Mosaic 2.5 CCI capabilities,
this MIME type gets forwarded to a scheme interpreter that evaluates
the script. For those of you who understand lisp, here is an example
of what I call a "script-document":

----- foo.scm
;; Have fun:
;; This is to be launched in the "demo" context were we now that the mosaic
;; pilot is bound to *pilot* :-(

(define *urls* 
  '("http://www.inria.fr"
    "http://www.inria.fr/koala"
    "http://www.inria.fr/koala/abaird.html"
    "http://www.inria.fr/koala/abaird/oscheme/oscheme.html"))

(for-each (lambda (url) 
            (format (current-error-port) "Going to %0\n" url)
            [*pilot* goto: url] 
            (sleep 5))
          *urls*)
-----

When this scripts gets executed in the "helper" scheme interpreter, it
sends back requests to the Mosaic browsers (using the GOTO CCI
protocol request), and make it visit the given set of HTML pages
automagically.

This presents a number of advantages - as was mention by someone this
morning on the list - one of it being that it requires no changes in
currently available WWW components (well, as long as something like
Mosaic 2.5 CCI is agreed upon).

However, they are also disadvantages, the biggest one being
security. I'm currently working on a "secure" version of scheme, which
would allow to run "script-document" in a somehow "secure"
environment: the accessible primitive set is reduced depending on a
security level, and various parameters, such as file I/O and CPU
consumption can be limited.

I hope this helps the discussion, my point here is just to show that
scripting may really improve WWW interactivity, and it is not that far
now (given all the various efforts going in that direction).

Thanks for your attention,

Anselm.

Sorry about this... I tried to leave a forwarding pointer, but
I suppose the sysadmin deleted it with all my other stuff.

My new Welcome Page is at:

	http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/Connolly/

Not all the stuff I had at HaL is available there, as I need to
update some links and generally Q/A it before releasing it to the
world.

In the mean time, Roy Fielding maintains an excellent archive of
the HTML materials:

	"IETF - HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Working Group"
	ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/index.html
or
	http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/index.html

Also, keep an eye on the traditional HTML page:

	http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html

I hope to update that page this week sometime.

Not all that neglected. See
http://www.phone.net/~mwm/Mosaic-Rexx-Interface/manual.html for the
manual to one such interface.

> 1) Building extensions for current browsers;

Yup; this is the thing that's been most exploited. The hotlist and
print interfaces have been replaced by invocation of scripts. I have
scripts to interact with other HTML display mechanisms, add entries to
pages, interact with editors, etc. Other people have scripts to post
news: followups, and there's probably things happening that nobody
involved thought of.

> 2) A secure substitute for other CGI scripting languages; and

We haven't done much of that; the faciities that would allow servers
to invoke scripts weren't put in place.

> 3) Adding intelligent agent capabilities to the Web.

We've talked a bit about this. For a lot of the things suggested, the
scripts don't belong in a the browser, as you don't really need - or
even want - a GUI active while this is going on. Libraries to provide
high-level WWW facilities to other languages provide the same
functionality, without having to start a fairly large application to
get to them.

> Intelligent Web agents would:
>

Robots or spiders, which have already been written using library
facilities as discussed above.

Why not use the existing protocols for robots?

That name is already in use as an alias for web-wondering robots.

Hi All,

I apologise in advance for something which is not strictly relevant.

I see that mine was not the only vacation message which recently went to
this list - sorry...

However, for all those people who wrote to point out the deficencies in
my vacation program, (and some who were a little more 'direct'), I should 
point out that the message it responded to did _not_ have either a Sender 
or Precedence field nor even did the string '-request' appear in the 
headers anywhere. I dont know how it managed to slip through the
listprocessor at w3.org.

..so stop sending me messages please.

John

(We've been doing some things like this in network management rather than WWW,
and we're using Scheme and other compact languages rather than TCL.)

I think it's important to make a very clear distinction between
scripts which are to run in (or alongside) the user's browser or in
the user's computer from those scripts which are to run in servers.
The security and resource consumption concerns are different.

What we had (have) trouble with is this: Management of the scripts
that we've launched to servers.  The trouble is that they can migrate
away or that we (or our machines) somehow forget about their
existance.  Sometimes we want to kill-off a worm that did unexpected
bad things.  Overall, it seems a bad idea to have the ability to
launch a potentially infinite-lived worm out onto the net. (Now, where
*did* I put my copy of Shockwave Rider?)

Comparing the consequences between a almost-HTML-3.0 browser viewing 
HTML 3.0 pages and a not-more-than-HTML-2.0 browser viewing HTML 3.0 pages, 
I think the former case is much preferable, particularly if it helps 
encourage the almost-HTML-3.0 browser become fully-HTML-3.0.

One simple and powerful application for a scripting language interface
in the web is to have the notion of `expires' be an expression that is
evaluated in some safe language. That is: at what point should this
client contact that server in order to update the information
contained therein?

The `expires' expression should be evaluatable in terms of time,
location of client, or a variety of `shared variables', which might
require client-side participation in a state variable maintenance
system, but would generalize the web protocols in an interesting and
safe way.

(The work on Mobisaic at last year's Web conference used this idea,
and I found it attractive.)

That's a matter of taste, but when I point Netscape 1.1 at the W3O's
HTML3 tour (http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Arena/tour/start) I do see
real problems.

One fairly serious bug that shows up immediately is that the
inline images in <fig>s don't show up, leaving the caption text
floating well out of context:

  As you can see, HTML 3.0 supports text flow around floating figures.
  Other major additions include fill-out forms, tables and mathematical
  equations, and features for greater control of layout. A pause after
  a hard spell of fishing    ) Time-Life 1987

This problem is, in a sense, worse than the difficulties with tables
--- when a table-impaired browser tries to deal with a table-laden
page, you can at least see that there's stuff there which is being
handled improperly.  If a page uses <fig> and the browser doesn't know
about it, it may not be immediately obvious what's going wrong.

(One way around this would be to just not use <fig> until you can have
some confidence that a browser that claims to accept HTML/3.0 really
means it --- but that could delay the adoption of <fig> in cases where
it might actually be useful).

Another, lesser problem is that authors will expect the graphics
associated with a <note role="blah"> ... </note> to provide context
for the enclosed text.  So, when pages using those tags show up in a
browser that doesn't understand them, that text is likely to be a
little hard to read.

Also, <math> shows up as a garbled version of the source, which is
sometimes decipherable and sometimes not (when an unrecognized <over>
tag has vanished, the structural information about the formula that it
conveys is irretrievably gone along with it).

If the only way to fix the table problems is to break all these other
things, that still might be the right thing to do, but collectively, I
do think they add up to a headache which we should avoid if there's an
easy way to avoid it.  Putting tables into HTML/2.1 or 2.2 and doing
type arbitration based on those version numbers would avoid it.

X-Comment: To sign off, send mail to listproc@mail.w3.org with body DEL WWW-TALK

I'd like to clarify (or try to do it) some of the comments given
earlier.

I'd consider HTTP a "monodirectional" in the sense that only the
browser (client) may initiate a communication to the server;  the
server cannot initiate a transmission to a specific browser until
that browser opens a TCP connection to the server.  HTTP specs
states clearly that it is a request-response protocol;  a protocol
to transmit a request sent by the browser and to return a response 
generated by the server, within one TCP session (ie. prior to the
connected socket being closed by either party).  While TCP is
a full duplex channel, the fact that only the server and not the
browser provides a listening port means that no one can ever 
initiate a connection to a browser.  So without making the browser
install a listening port, it's hard to expect a browser to receive
unsolicited information.

On the "interactivity" issue, it is not HTML that needs to be 
interactive, but more on the system that comprises the HTTP server,
the browser and the network.  Interactivity, as I see it from the
perspective of my problem on hand, allows a person to initiate a
talk to another person via the server.  Since a person runs a client
(browser) to talk to a server which will in turn initiate a 
channel to another person's client browser, it is inherent in this
set up that mechanisms are needed to identify any specific instance
of browser, and for the browser to have the ability to "receive"
incoming calls via the provision of a browser's listening port.

On the comment about "I'm busy reading a document when a server
decides to interact with my browser",  I prefer to look at the
issues separately.  That a browser equipped with a listening socket
and so may be sent with unsolicited data does not imply that the
browser cannot decide how best it may present the data to the user.
It may prompt the user, or allow the user to turn off the line,
just like you may pull your phone off the wall to stop annoying
calls.  But the presence of an underlying mechanism that allows
incoming calls to the browser is important to interactive applications.

On the CCI issue, the web page on CCI seems to be uncertain about
how a browser should select its port for applications to communicate with
it.  The service offered by the browser in this case is also slightly
different.  The applications manipulate the browser and makes use 
of its HTML rendering capability and HTTP retrieval capability to
perform additional services.  This is unlike allowing a remote
server from sending in unsolicited information to the browser
(A user would not want his/her browser to be manipulated by an
external server without control).  Also, if a browser or CCI-application
uses a fixed port, no other browser may run with CCI capability.
Scripts and CCI-based services address a different requirement,
which is to provide "value-added" or intelligent processing and
making use of browser's display, URL and HTTP-aware capabilities
to achieve those services.  It still does not allow a server to
inform a particular browser its intended messages.

On Netscape's PullPush mechanism, the server basically holds on to
the TCP channel which a connecting browser has established in
expectation of more data to be sent to the browser.  The channel
is held open as long as the server thinks there is more data that
it may soon send, regardless of whether there is anything to be
sent through the channel at the moment.  Once again, it is not
"interactive" in that the server may not initiate a communication
to the browser once it allows that channel to be closed.  It is
an attempt, I'd consider, to do-away with the "interactivity" 
issue by exploiting TCP's duplex channel.

The ability for a browser to be interactive does not also imply
that the browser should be conference-capable.  Using the example I 
gave in the previous mail, a long server search may first acknowledge
the browser's request with a short document, and subsequently,
when the search is concluded, initiation transfer of the results
to the browser.  This is not conferencing, but interactivity.

It is a phenonmenon for WWW to have come this far.  Interactive
browsers need not always be involved in interactive transactions;
it may disable its incoming port to behave like the current
browsers.  But if browsers can listen, it will mean that information
can seek users instead of making users seek information.  

As usual, this is purely discussion on the points made and no personal
feelings should be attached.  Please share if you have a different
opinion so others, myself included, may also benefit from learning.
Afterall, that's why we're all here  :)

Wedging this into HTTP seems like a bad idea. HTTP is an
information retrieval protocol. For conferencing, look at
protocols like IRC[1] or the MUD stuff. Maybe even mbone channels.

I think within 6 months to two years, you'll see URLs
like:

Just like you see telnet:... URLs today.

Hi,
	Would someone know on how to distinguish between two submit buttons 
in the same form. In my application, one of them is for "Browse", while 
the other one is for "Submit". the CGI script has to take different 
actions for the two. Can't put browse in a separate form as both buttons 
need some common fields.

Thanxall

A good example of how to do this can be seen at:
http://bigmouth.pathfinder.com/time/daily/time/1995/latest.html

i.e., use multiple <form> </form> tags.

Don't pay anything -- take a look at glimpse.  It's availabe at
ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/glimpse.  If you want to take a look at it at
work, try http://infonet.welch.jhu.edu/system_search.html  or take a
look at Harvest (sorry, I have no idea what the URL is).

I would set up "Browse" and "Submit" as two radio items and give the submit
button a more generic label like "Do It" or "Ok".

..

Another base worth looking at, if only for comparative purposes, would
be General Magic's Telescript.  I haven't been able to find any
technical descriptions of Telescript, but it appears to have been
written with just this sort of problem in mind and (if its backers have
their way) may before too long have an installed platform base of a few
million users.  If it catches on, some sort of WWW-Telescript
interoperability will be very desirable.  (Pointers to more information
on Telescript would be appreciated.  The best reference I've found to
date is Wired 2.04 p. 102.)

However, the assumption that it is possible to create a safe
interpreted environment for intelligent agents troubles me.  The issue
is not just one of prohibiting agents from making arbitrary system
calls.  Isn't it the case that any non-trivial application requires
access to data which are in some way sensitive, and that sensitive data
by definition would be vulnerable to misuse by a malicious agent?
(This is most obvious in the case of agents with write access, but
potentially true even if agents have only read access.)  My point is
that if my data are sensitive, I will want to retain control of the
*algorithms* used to access them.  Or am I missing something?

Current browsers (e.g. Netscape Navigator) should be able to
handle multiple submit buttons:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Multiple submits</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-bin/env">

<INPUT NAME="SUBMIT" TYPE="submit" VALUE="Submit">
<INPUT TYPE="reset" VALUE="Reset">

will send SUBMIT=Browse or SUBMIT=Submit

There's nothing like revealing my ignorance to make information pop out
of the woodwork!  The sixth general WWW index I tried, Lycos, finally had
a few hits in a search for "Telescript".   Here are the most illuminating:

	CJ Silverio's informal General Magic page
	http://www.spies.com/ceej/magic.html

	The official General Magic corporate home page
	http://www.genmagic.com/

	Pointers to technical info on Telescript (some only on paper)
	http://minsky.med.Virginia.EDU:80/sdm7g/Projects/Python/TeleScript/

	Article on intelligent agents from The Economist (14May94 pp 87-88)
	http://phenom.physics.wisc.edu/~shalizi/Economist_Articles/agents.html

The General Magic home page includes references to two mailing lists,
MAGICCAP for users and MAGICDEV for developers.

Hi,
	Would someone know on how to distinguish between
two submit buttons 
in the same form. In my application, one of them is for
"Browse", while 
the other one is for "Submit". the CGI script has to take
different 
actions for the two. Can't put browse in a separate form as
both buttons 
need some common fields.

Thanxall
Rupesh
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Use separate values in your submit button definitions, such
as:
<p><INPUT NAME="SUBMIT" TYPE="submit"
VALUE="browse"> </p>
<p><INPUT NAME="SUBMIT" TYPE="submit"
VALUE="submit"> </p>

Have your script search for the value of SUBMIT.  If it
=browse execute the appropriate script or portion of the
script.  If SUBMIT=submit, then execute the submit script or
portion of code.  

Theoretically this should work, but I have not tried it, so I can
not validate it.

 Apparently there is an ISO standard dealing with hypermedia (13522), which
 I was unaware of until it was recently submitted to ITU SG8 (as a draft rec
 for T.171).

 Briefly, the standard describes a syntax for coding "multimedia and
 hypermedia" objects. The syntax is either ASN.1 or an SGML DTD (which are
 supposed to be isomorphic for this purpose), and the encoding is either BER
 or SDIF respectively (where SDIF is the ISO SGML Interchange format, which
 I am not familiar with). The standard also supports realtime objects, and
 is targeted towards TV oriented navigation, information kiosks, home
 shopping, games etc.

 Has anyone in www-land studied this document in the context of the Web? Is
 anyone aware of conforming applications? Does anyone have a URL for HyperODA
 (the ODA extensions for hypermedia) and SMSL (the ISO hypermedia oriented
 scripting language)?

 Thanks,
  Yuval

Use different name attributes for the two submit buttons:

<input type=submit name="browse" value="Browse...">
<input type=submit name="submit" value="Submit form">

You will get the name=value pair for a named submit button, so you can tell 
which one was pressed.

For what it is worth...
I have not seen any XMosaic browser send the SUBMIT value in the name/value
pairs. I just tested a couple different versions. I believe there were both
different versions of "NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System".

It's funny how suddenly a number of people seem to be thinking about
the same thing. After the recent messages on interactive documents &
client-side scripts here and even on the HTML-wg list, it seems proper
that I post my thoughts on the subject that I've jotted down over the
past few weeks.

	   -----------------------------------------------
		    "HyperText Scripting Language"

The recent discussions of client-side image maps, extensions to the
ISMAP-capability, client-side highlighting, etc. suggest that the time
is slowly getting ripe for client-side scripting. By that I mean a
bold leap away from all those half-hearted HTML extensions into a
completely new language.

In the past we have had discussions about all kinds of `safe' variants
of languages such as Scheme, Tcl, Python, and C. Those discussions
were probably premature and I'm not even sure that we know enough
about the Web now to do better, but still, another round of
discussions cannot hurt.

So, to stimulate some thought, here are my ideas, in random order, and
untested.

1. Let's be ambitious: take the best features of existing browsers,
CGI scripts, and stand-alone multi-media products and extrapolate as
far as you can. Then ask: what language do we need to send all this
over the wire plus:

  - animated algorithms with user settable parameters

  - text that slips away when you try to click on it

  - thumbnail HTML pages that circle each other on the screen

  - a complete browser for images in YAIF format

  - an update for your browser's HTML editor that auto-installs

  - a news-flash that updates itself every 5 minutes

  - a ticking clock that displays the users's local time

  - a `screen saver' for your browser's window

  - a script to get a page from somewhere & add highlighting

2. Obviously, the language must be `safe' (to the level chosen by the
user), but it should also be distributable in both source and binary
form. That is, we standardize on a `Uniform Object Code' (or bytecode,
or p-code, or...) and define a high-level language along with it.
Binary distribution should provide some form of protection against
plagiarism. Emulator technology has matured enough to make a UOC
interpreter feasible, with negligible loss of speed.

3. Make it (i.e., the suggested high-level language) a language that
*really* supports reusable code, through much restricted OOP: instance
variables are never exported, not even to subclasses; memory
management is automatic, through garbage collection; type checking
cannot be evaded, not even the run-time checking can be disabled.

4. Define an API consisting of the services that a program in this
language can expect to be present in its environment. This includes
such things as getting a document by URL, managing windows, displaying
a document in format X, etc. This could be in the form of a set of
classes, from which a program is created by subclassing.

5. Apart from a small kernel, you could even write the browser itself
in this language.

6. The language would solve the problems mentioned in the first
paragraph:

  - client-side image maps: the SRC-attribute of the IMG tag doesn't
    refer to an image, but to a script that, in turn, retrieves the
    image, displays it in its allocated sub-window and processes the
    user's mouse clicks.

  - multi-click imagemaps: ditto

  - client-side highlighting: current index servers generate a page of
    HTML with the search results, usully in the form of hyperlinks to
    the requested documents. New servers would generate a script
    instead, that included not only the list of URLs, but also the
    logic to modify a document after the user has retrieved it.

7. Difficult question: when a document is static, pressing the `Back'
button is unambiguous: you go back to exactly the same document that
you saw earlier. But if that document is dynamic, do you go back to
the state you left it in, to its start state, or does the `document'
continue to evolve even while you don't look at it? The examples above
of the news flash and the clock seem to suggest that the document
continues to evolve. But what if you go back to a document that has
long been removed from the browser's memory?

On the other hand, maybe this isn't such a difficult question after
all. In my browser I've made a distinction between short-term and
long-term memory: a certain number of pages is still there, though
hidden by newer ones. They have left a visual trace and when that
trace disappears you know that the page has fallen off the edge and
has to be reloaded if you want to go back to it. As long as that trace
is there, you don't go `back', you just bring it to the front.

8. One of the examples above already mentioned it: when you want to
distribute your data in some non-standard form, you can now do so:
just ship the reader along with the document. Its like those
self-extracting archives, which you can use even if you don't have
zip, arc, zoo, etc.

9. So far, I've talked about applications where the purpose of the
script was to interact with the user. Maybe the language can be used
to implement those much-hyped `agents' as well. Maybe you can collect
some scripts that you can send off to a server to run under its wings
for a while, negotiating and processing information before contacting
its home base again and passing on what it learned. Once you have a
program with good algorithms for deciding what information is useful
and what not, you can send the program instead of typing in a complex
boolean query.

10. The culture of the printed document has forced on us the use of
2-dimensional, static logos on letterheads, home pages, even in the
corners of television screens. Why not create moving logos?  A logo in
the corner of your HTML document that exhibits recognizable behaviour
instead of having a recognizable form.

What is the title of this ISO standard? It sounds like it could be MHEG

Heard of it, not used it. If you are interested in the interaction between
ISO-standards and The Real World &trade; I suppose you have looked into PREMO?

      I've found multiple submit buttons to be very useful for a number
      of applications where the fact that not every browser implements
      them is not critical - for example, I used them to sequence slides
      for my DCI/WebWorld presentations [much easier than using hyperlinks,
      there's just a list of slides, which is very easy to manage..].

      I'm also using them to create a menu, at the bottom of the page 
      accessed via my sig.url; again, this technique makes it Real Easy
      to manage a menu, and avoids image downloading, etc... However, I
      fear it won't work for all browsers (in this case there are other
      ways to reach those links..). I'd be very interested in getting some
      feedback about which browsers it doesn't work for, and v.v.

      If there's sufficient interest I'll publish the Perl code for those
      two applications, here or at the WDVL.

I've started some Hypernews pages on the issue of making the Web safe  
for interactivity -- as a place to collect and organize some of the  
diverse and insightful ideas being tossed about in this discussion.

I hope the active discussion will remain on these mailing lists;   
this works well with Hypernews since it lets you annotate the  
articles with pointers to (e.g.) your archived email messages.

Let me know if this is a useful service.  The current URL is:

<URL:http://www.geom.umn.edu/hypernews/get/interactive/index.html>


Here's the first page, in text form:

You can add contribute to these  HyperNews  documents. References to  
relevant articles in the  HTML-WG  or  WWW-Talk  archives are  
especially encouraged.

The first phase of this discussion is about the design requirements  
for various types of interactivity. The focus is on clarifying the  
needs of applications, with minimal prejudice as to implementation.  
Experimental implementations are nevertheless essential for revealing  
additional design considerations. Each topic or subtopic contains: 


* General reasons why this should be a design requirement. 

* General reasons why this should NOT be a design requirement. 

* Applications which are claimed to require this feature. 

* Proposed or experimental solutions. 

* Subsidiary issues to be resolved.

The classification and description of requirements will evolve as the  
discussion proceeds. 



Phase I: Evaluation of Design Requirements.

(Is this list complete? usefully categorized?) 


* Client-side scripting.  

	* Framework orthogonal to document format. 

	* Framework orthogonal to scripting language. 


* Client-side binary extensions ("components").  


* Server-to-client callbacks.  


* Session protocols (client-server or peer-to-peer).  


* Complete range of GUI events.  

	* Use existing standard for event records. 

	* Prepackaged rubber-banding. 


* Complete GUI layout control.

If I had my choice of languages to use for remote execution I would pick TURING.
TURING is a full and simple to use programming language that has a number of 
features would make it ideally suited to use as an agent scripting language.
1) Turing has a formal and provable semantics(this includes IO) and
   claims to meet the US DOD criteria as a TRUSTED language.
2) both compilers and interpreters exist for Turing.
3) Turing supports `faithful execution`; this means that either a program is
   executed according to the language semantics or else it is halted with a
   message describing the nature of the failure.

I would argue that the agent is not as important as who's agent is it.
If you give a person access to your system then what is wrong with giving
their agent the same access. In this way all of the standard security rules
that apply to normal users should apply to their agents. The main issue that
I can see is that a reliable way to verify who this agent belongs to, needs to
be developed. A second issue would be insuring that the language/protocol 
that is used by agents is reliable and verifiable.

What ever ends up becoming a standard for allowing agent execution it should
be reliable and stringently checked. If the current trend in software
development is used then the internet worm and other virus incidents will pale
in comparison to what will happen.

Hmmm... I haven't checked into it officially, but I think you can
safely proceed as if it all has the MIT X11 copyright statement,
i.e. as long as you don't claim ownership, you can do anything
you want with it.

As long as you cite your source and make a good faith effort to use
the most up-to-date material on the web, I think this is fine.

If you want to be certain, check with a lawyer. In fact, have Prentice
Hall's lawyer check into it. But I think you're pretty darned safe.

Hmmm... somebody at the IETF, and somebody at W3C -- probably timbl@w3.org.
I don't know whom to contact at IETF. Their web server is at:

Good question. I think the authors, though RFCs always say
"distribution of this memo is unlimited."

Good point.  Although I would like to be able to provide many classes
of services to people (or their agents) to whom I would never grant,
say, a Unix shell account.

A separate issue, but one we should consider as well, is that an
"intelligent" agent might be unintelligent enough to make certain
mistakes that a human would never make.  I'm thinking of things like
getting into an infinite loop and issuing the same query a million
times (poorly programmed WWW robots are a current example of this).
The kinds of software pathology they've been worrying about for years
in the RISKS Digest all apply to intelligent agents, and both the
designers of agents and the designers of services that agents interact
with need to be aware of them.  For this reason, it might be that I
would be willing to grant a human more access than I would grant his or
her robotic agent.

That is part of a collection of material about agentware and component-ware
( OpenDoc, SOM, OSA, ILU, CORBA, ... ) that are included as part of my
notes on a restricted/safe execution environment for Python which we 
diiscussed at the Python Workshop at NIST last November. 

<http://minsky.med.Virginia.EDU:80/sdm7g/Projects/Python/SafePython.html> 

( Some of the necessary hooks are implemented in the currently testing
beta version of Python. ) 


I haven't had time to update or reorganize the info on that page lately
( there's a lot of stuff just dumped into the /Misc subdirectory! ), so
I'll post the latest batch here: 

[ And I'll reserve my comments on some particular proposals and problems 
  for a later post. ] 



There is a software agents mailing list that has been somewhat
inactive while being moved from a Lookheed Listserv to one at
Sun, but from its charter, it would seem the appropriate place 
to discuss agent programming languages (TeleScript, safe-tcl,
etc. ) and protocols and compare implementation tricks. 

 Subscription address: <listserv@sunlabs.sun.com>

With a home page and archives at:

<http://www.smli.com/research/tcl/lists/agents-list.html>



There is a lot of links and papers on Intelligent Agents at:

Ralph Becket's page on Intelligent Software Agents: 
	<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rwab1/agents.html>

Tim Finin's page on Software Agents:
	<http://www.cs.umbc.edu/agents> 

Andy Wood's page of Software Agents:
	<http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~amw/agents>


The AI world uses "agents" for a number of different things including
programs like Coach or MicroSoft's BOB - which I wouldn't consider
"agents" in the strict sense, but much of the research IS relevant - 
especially in the area of how agents can interact and share information
with each other.

Hang on, surely this completely undercuts the whole idea of agents?  I think it
would be very sad if "my" agents could only run on machines where I have an
account!

I entirely agree - as a system administrator myself, I would not enable a
hypothetical "agent-receiver" service on any machine I adminstrate UNLESS I
was entirely sure that no agents could do harm, or deny services, to my
machines and users.

As a solution both to infinite loops (specifically) and the more general
cooperative nature of agents executing on other people's host machines, may
I suggest that agents should not be allowed to run indefinitely.  CPU usage
of a host by agents would be a resource should be controlled.

So, how about the host donating only a certain maximum run time to an
individual agent, and running no more than a certain number of agents at once?
ie. The host could forcibly cease interpreting/running the agent after a given
run time has elapsed.  When an agent arrives on a host, it could effectively
negotiate its time limit with its new host.  For example, the agent might
declare that it wants to run for up to 10 minutes, whereas the host might only
be prepared to let it run for 1 minute.  The host obviously must have the last
word (since this is cooperative processing on other people's machines), and
could then inform the agent that 1 minute is all it's getting.  This could be
used by the script to change how "deeply" it searches, perhaps..

If you anonymous FTP to a system and you are allowed access then at that
point you are a user. what about loggin into a system as GUEST?. Why not
allow "user" login and access based on other criteria then the fact that
an administrator has created a login and password for you. Why not use the 
net ID of the person logging in. That way a system could limit access based
on user information provided at login. Various levels of access could be
proviede based on the ability to validate the users origin.

Yes. Yes. Yes. All we need is more accounting and control information
associated with files. Allong with ACL's and ICL's.

I agree. One of the problems with UNIX as it exists is that there is little
reasonable control over access to data and programs. I would like to see
a system that supports both Access Control Lists and Integrity Control Lists.
Systems should also include a set of tools to manage and monitor the security
of a system. Currently I know of no tools that can effectively manage systems
in a way that the tools can be used by someone with less than a "GURU" standing.

You may be able to make a system idiot proof but it can never be made fool
proof. Because fools are so ingenious;)

It should be possible handle resource allocation and monitoring on a level
that has a finer grain then the "user". For example why not limit the number
of CPU cycles that can be spent running a program on an individual program
basis, or why not continue that to be able to limit resource usage based on
the data file being accessed.

User,Group,Others along with Read,Write,Execute is not near enough control 
to be able to allow people reasonable access to systems in a secure and
managed way. 
I would like to see a scheme similar to OS/2's Extended Attributes where a
system can store arbitrary information associated with a file. EA's in OS/2
are not the answer as they stand now, but they are a good idea. 

<rant mode on>
At some point in the future it may be that we will have operating systems that
are capable of supporting the kind of features necessary to support agents
and use by the public in general. But to get there we will have to abandon
the current 20 year old software design philosophy.
When UNIX was first developed operating systems of the day were written in 
assembler. 20 years later C has replaced assemble, and for C++ just think
of a macro assembler. With the newer languages and tools available why are
we now using the 90's moral equivalent of assembler?

As some know, we're being rather aggressive at Verity in developing Web
products that use our search and retrieval engine, the Topic Developer
Kernel (or Kit, if you prefer).  We've joined the W3C created various
relationships with browser and server companies and we're close to
releasing the 1.0 version of the Web search server that we've been showing
(and shipping in pre-release) for a few months.  I say all of this because
I've been a bit invisible lately as far as these lists are concerned.  Of
course, the lists themselves were invisible for a while...

A couple of times lately, I've brought up the notion that clients should
handle highlights (the terms that match a search query) better.  It's
rather inefficient to force the search server to proxy documents just so
that it can add highlights.  Worse, it takes the decision about *how* to
highlight (bold?  underline?  surround with asterisks?) out of the user's
hands (barring some sort of ugly protocol for telling the server).

We'd like to suggest a very simple approach -- a highlight tag.  This way,
our server could add the highlight tag in the appropriate places, but it
would be up to the browser (under the user's control, presumably) to decide
how to identify highlights in the text (turn them red, underline,
whatever).  An appropriate UI enhancement would be the addition of a "next
highlight" button or menu item and optionally a "previous highlight"
button.

However this is done, it should have an eye toward eventually allowing a
client to receive a URL and highlight information from the search server,
so that, armed with those two smidgens of data, it can fetch the document
and add the highlights all by itself.

I'd like to hear (1) suggestions on the form of this tag (we're assuming
something terribly simple such as <hl> and </hl>) and (2) objections or
concerns.

I'm cross-posting to www-talk and www-html;let's keep the markup-specific
discussion (which may be all of it) on -html.

Nick says...

   A couple of times lately, I've brought up the notion that clients should
   handle highlights (the terms that match a search query) better.  It's
   rather inefficient to force the search server to proxy documents just so
   that it can add highlights.  Worse, it takes the decision about *how* to
   highlight (bold?  underline?  surround with asterisks?) out of the user's
   hands (barring some sort of ugly protocol for telling the server).

   We'd like to suggest a very simple approach -- a highlight tag.  This way,
   our server could add the highlight tag in the appropriate places, but it
   would be up to the browser (under the user's control, presumably) to decide
   how to identify highlights in the text (turn them red, underline,
   whatever).  An appropriate UI enhancement would be the addition of a "next
   highlight" button or menu item and optionally a "previous highlight"
   button.

I agree with Nick that clients should be able to highlight search
results, but I suggest a simpler approach - when a server sends a
response to a search (and only the server *really* knows when this
is), it should send a keyword attribute in the HTML header, containing
the terms it thinks are relevant to the results (which may not be all
the terms specified.) Then the browser can (or not) implement a simple
way to find and highlight the terms.  Most (all?) browsers can already
search on text, so this is a very simple extension for them. It
relieves the server of having to muck with the actual HTML text it
sends, and uses existing mechanisms.

Cheers!

Excerpts from mail: 9-Mar-95 agents [was: Client-Side Sc.. "Steven D.
Majewski"@vir (10767)

I think this is not quite an accurate representation of my position,
actually.  I've argued for a procedural language (safe-tcl or something
better, if it comes along) because I want people to be able to do the
maximal possible number of things safely.  It isn't that I'm not sure
what *I* want to do, it's that I am absolutely sure that nobody knows
what *everybody* will want to do.  For that reason, my focus has been on
providing the maximum amount of expressive power that is compatible with
a safe language for untrusted scripts.

To make this crystal clear:  For any KNOWN application, you can probably
define an appropriate data type to "do it right" without a safe
language.  What a safe language provides you with is infrastructure for
future, UNKNOWN applications.  

A good example of this would be event scheduling.  If there were a
safe-tcl-like infrastructure widely available, you could use it to
experiment with the evolutionary development of a good distributed
system for scheduling meetings and the like.  However, once you had
fully elaborated such a system, and understood exactly what your users
needed and wanted from it, you could design a new MIME type
(application/meeting-scheduler) that would probably permit a system that
was in many ways richer and safer than the one based on the safe
language.  (This is analogous to the way SMTP and email evolved out of
FTP, actually.  You can still do most email-like things by FTP, it just
isn't the best way.)

In short, a safe language infrastructure is primarily a tool for the
cutting edge, to streamline and speed up the refinement and development
of new services.  I predict that many of the most successful
applications of such languages will lead directly to new data types that
permit the applications to be implemented WITHOUT the safe language,
because there's probably always going to be more expressive power
available that way.  But the overhead of installing support for such
things in a zillion different systems is very high.  A safe language
will permit a lot of services to be developed and played with in
*advance* of such domain-specific code installation.  

Of course, you still need to get the safe language installed everywhere,
e.g. in all the web browsers.  But once you do that, you can experiment
with advanced services much more easily, and thus start to convince
people about what advanced services are most important, and that's the
major point.  -- Nathaniel

Hmmm ... for some reason I didn't get David Morris' note, although I seem
to have received the rest of this discussion.  But Steven Majewski quoted
something that I'd like to respond to.

David Morris wrote:

Just before the January USENIX, a colleague said much the same thing to me.
Then I went to USENIX, and was surprised at how many people were talking
seriously about agents in one form or another (no less than seven of the
speakers and presenters dealt with agents).  I mentioned this difference of
perspective to my boss later, and he noted that just 10 years ago, a great
many people were saying confidently that it was sheerest folly to ever connect
to a network, and that they would never do it.  Today, in spite of the
security implications, many of those same people would not think of doing
business without a network connection of some sort.  The perceived benefits
outweigh the risks.

He, and I, suspect that the same shift in perception will occur with regard
to agents.  There are still huge open questions, and Steven makes a good case
that we perhaps need to shift our focus in deciding how to build agents.  But
I have come to believe that agents will become important, and a lot of people
who currently take David Morris' view will find their attitude changing.

Gee thanks, Rick. I wonder: how many "What's OAK? Can you give

Folks: this list has lots of readers these days. And it's archived.
I like to go back through the archive, and it's nice when folks include

The poster usually has a URL farily handy -- it takes a minute or

Having the highlight tag actually seems simpler to me.  The search engine
(but not the http server) knows what constitutes a match as the search
results are being accumulated.  It is very easy for the search engine to
insert highlight tags at this point.  And it is a no-brainer for the browser
to handle the higlight tags.

If the client is to reconstruct the matching patterns by searching on text,
then the highlighting function is limited to searches that are simple text
matches.  For instance, simple clients probably would not support
highlighting when the seach criterion was "the document has a paragraph that
contains both the words 'test' and 'diagnostic'".  The client would likely
highlight all words 'test' and 'diagnostic', even if they did not appear in
the same paragraph.

Let the search engine report on its results with the highlight tag - this
allows any search algorithm to report on any useful information.  This also
means that simple clients will work with any search algorithm.

I believe in the need for the function of this tag, (i.e. it makes
sense for search engines to show users what portions of a document
were relevant) but I am unconvinced that a new tag is the way to
do it.  

1) It's not clear to me what the meaning of this tag is.  One
definition might be "in a document returned by running a search, the
elements within the document that caused it to be selected".  Another
might be "the passages within a document that matched the search
criteria".  Both seem plausible and useful to me, but they are different.

Suppose I'm searching for a paragraphs with both "data" and "actor".
Under the first definition, only the words "data" and "actor" would be
highlighted.  Under the second, the whole paragraph would.  There are
probably other viable definitions.  What's more, I am not sure what
happens (in the first definition) if the search included a NOT.

2) It's not clear how this tag relates to other cases of marking
passages within documents as "special" in some way.  One example is
"strike out" text. [The HTML 2.0 spec (of July 94) has a STRIKE tag
for this purpose.]  Are there other examples?  Before adding another
special purpose semantic tag, it would be well to look for other cases
where such markup is needed, to make sure the design is clean.

3) A tag is not the only way to provide the function. 

First of all, why not just use existing tags such as B or EM?  Granted
this makes it hard to highlight something that's already bold, but
then again what's the client going to do in such a case anyway? (see
below).  Using B will provide the function immediately and universally
and will work in most cases.

Second, Lee Shombert claimed that there was no simple expression that
could be expressed in the header for client interpretation to indicate
which words, phrases, paragraphs or images should be highlighted.
He's right that simple schemes won't work (e.g. just listing "data"
and "actor" would fail because the client would not limit highlighting
to terms in the same para.) but more complicated schemes are possible
(e.g. a set of ranges as byte offsets into the marked up document.).
So a tag isn't *necessary* to provide

4) If the tag is adopted, then the content of the tag should be
allowed to be anything, including headers and images.  How the client
highlights text should not be specified.  Note that no single grapical
method will work, since one might wish to highlight boldfaced,
underlined, or even (ughhh) blinking material and also one might wish
to highlight imported image files.  Remember too that there are
visually impaired Web users.  We should not be adding more purely
visual tags.

I'm glad to see this discussion.  With respect to marking-up HTML on
the server side, we here have indexes of documents which reside
elsewhere.  The search engine can provide a keyword hit list, and in
some cases, the (purported) character positions for these words, but
cannot do any markup becuase the result document would be retieved
from another server.  (I'm not clear on whether character offsets
would do browsers much good.)

I suppose the browser could pass on the hit list it recieved from the
search, and the target document's server could do the markup. However,
I'm leary of a solution which requires the complexity of auto tag
insertion.

In any case, I'd like to see a solution which does not require the
search engine have access to the actual document at search time, and
does not require the search engine or indexer to parse HTML.  Oh, and
throw in the moon, while you're at it!

Cheers!

Another minor problem that I see with the tag approach to highlighting
is the possibility of the same URL being associated with 2 or more different
htmls contents.  

That is, your search engine asks for content with word X returns the url of
html page A which contains page A with all the X's surrounded by the highlight
tag.  Then, another search request for content with word Y happens to return
page A (coincidentally contains Y too), but here with all the Y's tagged.
Same URL, different associated HTML.  This creates problems for profiling,
expiration, other visited-page management facilities.

Of course, the construction of the URL being returned all depends on how you 
write your gateway... 

An implementation of highlighting using URL extensions would not create this
ambiguity.

A quick survey of current search engines that are intgrated with the 
web involve overloaded use of <STRONG> or <EM> tags for highlighting 
purposes. In many cases where HTML pages were indexed and retrieved
proper consideration for existing markup have not been handled
correctly. e.g <A HREF="/image/<STRONG>foo.gif</STRONG>">

The only problem I see with using a new tag for the expressed purpose
of search engine highlighting is that it may not be sufficiently
generalized enough as a general HTML markup and that it could creep
into manually generated documents. Is an authored <STRONG> different
than a script generated <EM>?

I believe we will see several active content document schemes deployed
in calendar year 1995 that will make it possible to have much more 
dynamic client side behavior for searching and filtering operations.
e.g. Whenever I see a hint of "terrorism", render the paragraph in 
red and sound a siren.

The forward and backward navigation could be left to PATHs at a
finer granularity that proposed earlier. Each location would need to
be named and the browser navigation would logically look something
like :
	<A HREF="#prev1">^</A>
	<A NAME="hit2"><STRONG>terrorism<STRONG></A>
	<A HREF="#next3">V</A>

This could also lead to result list navigation along the
same lines as subdocument paths.

	<A HREF="nextdoc2#nexthit4"> ...

The problem with adding this capability to the browsers, is that
there are many times that I would like to navigate over other 
types of markup as well as search hits. Could my "PageDown"
key be mapped to "Advance to the next H1 tag"? Perhaps the browser
includes support for client side searching which would let me
see a list  of <H*> tags and let me select from the local result 
list.

One of the problems with KeyWords In Context (KWIC) systems is the
limited expressiveness of results and the narrow field of recall.
I prefer the approach of the search engine specifying the region
for highlighting over a local mechanism the browser uses for
highlighting terms blindly. I want to see whole sentences selected
by the search engine that actually fulfill my information need.
e.g. "How do I print a file?" returns "<EM>A document can be sent to 
the laserwriter using the save dialog</EM>".

I have high hopes for the kinds of applications that will be enabled
with the advent of active client side content. A TABLE will be
an ideal means of expressing search result lists. An active table 
could easily sort the results my selecting one of the column headings.
Sort by name or date for fancy directory listings. These are all examples 
of safe interactions that are limited to user interactions and manipulation
of the current document contents.

I agree.  

Because of this, and also because I'd like to keep a clear distinction 
between {the base document} and {annotations to the base document (e.g. 
highlighting for search results)}, I'd prefer a solution that doesn't 
involve embedding <highlight>...</highlight> throughout the document.

Wayne's previous message described an approach that went some way toward
this -- putting the info in an attribute up in <HEAD> rather than 
throughout the <BODY> -- but I'd like to go further and have the highlight
annotations completely separate from the base document.

The client-side highlighting issue did the rounds previously on www-talk
(January?  Before the list died and was resurrected, anyway).  At the time,
I was keen to add a MIME compound type that'd contain (a) either an URL
to the base document or an inline copy of it, and (b) annotations to be
applied to that document.  Rob Hartill had cogent arguments for doing it
another way, adding the required information to URLs (as Dave Hollander
mentioned this time around).  The info in the URLs might be a lot like
some of the (server-side) URL syntax that the WN server supports.

I'm still rather fond of the MIME type rather than info in URLs, but
either approach should satisfy my main criterion (getting the annotation
information out of the base document).  

Also, either approach should be able to handle the requirement that Bill 
O'Donnell pointed out:  multiple representations of highlight information, 
rather than just a word-list.

Byte offsets will not work due to 

1) Tags (does byte offset include them or not)
2) Whitespace (for which SGML has lovely parsing rules ;-))

The functionality is needed very much. Perhaps we could have something
like:

<MARK TYPE=HIGHLIGHT START=123 END=333>

Where TYPE would indicate the role, and START and END represent word
offsets in the document, though this might well be more complicated
to handle than paired tags (though safer in terms of content model).

Ideas? The above does not feel good to me, and neither do PI's or
paired tags.

DynaWeb suffers from this, and in addition, it has named stylesheets
and whatnot, so there can be quite a large number of HTML "pages"
associated with any addressed element in the SGML document being
accessed. In addition, the auto-generated TOC's might be interesting
for Spiders...

>Of course, the construction of the URL being returned all depends on

True enough. DynaWeb has 3 subdocument addressing modes (read: URL
formats), and uses the ?foo=bar construct extensively... 

I should note that DynaWeb is a native HTTP server.

So there is a possibility for you server to be inaccurate in both hit
occurence and position?

Quite! Perhaps what we really need a low-bandwidth, graphical
rendering standard. Then we can simply render the document as we see
fit, and we get greater protection for content into the bargain
(people would have to reassemble a document from the rendering stream
to be able to steal it) ;-)

Seriously though, there are problems to be solved, and I cannot see a
truly universal solution being possible without major surgery.

With respect to all these proposals for client side
highlighting;
If we could solve this, I think we would also have a solution for
non-embedded hyperlinks, which are also a solution for shared/group
annotation.
We seem to be saying:
"I need to apply markup to this document dynamically based on results of
some operation", in this case search, in other cases, annotation.
So, I do not have a solution, just the comment that a solution would
be useful in other contexts.

A revised draft of the HTTP/1.0 specification is now available from

    http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
     ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
and 
    http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

and will eventually be available at an IETF shadow directory near you called
    draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-00.{txt,ps}
You can tell if you have the right draft by looking in the upper-left
corner of the first page for the filename.

It includes all of the requested changes from prior drafts and is
almost complete (only missing a description of URI and a couple
appendices.

No diffs are providided, since almost all lines have changed.
This would be a good time to read it very carefully and send comments
to <http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com>.

Happy reading,

That is exactly what's in the latest HTML 3 draft,
(except TYPE is named CLASS).  START is an ID attribute,
and END is an IDREF.   MARK elements must occur in pairs.

What does not feel good about it?  I think it's a very
good approach.

I predict that Safe-Tcl + a standard high level set of
services/libraries will in fact prove high level enough -- possibly with
a few tweaks/enhancements along the way -- but that there will STILL be
at least one more generation after that, for the standardization stage.

Hi all,
	I would like netscape to execute a command as defined in .mailcap 
file when a file http://host/somewhere/file.gz is loaded. It works 
perfectly for .ps, .gif and other extensions. Infact, i discovered that 
netscape doesn't read .mime.types at all! If I change the MIME type of ps 
from application/postscript to application/abcd, it still implements the 
original command.
	Could someone please suggest a way of viewing .gz|.Z files to begin 
with? I'm prepared to use an external viewer like gzcat %s | xless

Thanxall
Rupesh

Paired elements like the above mean that you have to maintain more
state when you are rendering a document (ie. you have to traverse the
entire document tree preceeding the current element, whereas with
container based control, you only need to traverse the ancestors
leading up to a node). The reason I don't like word offsets of for
much the same reason. 

This is not much of a problem with small documents, but for optimising
the redisplay of large documents, it is a very important issue. This
could also be important for optimising redisplay when scrolling.

One fellow mentioned that we need a way to solve both the
highlighting, and the annotation problem. I think using parts from
HyTime Location Module, or at least concepts from it, combined with a
multipart MIME message might be the best way to go (and it's
applicable to other media types!!!). One way or another, specifying,
and implementing, such functionality will cause some pain.

But there is no requirement for a browser to treat
marked ranges specially at all.  If a WWW user agent
*does* implement highlighting of marked ranges that cross
element boundaries, it will need to keep track of extra
state somehow anyway, regardless of how the range is
specified.

Plus, it is possible to implement this sort of thing
efficiently; see the Tk text widget for example.

HyTime -- or any mechanism that uses external links into
a document -- will only work if the server and browser 
parse the document *identically*.  If the WWW were a true
SGML application and browsers used real SGML parsers, this
would only mean that both ends would have to use the
same DTD.  That's not the case, though.

There's no telling what existing browsers do with record ends,
for example, but it's very unlikely that any are ISO 8879 compliant.
A HyTime link to the 20th through 35th characters of 
the 4th child of the element with id "FOO" can't possibly
work when browsers don't even count the same way.

I do my HTML authoring under Windows so I'm only aware of a Windows editor
that does this. It's HTML Writer (donationware). To get info on where to get
it (although it should be available in a number of anonymous ftp sites),
check out its home page at <http://wwf.et.byu.edu/~nosackk/htmlwrit.html>.

Under the HTML menu, there is a Remove Codes option that strips code from
selected text. However, it does not remove special and escaped characters
(i.e., &quot;, etc.). You have to remove these by hand.

I hope this helps.

Regards,

Cecilia Farell

Hello Ted! We're not all in Europe any more. Some of us have moved
(or are about to move) to the Boston area. This has resulted in
quite a bit of confusion, and some lack of responsiveness to
administrative requests on the www-* mailing lists.

I might mention that we had some help creating this chaos: some
crackers compromised some systems at CERN and/or MIT during the moving
period. Have you ever heard the term "denial of service attack"?
Well, you're now experiencing it first-hand.

 >  Would someone over there *please* do something to

Absolutely. We're doing our best to service the administrative requests:
by hand if necessary, but as much as possible by machine. We're investigating
better list handling software, and we're trying to hire a full-time
adminstrator[1].

Ahem. Take it easy on us! We're all doing our best.

We'd appreciate a more detailed problem report. Please give us:

1. a description of the desired behaviour (e.g. I wanted to get off
the list)

2. a description of the steps you took. e.g. Last tuesday at around 8pm, 
I sent a message to www-talk-request@w3.org with:
	unsubscribe Ted MacDonald
in the body

3. a description of the actual behavior (as opposed to the desired
behaviour) e.g. "Nothing happened, and I keep getting these messages"

If you have any more trouble, contact me personally <connolly@w3.org>
and I'll get it resolved in a timely manner.

Dan

p.s. Aurthur: would you delete Mr. MacDonald from the www-html
subscriber list, with a bazooka if necessary?

p.p.s. Everybody send mail to Aurthur <secret@w3.org> and thank him
for maintaing these lists for the last few years!

Why not let your browser do the dirty work. Most browsers support

True. The state must be managed one way or another, but with
container-based markup one can localise the state to within a given
tree or subtree, whereas with paired tags one cannot. Paired tags are
basically on par with PI's in terms of processing model. The main
problem with container-based highlighting is that highlights and such
can cross element boundaries, so in order to use such tags, one 
effectively needs to parse the document, and insert tags based on the
tree.  

Someone else has mentioned that it is probably better to have such
data seperated from the document so that the document data sent with,
and without highlighting, would be identical. I agree with this. In
addition to this, defining a standard for basic query constructs seems
desirable. Keyword search is very limiting.

>A HyTime link to the 20th through 35th characters of

>work when browsers don't even count the same way.

True, and another problem is the definition of "character", though I
don't think non-conformance of browsers is a good technical reason for
not using such links. I should note that the choice of quantum will be
important. In general, the higher the structural level of the quantum,
the more robust (in the face of application-variations) such links
should be.

I think another very important argument in favor of HyTime-like
linking is that such links can be used with data types other than
HTML. I feel it to be *very* desirable to define a general mechanism
so that all data could be treated equally. For example, what would one
do if one wants to highlight a region of a graphic or movie?

Admittedly, the overhead (in terms of implementation cost) for a
generalised mechanism will be higher than paired tags, but I think the
benefits might very well outweigh the costs.

Subject: URL syntax to return byte ranges from files
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
X-Comment: To sign off, send mail to listproc@mail.w3.org with body DEL WWW-TALK
Content-Length: 3439

I'm working on a (commercial) project to allow random access into files
stored on the Web.  We have it all working, using a simple CGI program that
takes a filename and byte range as arguments and returns the correct block
of data from the file.  Before shipping, however, I'd like to get group
input into the syntax we choose, with an eye towards being cleanly
extensible and inter-operable.

Executive Summary:
  Generalize support for WN's byte range syntax, ";bytes=<start>-<end>".
  See http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/range.html for more info.

All comments and feedback are welcome.  In particular, if anyone knows of
any other already-deployed 'standards', or a more appropriate forum for
discussion, please say so (and/or forward this message).

Thanks for your time,
  dG

===========================================================================
Problem statement:
  Define an URL syntax to return a specified byte range from a specified
  file living on the server.  Servers should be able to support the syntax
  via either a built-in extension or a CGI script.

CGI tradeoffs:

 Option 1: Use a CGI script
     Pros: simple to implement - doesn't require any server code changes
           provides the same syntax on all servers that support CGI
     Cons: requires an extra system call for each block requested
           requires the server to have CGI execution turned on
           requires a copy of the CGI script in each served directory
             (to avoid some scary security holes)
           only works with physical files located on the server's filesystem

 Option 2: Build support into the server
     Pros: more efficient
           easier to administer
           leverages all server name-mapping and security features
     Cons: requires agreement on syntax to be portable across servers
           even after agreement, newly modified servers need to be deployed

 Conclusion:
    Both options make sense and should be supported, ideally with a single
    URL syntax.  Hopefully, the CGI version will become less and less
    necessary as updated servers are rolled out.

Proposed Syntax:
  Given a base URL that identifies a document, append a modifier string to
  select a range.  The syntax of that string is ";bytes=<start>-<end>",
  where <start> and <end> are inclusive byte offsets.  The base URL can
  either be the normal document URL (for servers with built-in support) or
  a CGI URL.

Example:
  The file foo.doc is available via URL http://www.a.com/docs/foo.doc
  We want to get 512 bytes from foo.doc, starting at offset 1024.
  If the server has built-in support, the URL would be
    http://www.a.com/docs/foo.doc;bytes=1024-1535
  If using a CGI script (installed in foo.doc's directory), the URL would be
    http://www.a.com/docs/my.cgi?foo.doc;bytes=1024-1535

Note on Syntax:
  We considered several alternative syntaxes, such as:
     http://www.a.com/docs/my.cgi?foo.doc;bytes=1024+512
     http://www.a.com/docs/my.cgi?foo.doc+1024+1535
     http://www.a.com/docs/foo.doc?1024+512

  They differ mainly in punctuation and supplying a length instead of an
  ending offset.  I don't see any intrinsic benefit to most of the choices,
  so the facts that WN is shipping with a syntax, and that that syntax can
  also be cleanly used in CGI scripts, seem to carry the day.

How about resurecting #, which the client handels anyway with meaning
on the server side.  To meet the basic need, we could use:

The minimum information is which occurance of what pattern was encountered.
ODA like SGML object addressing should be employed, in the long term, 
innitially, the nth occurance of "thisExactHTMLstring" would suffice.

 ../some/url#3#The

would select the 3rd "The" from the source.

			    GENERAL INFORMATION
			    ===================

Win32s Update Information
-------------------------

Windows NT users and Win95 beta-testers
---------------------------------------
Windows NT and Win95 users don't need Win32s. The operating systems are 
32-bit operating systems with OLE support built-in. 


Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups Users
--------------------------------------------
You MUST install WIN32S BEFORE you install Mosaic. Win3.1(3.11) and Windows 
for Workgroups 3.1(WfW3.11) are 16-bit operating systems and you'll need to 
use Microsoft's Win32s software. This software will allow you to run 32-bit 
applications in Windows 3.1 or WfW 3.11. Since Mosaic is also an OLE 
compatible application, and Mosaic users must use Win32s v1.25 with the OLE 
v2.02. This version of Win32s is available at NCSA's ftp site, 
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, in the /Mosaic/Windows directory. The file W32sOLE.exe is 
a self-extracting executable. Just put this file in a temporary directory 
like c:\install, type w32sOLE, and the associated files will decompress. 
Now type install. 

Win32s v1.25 was released by Microsoft to address the foreign language 
problems and the compobj.dll problems some Windows users were experiencing 
with Win32s v1.20. We recommend you upgrade to this latest version if you 
prefer to use a language other than English(American) in your Windows 
environment, OR if you experiencing problems with the compobj.dll library 
while using Microsoft Office, Excel or Word. In general, if you are NOT 
experiencing problems with Win32s v1.20, upgrading to Win32s v1.25 is not 
required.

Subject: Client-side SELECTION; virtual anchors, colaborative hypermedia

I think I responded to the wrong question re: client-side highlighting.
Nevenmind.  My problem is client-side selection, not highlighting.

I do think it's important that we support virtual anchors addressed by
an object identifyer rather than a name.  Collaborative hypetext will require,
for example, that we select text and submit updates.  Named anchores should 
also be capable of addressing a personal or group proxy, e.g. 

<a name="theFollowingStuff" proxy="http://host.port/cgi/docMgr">stuff</a>.

Additionally, the client can route virtual and named anchor references 
through personal or group proxy servers to provide the functionality 
the user wants. (in the mean time all requests can be proxied to add
personalized functionality).  The client will need to create object identifier
anchor references for selections that are not named in the source, append
the identifier to the get, put, post, annotate, etc., and append the anchor 
reference to the url.  Some operations, such as PUT will require addition data 
to complete, but this will ultimately be the responsibility of the proxy, and
should not be implemented in the client unless the service (e.g. mail, news)
is also implimented in the client.

some/url#name  or some/url##<objectIdentifier> would provide an extensible
starting point and furtile soil for server developers of group hypermedia
support and other applications that can profit from user selected anchors.

A put operation, for example, may propose an edit that anchors existing
text to some href somewhere. The server authenticates the user, and files
the proposed update accordingly.  A personal proxy might indicate the users
proposed update on subsequent accesses to the document. A group proxy could
show the whole groups proposed links, etc.  The public proxy, named in the
actual body, p, or a tag, provies the public view of the documents evolution
and possible futures.  We may want a SELECT in HTTP distinct from GET
to present the user the menu of functionality supported by the page/anchor
via the various proxies (we'll need rules for well behaived value added
proxies).  Services that don't use the anchor part of the url, I expect, 
should ignore it.  An ADD-ANCHOR distict from PUT and LINK might be
desireable.

We don't want to provide dead end text without links, yet anchoring every
word does not work if the user wants to select a phrase.  The user selected
anchor/region provides a general solution independant of the particular
application, intuitive to users familiar with cut/copy/paste type functionality.

Increasingly we are encoding semantic information in HTML coding of documents.
User selected anchors provide a means for application developers to capture,
manupulate, and utilize such information.  Thw WEB is NOT static documents,
it is a dynamic network of information.  We need ubiquitious clients with
the power to address html segments and maniputate them in an object
oriented manner.  What I'm suggesting is a start in that direction, so
service developers can run amuck and build the knowledge bases of 
tomorrow.

HTML3 browser client for VMS.

Is one out there? Who's working on one?

NetScape doesn't have a VMS client yet that I know of, and ARENA appears to
only run on UNIX/X11 so far.

  Emacs-w3 works on VMS (tty or X) - has all of HTML 3.0 but tables and
math, which are being worked on now.

  Now that lynx is apparently being worked on again, that might be of some
use too.

I would suggest waiting until the source for Arena is released, then porting 
that. I suspect the multi-threaded stuff should port fairly cleanly onto the 
Posix threads in OpenVMS; you may need to watch out for 32-bit-isms as I doubt 
the code will be 64-bit clean (? Does Arena have an AXP OSF/1 port? If so 
that problem should be taken care of.)

In the meantime, you could look at the multi-threaded version of the W30 
common code library and see how that ports to Posix threads.

Suggest you mail the Arean team marked attention Phill Hallam-Baker, who 
will be able to give you a considered opinion about how readily the code 
will port to OpenVMS. I think Digital have finally moved from X11R4 to X11R5
so there should be few problems there.

Both Arena and the Library of Common Code supports a 64-bit architecture.

It is important to notice that the threaded model used in the Library of Common
Code (and hence Arena, Line Mode Browser etc.) is completely platform independent.
It uses one process, one stack, and one set of registers and hence it does even
run under msdos/windows. It does not require POSIX threads or any other thread
specification.

BTW: I have now a TEST VERSION of a windows port using WinSock. It is available
from

	http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html

Documentation of the threaded library can be found here as well.

Comments are welcome!

Try using the latest version of Mosaic (Beta 1). It gives you an 
option to save HTML files into plain text. But remember saving an HTML 
file only gives you the text part, the images aren't necessarily 
there... should be downloaded separetly....

I am looking for an experienced home page builder to answer 
questions.  I am doing an internship for Ulster County Community 
College and am new to the internet.  I am creating a home page for 
our college.  I get stuck with some things at times and no one around 
here really knows what they're doing.  So, it is my job to find out how 
to do it.  I am working on a Macintosh system (which I'm not too 
familiar with) and I am using Netscape as my WWW Browser.   If 
anyone can answer my questions, I will be forever grateful. 

 Here at the college we only have access to listserv's, that means: no 
newgroups or usenets, no bbs, no fun and games because it isn't 
considered educational.  If anyone knows of any other good 
resources that I can use for my project, feel free to drop me some 
E-mail.

How would you write a pathname for a file in folder within folder within 
folder on a Macintosh?

When creating links in an HTML document from the Home page to 
another file, how can you get it (with a link or command) to return to 
the home page.  I tried linking it to the home page file, but that didn't 
work.  It said  "Unable to locate file."   It found the file the first time so 
I can't understand why it won't find it the second time.

I am not familiar with listserv's.  Can someone explain to me 
graphically how it works.  Where do all the messages go?  How does 
someone read the messages that are posted?  I just don't understand 
what happens or what processes the message goes through once it is

Just in case anyone is interested, I've now moved to the Bay Area - more 
specifically Menlo Park, and the friendly arms of EIT (Enterprise 
Integration Technology). Although the basketball team isn't nearly as 
good, and I still haven't found a place to get good grits, I'm surviving :)

Now that I'm here, I'll be working on the same sort of stuff I was at 
Carolina; advanced web servers, and the HTTP-NG protocol. I'll be posting 
the current draft of the NG spec this weekend (at the moment I'm using 
someone else's DragonDictate, so I have to wait in line :-)

Hi,
	It's amazing to find more syntax being supported by these browsers 
each day. For instance, when I converted a MSWord document into text only 
form today, was shocked to see netscape 1.0 correctly interpreting octal 
codes like \225, \227 etc as bullets, regd & copyright symbols.

	Can anyone supply me a pointer to the exact set of such symbols 
supported by these browsers? Of particular interest are Mosaic & netscape 
1.{0,1}

Thanxall

  This is generally a font issue - was this in windows netscape?  Try it
with netscape/X, and it might/might not work.  I hardcoded in a few
conversions for emacs-w3 based on the more popular ones people use from
windows fonts (quotes, cpoyright, registered, etc).

Here's an excerpt on LISTSERV from the TERENA (Trans-European Research and 
Education Networking Association) home page (http://www.earn.net/)

"LISTSERV is a distribution list management package. It allows
groups of computer users with a common interest to communicate among 
themselves. It makes it very easy for even a novice user to discover, 
join and participate in these interest group mailing lists. LISTSERV also 
provides facilities for logging and archiving of mail traffic, file 
server functions, and database searches of archives and files."

You could get more info on LISTSERV by sending an e-mail with the 
command HELP or INFO to listserv@listserv.net.

Or you could ftp LISTSERV info at EARN's ftp site: ftp.earn.net in the 
directory /pub/doc/listserv/ to get a user's guide to LISTSERV.

This isn't a _FONT_ issue, it is a _CHARACTER SET_ issue. HTML is
normatively sent in ISO-8859-1, a character set that has several
special characters in it. If you're building a browser that accepts
HTML, you should do the best you can rendering ISO-8859-1 on the
user's terminal, even if you don't have the right fonts. Similarly, if
a server has documents written using something other than ISO-8859-1
(e.g., Macintosh character set) it should either _translate_ the
document into the right character set or else _label_ it
appropriately:
content-type: text/html;charset="whatever"

This is especially true if you want to send, oh, Korean documents to
Korean-capable clients. Don't rely on the happenstance of
client/server accidentially translating the characters the same way!

We have to head off this particularly nasty barrier to
interoperability. You don't have to all use the same character set,
but please pay attention to the charset and label the things that you
have.

(I'm getting on WMPerry's case because he's the implementor of
the browser that _I_ use most frequently. :))

Hello there.

Has anyone had any luck running Netscape on top of Spry's tcp/ip stack -- 
i.e. Internet in a Box?  I haven't been able to get it to work, and am 
wondering if there is a conflict betwen the two, or a quick fix.

Also, are there any really easy to use implementations of winsock that 
work effectively with Netscape?  I downloaded a copy of trumpet, but 
don't have the time to play with it.  Is chameleon a faster way to go, 
and will Netscape work effectively on top of that stack?

Thanks much,

Steve Habib Rose

     Never tried Netscape with Spry.  However, it works fine on both 
     NetManage Chameleon and Trumpet. Trumpet ain't that hard to set 
     up and you'll save yourself beaucoup bucks by going that way !

This is a long reply to a long post to many lists so I am summarizing
the ideas at the top.
This will allow you to hit delete right away.

This message contains suggestions for developing ideas mentioned by
Steven along the same lines but with some very specific implementation
details included.

Summary :-
---------

Separate out the "safe" functionality in safe-tcl from the generic language
facilites.

Put the "safe" functionality in a set of libraries ( locally extensible )
in an Agent API.

Define an intermediate language ( agent-lingua-franca ) which is the content
of the enabled mail message. All "favorite" scripting languages will
be converted to agent-lingua-franca by MUA extensions.

Agent-lingua-franca is the output of client-side MUA's.
Agent-lingua-franca is the input to the host side facility which
receives the message.
An agent-lingua-franca interpreter at the host side converts it
into  usual generic language operations like control flow, variable manipulation
etc. + calls to the standard Agent API.

Back-end the client-side enabled-mail creation facility with a lingua-franca
converter which converts my favorite religious language to lingua-franca.

Front-end the host side "safe" facility with an agent-lingua-franca interpreter.
Incoming enabled mail is un-MIME'ed and then fed as a script to this
interpreter.


Why create "yet another language" when safe-tcl will do ?
Well, safe-tcl won't do, except for those who already like safe-tcl.
There are hundreds of thousands of people who program for a living and would
like to use their favorite scripting language to do enabled mail.
An intermediate language let's them do that.

Being familiar with the MS Windows side of things and being a lurker
on this list I have been thinking about the "agent-language-standard"
issue for a while and have come to the same conclusion.
While other Object technologies like CORBA, DSOM, OpenDoc have been
mentioned, one approach worth noting is that taken in OLE2.0.
I am not an MS fan, nor a Windows-only developer, I came across this
technology as I had to write a requirements spec involving OLE2.0.

In the OLE2.0 approach, all object facilities are provided in libraries
and the calling interfaces are published as the OLE 2.0 Spec., as a
binary standard ( without language bindings ) ie a way to push and
pop on and off the stack.
 
The libraries created by MS are considered *one* implementation of the spec.

In this way 

1) Other implementations of the spec can be created.

2) The facilities are available in a language independent fashion - use your
   own favorite scripting language.

3) The facilites can be added incrementally as they are available in
   a number of DLL's, grouped by subfunction.

This, in my engineering opinion, is the way to go for agent functionality.

I will elucidate further, but we take a break now for flamers to
let off steam ( is that a mixed metaphor ? )

[...]

We agree here.

> because he's not quite sure what *exactly* he wants to do. 

I don't want to speak for Nathaniel but I'd like to put in my 2c worth as to
why a single language is not only a "Bad thing" ( TM ) but if one proposes
a single language philosophy then safe-tcl will lose. This will
happen simply because of the
sheer volume of users of say Visual Basic if MS were to push it as the 
"agent language" along with some half baked modifications and extensions
to MAPI etc.
General Magic's Telescript also shows such things are possible.

Besides, it is simply impractical to expect programmers with investment
of time in their favorite language, to switch over to safe-tcl when
they don't quite understand the technical reasons. Note that all the people
I am referring to in the above statement are not subscribed to this list
and will pick up something incrementally close to what they understand
rather than make a complete context switch.

On the other hand, take the example of BSD sockets. By creating a 
call level interface - Winsock, sockets functionality and in effect
access to a whole new area of programming was made available to a
very "different" community of programmers, with tremendous success.

This leads us to the dreaded "A" word. Do I dare utter it in these 
hallowed corridors ... ?  API - there I said it. API, API, API.
I'm still alive :->.

Perhaps, what is needed is a set of function calls, described as an
API, that provide the core of what is considered "safe" functionality.
While safe-tcl extensions are a way to extend safe-tcl what they are
is a set of function calls added to the original safe-tcl core.

Given this possibility a different problem arises - if people can use their
favorite scripting language how can the site hosting the "safe" facility
know what language to expect in enabled mail messages ?
Will the safe facility become a disjoint union of interpreters for
every imaginable language ?

It's possible, perhaps, to have something like a RMS's scheme idea where
safe-tcl and other languages be hosted by an underlying scheme interpreter -
but this still begs the question. You still need to write the 
interpreter for the n'th language before an e-mail message in the n'th
language is received - not something achievable in general.

Now I will really go out on a limb, but this is the only solution to
the problem above ( I believe ) :-

Instead of specifying a single high level language standard - like safe-tcl -
specify instead an *intermediate* language which is the only language
the "safe" host is expected to interpret.  the "safe" host interprets this
byte-code-like-but-better language and transaltes it into calls to a
standard set of library calls ( with local extensions ) - the Agent API.

On the mail-sender side :-

The mail sender creates an enabled mail program in his/her favorite
scripting language and submits it to a local client side enabled-mail-byte-code
-language-spitter-outer which of course spits out the standard byte-code-like-
but-better enabled-mail-language.

It is this language, ( intermediate language ), that is sent in the mail
and acted upon at the receiving end.

Now if you want to convert safe-tcl into that language and separate
out the "safe" functionality into an API, that might work.
Anyone want to do a VB-safe-tcl converter ? Telescript-safe-tcl ?

I am not suggesting this for any technical reasons, just for practical, 
down to earth reasons, like widespread acceptance in all programming 
communities including the PC based MS Windows community, for reasons like
not allowing someone with a larger installed base set the agenda for
enabled-mail, for reasons like not wanting your children to become
Visual Basic enabled MAPI programmers.

Yes, that's necessary before creating an API.

     The Winsock that ships with Chameleon works great with Netscape. No 
     setup of fiddling involved. I've used Netscape with Chameleon NFS for 
     a few months now without a lick of trouble.

I have been testing both Trumpet and Chameleon. Trumpet is nice because
it starts, dials and logs in automatically once you start Netscape. On the
other hand, I haven't found any Mail application which would work with
Trumpet. Does anyone know?

Chameleon has Mail and lots of other stuff, but you have to start it
separately, which is not so nice. Or does anyone know how to start 
it from Netscape?

Hello

I have written a patch for the Mosaic-2.6a1 to get NoProxy-support 
via Xressource.

f.e.
	Mosaic*noProxy: 	fh-wolfenbuettel.de:cle.de


This patch is also available from

	ftp://ftp.fh-wolfenbuettel.de/WWW-FHWF/misc/


A patched version for Solaris 2.4 (dynamic!) you can get from

	ftp://ftp.fh-wolfenbuettel.de/WWW-FHWF/SunOS5/


Have fun with this stuff :)


Bye bye Thorsten

I have been using Trumpet 2.0 with the free version of Eudora with no 
problems. You might want to try this combination.

Where I am having terrible problems is getting Trumpet 2.0, TIA, the WinVN 
newsreader on a Netcom shell account to work.  Has anyone been able to get 
a combination like this working?


Thanks

Larry Alexander

Jyrki et al,

J>On the other hand, I haven't found any Mail application which would work
with Trumpet. Does anyone know?

Eudora from qualcomm works great with trumpet.  I'm using it now.   The
professional version has "filters" which you can use to direct this list's
stuff into one nice pile.

You can have netscape and eudora open at the same time; send mail while
you're surfing...

Hi everyone,
I need some clarification about the revisions html has. More specifically, I
want to know if the versions of html are 1.0, 2.0, html+ and html 3.0, if
there is some correlation between them, if I'm missing one, if html+ and
html 3.0 are the same thing, etc.
Can anyone help?
thanks in advance!!

( I apologize if you receive this announcement more than once.   Please note
that the deadline for position papers is extended to April 30, 1995. )
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Announcing a  NEW  feature at ACM SIGCOMM's annual Technical Symposium:

			      An Invited
			WORKSHOP on MIDDLEWARE
			  28-29  AUGUST 1995
			
		   immediately preceding  SIGCOMM95
		     30 August - September 1 1995

			  CAMBRIDGE, MA  USA

IMPORTANT!!!  The deadline for a brief position paper is APRIL 30, 1995.


Workshop Program Committee:
        Ken Birman - Cornell                 David Gifford - MIT          
        Barry Leiner - ARPA                  Larry Masinter - Xerox       
        Michael Schwartz - U. Colorado       Karen Sollins - MIT
        Jay Weber - EIT                      Lixia Zhang - Xerox

With the growth of the Internet and the corresponding agreement on a common
network and transport infrastructure comes a new opportunity. The consensus
on the use of the TCP/IP protocol suite, including protocols for routing,
addressing, and forwarding of packets, end-to-end transport mechanisms, and
standard protocols for file transfer, remote login, electronic mail and
network management has resulted in a wide spread interoperable networking
infrastructure. This in turn is creating tremendous opportunities for new
and innovative services to be provided over the network. An example of this
is the rapid evolution of the World-Wide Web in the last several years.

At the same time, the explosive growth in availability and use of the
Internet is creating new challenges. The existing infrastructure must be
extended if it is to continue to scale in numbers of users, offer bandwidth
guarantees, and support new classes of network applications. These trends
demand that we raise the level of common services and introduce new types
of higher-level services. Interoperable information management, search, and
retrieval mechanisms would create opportunities for new third-party
information services. Interoperable payment mechanisms would spur the
evolution of electronic commerce. Interoperable multimedia representation
formats and exchange protocols would spur a new generation of group support
tools. There are opportunities to create many such middleware components,
including caching and replication services, indexing services, remote
scripting environments, data typing and structuring primitives, and higher
level communication abstractions such as multicast and causal broadcast.

The purpose of this workshop is to explore this area of middleware
infrastructure. A specific objective is to identify and discuss those areas
of services that would sit "above" the traditional network protocols and
provide means for extending the the commonly available services on the
network to enclose higher layers of abstraction. A critical question to be
addressed is the balance between standardization and the exploration of new
concepts for middleware services. Thus, identifying the appropriate level
for standardization and interoperability is expected to be a major topic of
discussion at the workshop. We plan to discuss the vision for where
middleware is heading. For example, what kind of middleware support is
needed for the integration of databases, information spaces (such as WWW),
and personal communication tools. Finally, engineering issues in middleware
implementation will be of interest. Questions will be addressed such as how
to engineer the interface between middleware and TCP and how to take
advantage of underneath IP multicast support in caching and replication
services.

The workshop will be organized based on invited participants. A workshop of
approximately 75 people is anticipated. Brief (no more than three pages)
position papers are welcome to aid in the selection of workshop invitees.
These position papers are due no later than 30 April 1995. The workshop
itself will last 1.5 days immediately preceding the main SIGCOMM'95
conference ( the afternoon of August 28 and all day August 29th ).

Position papers should be sent by electronic mail in ascii to
        SC95WS@mercury.lcs.mit.edu. 
Questions should be addressed to the Workshop Program Chair, 
        Dr. Barry M. Leiner, BLeiner@arpa.mil.

  I removed them for the next release.  Sheesh. :)

  What should the charset for the windows set be?

Content-type: text/html ; charset="broken-windows-shit"

  Seems good to me.

Steve, I can run Netscape on Spry's tcp/ip with no problem. Have you 
checked the .ini file of your Netscape browser? The conflict may be 
there. Just a thought.

In article <3k4hss$l06@stratus.CAM.ORG> you write:

Don't think about it. HTML is not an LR(1) grammar and so trying to use yacc
is only going to cause pain. The best way of parsing SGML is with a top down 
recursive descent parser. Try to use yacc and you will end up in all sorts of
troubles, especially with error reporting.

One of the problems with comp sci courses is that lecturers often make
silly statments such as bottom up parsing being somehow better than top down. 
This is not the case. Bottom up parsers can be made slightly faster but at
a disproportionate cost in terms of complexity. My view is that a language 
requiring a yacc parser is probably too complex in any case. Nobody uses
an LR(1) parser to parse LISP.

You might want to have a look at my server her at home 
(http://www.ludvigsen.hiof.no/) its MacHTTP running on a Mac IIsi (2 
MacIIsis actually, but that's another story). Most of your questions will 
be answered by using the "view source" facility in your browser.

Subject: CGI PATH_TRANSLATED variable?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas

I ran into this when I wrote user-cgi, and hand-waved my way through
it. The documentation on PATH_TRANSLATED on hoohoo is vague. The link
to CGI information on w3.www.org is to hoohoo.  Now I've got a server
working (you can watch it at http://www.phone.net/, and read the draft
docs at http://www.phone.net/aws/) and need to get things clarified.

Anyone want to try to explain what the "translate version of
PATH_INFO" should be? I know, it does any "virtual-to-physical"
mapping, but what does that MEAN? After all, any server I've run that
has cgi scripts has two mappings - one takes /cgi-bin to a set of
programs to be run (so, if I get /cgi-bin as the prefix of PATH_INFO,
I should run the program???), and one that takes other files to a
directory. Most of them have many such mappings.

The server I'm building allows multiple virtual-to-physical mappings.
One always returns a 204 result, no matter what the rest of the URL
is. Even worse, it allows for multiple mappings of the same URL. I.e.
- it will look in multiple trees for a file designated by a given URL,
and if it fails to find all of those it could wind up returning a 204
because it got passed to 204-returning map.

So, could someone please enlighten me as to what I should be doing
with PATH_TRANSLATED? Better yet, could someone give me an example of
it being used, or the justificatoin that went into it being included
in the spec?

	Thanx,

If I recall correctly, it contains the actual path to the CGI program
and the PATH_INFO.   For example, if you have a URL:

	http://host.com/cgi-bin/prog/the/path

that results in the program

	/usr/web/cgi-bin/prog

being run with PATH_INFO set to "/the/path", then PATH_TRANSLATED is:

	/usr/web/cgi-bin/prog/the/path

Rob McCool had some pretty good sounding use for this, but I don't
remember what it was and a fairly quick perusal of the www-talk archives
didn't turn up much.

Disclaimer:  I never did bother putting this in my server so I may be way
wrong.

Neither NetSite nor NCSA 1.3 behave that way. Given the above URL and
program, they both produce:

	/htdocs/the/path

Given that both servers are running with multiple trees, this seems
strange.

So there is a precedent for what I'm doing. Good.

Not quite.  If you have the serverroot at
  /var/web
and you have /htdocs and /cgi-bin  in the serverroot dir, and you have
two documents in /htdocs called  
  /foo.html and /baz/bar.html
then a request for /var/web/htdocs/foo.html looks like this
   http://yourserver/foo.html
and baz/bar.html is
   http://yourserver/baz/bar.html

Running through a gateway at
   http://yourserver/cgi-bin/script
the request using PATHINFO .html would be
   http://yourserver/cgi-bin/script/foo.html
      PATH_INFO= /foo.html
      PATH_TRANSLATED= /var/web/htdocs/foo.html

while
   http://yourserver/cgi-bin/script/baz/bar.html
      PATH_INFO= /baz/bar.html
      PATH_TRANSLATED= /var/web/htdocs/baz/bar.html

The advantage is that the server will do user-dir escaping for you, so
   http://yourserver/cgi-bin/script/~baz/bar.html
      PATH_INFO= /~baz/bar.html
      PATH_TRANSLATED= /u/baz/public_html/bar.html

This makes it easy to open the files and process them in the script.
Check  http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/mogens/script.html  for an example
of path_info use.

Yes, but note that this assumes that all your html documents live in
one tree. What if that's not the case? In particular, what if your
server could hand either of /var/web/htdocs/foo.html or
/var/web/htdocs-new/foo.html if someone tryed to GET
http://yourserver/foo.html?

> Running through a gateway at

Should PATH_TRANSLATED be /var/web/{htdocs,htdocs-new}/foo.html for
the case I've got?

This only applies if your server does user-dir escaping. Mine doesn't
(yet, anyway).

Hi there,

I need somebody who knows about a simple HTML viewer for Microsoft 
Windows, only for browsing multimedia data located on hard disk, not on 
the net. We are constructing a radiological educational multimedia 
database for our medical students. It will be accessible via Internet, 
but we would like to transfer all data to CD-ROM (of course in the same
format: HTML!). That's why I'm looking for a very simple public 
domain/free/shareware hypertext (HTML) viewer which can be enough browsing 
data on CD-ROM. This data will be public, too. 

Thank you for your help,

I am putting together a list of Internet service providers who furnish 
space on their WWW servers for non-commercial do-it-yourself home page 
publishers. The list would be for those people who would like to have 
their home page available on the net who have a provider not offering the 
service.


It would be nice if the service were free, but inexpensive is 
also good :-) I'm aware of the service at Ohio State University.

If you send information to me directly, I'll check it out and publish the 
complete list here, with details, here on this list at a later date.

  The CERN Line Mode Browser (www) is a character based World-Wide Web
  Browser. It is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool
  for the CERN Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode,
  non-interactive mode and as a proxy client. In non-interactive mode it
  can be used as a powerful tool in CGI scripts for the CERN httpd.
  Furthermore it gives a variety of possibilities for data format
  conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool
  for quick access to the Web or used in batch jobs.

                            *  *  *  *  *

This is the official release of the CERN Line Mode Browser version
3.0. Together with the Library of Common Code it has now reached a
stable state where experiments can be done.

The Line Mode Browser is copyrighted by CERN and the copyright
statement is available in the source destribution file.

CERN Line Mode Browser 3.0 is available as source code:

        http://www.w3.org/pub/src/WWWLineMode_3.0.tar.Z
        ftp://www.w3.org/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_3.0.tar.Z

Its is known to compile on Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake, NeXT, NeXT-386,
Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI and AIX, but look also at the page
of supported platforms at:

CERN Line Mode Browser Release Notes

Very little has changed in the user interface, but it is now stable.

Pre-release 3.0pre2

* The browser is now much more stable and has the same amount of
  functionality as the previous version 2.15

Pre-release 3.0pre1

Most of the code is reorganized in order to adapt the application to
the multithreaded version of the Library. This means that the browser
	now has the following new features:

* Interruptible I/O - hit 'z RETURN' and the current load terminates

* You can at any time initiate a new load or any other command by
  simply start typing.

The Line Mode Browser has done it again!

Have fun!

  The CERN Common WWW Library is a general code base that can be used
  as a basis for WWW clients and servers. It contains code for accessing
  HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system. 
  Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting
  hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic programming
  utilities.

                            *  *  *  *  *

This release is the official 3.0 release of the Library of Common Code
from CERN. The release is the result of three previous pre-releases and
has now reached a stable state which is the reason for this
release. Thanks for the many contributions! The list of new features,
bug fixes etc. is very long, but most of it can be found in the
Programmer's Guide mentioned below. Some of the most importants features
is a multithreaded HTTP module and a initial port to Windows/Windows NT.

As usual, the CERN Line Mode Browser is also released in order to show
how the library can be used. This release is described in its own
announcement.

The Library is copyrighted by CERN and the copyright statement is
available in the source destribution file.

NOTE: The CERN server is NOT compatible with this version of the
Library, but must be linked with version 2.17 which is also available
from our source archives.

CERN Common Code Library 3.0 is available as source code from:

        http://www.w3.org/pub/src/WWWLibrary_3.0.tar.Z
        ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_3.0.tar.Z

Its is known to compile on Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake, NeXT, NeXT-386,
Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI, AIX, Windows 3.1 and but look also at
the page of supported platforms at:

CERN Library 3.0 Release Notes

Many of the modifications and new features are mentioned under the
pre-releases.

 * Changed all float to double in order get it consistent with the
   working floating type in C

 * Fixed problems with memory in HTML.c

 * Introduced definition of errno constants for WIN32,
   as WinSock doesn't define them using BSD notation

CERN Library 3.0 Prerelease 3, Mar 10 1995

New or Changed Features

 * All library include files which contains public information for
   applications are now contained in the single include file WWWLib.h
   which is the only one necessary PLEASE DON'T USE ANYTHING ELSE!!!

 * Changed TRACE messages so that the target is the macro TDEST and
   not stderr. This means that on platforms that don't support stderr,
   TRACE messages can be redirected to a local file.

 * Due to the PC Port some modules (definition and declaration files)
   have changed names so that the max length is 8 characters:

	s?HTFWriter?HTFWrite?g
	s?HTHistory?HTHist.h?g
	s?HTEPtoClient?HTEPtoCl?g
	s?HTDescript?HTDescpt?g
	s?HTExtParse?HTXParse?g
	s?HTErrorMsg?HTErrMsg?g

 * Move EnableFrom to HTAccess module. This variable determines
   whether the HTTP header From: should be generated. The default
   value is off

 * Sockets are no longer assumed to be small, non-negative integers,
   but uses macros. This should ensure portability to Windows NT.

 * Introduced socerrno and errno so that WinSock can use its own
   definition whereas `local' errno can still use the well-known version.

 * Introduced error_stream as field in HTRequest structure. All
   information contained in HTTP responses which don't naturally contain
   a body entity, for example redirection codes (3xx) and client error
   codes (4xx) will be put down this stream so that it can be put into a
   debug window.

 * HTNewsHost is now a local variable in the HTNews module. Use
   HTGetNewsHost and HTSetNewsHost to set and get the current value. The
   news module will be rewritten in the near future as it has many
   problems.

 * The HTTP module understands all HTTP/1.0 return codes and is more solid

 * Many portability problems has been solved and optimized. Most
   system dependent things are now put into
   tcp module

 * Interface to CSO name server made nicer - generates correct HTML

Bug Fixes

 * file:// no more tries ftp:// if host=localhost

 * Improved proxy support and fixed bug when reloading a document from a proxy

 * Bug fixed in HTGetHostName() which didn't include a dot <.>;

 * Bug fixed if UserID/passwd was not correct and don't want to retry

 * HTErrorAdd and HTErrorSysAdd no always return HT_ERROR

 * Fixed bug in HTGetDomainName when no domain name is present at all

 * Add output_flush to request structure

 * Uses IOCTL as a macro now - not fcntl

Library 3.0 Prerelease 2, Dec 2 1994

 * Introduced memory cleanups from Eric Sink into HTLibTerminate()

 * Now the client can provocate a call to HTEventRequestTerminate()
   even when the request never enters the eventloop. This is necesary so
   that the client can cancel busy icons, spinning globes etc.

 * Introduced EVENT_TERM as return code for the HTEventHandler function

 * HTEventHandler() now has a double pointer so that the request
   pointer can be modified from the client

 * Fixed bug in HTSearch() and HTLoadRelative() where wrong return
   code was returned (BOOL instead of int)

 * Introduced BlockingIO field in the request structure to override
   the the mode registered in the protocol structure. This can be used as
   an easy way to make blocking I/O

Library 3.0 Prerelease 1, Nov 26 1994

New and Changed Features

 * Introduced the function HTLibInit() and HTLibTerminate() which
   MUST be called when the application starts up and terminates.

 * Introduced the modules HTThread and HTEvent. HTEvent is the client
   interface when using multithreaded functionality and HTThread is the
   internal socket management

 * All __STDC__ defines now concentrated to HTUtils.html where it is
   called _STANDARD_CODE_ so that _cplusplus also handles this

 * `new' and `template' not used a names anymore (confuses C++)

 * Removed from field in HTRequest structure. This is now handled by
   the functions HTGetMailAddres and HTSetMailAddress and the flag
   HTEnableFrom in the HTTP module.

 * Changed HTSetMailAddress so that a call with parameter equals NULL
   or "" clears the contents of the mail-address.

 * The number of parameters to Streamstack function is now compatible
   with the arguments to a stream converter, so that we don't loose any
   information while putting up the stream stack.

 * HTOutputSource variable is removed. You should use WWW_SOURCE in
   the request structure

 * HTGuess stream is a a converter compatible stream so that it
   actually can be setup as a converter

 * The stream methods `abort' and `_free' now returns int instead of
   void. On success from these methods `_free' returns 0 and `abort'
   return EOF

 * Taken HTEscape and HTUnescape and put them into the HTEscape
   module. The functionality is the same but now they can be used in
   utility programs without linking in the whole Library

Bug Fixes

 * Removed bug in WAIS module which caused a lot of core dumps

 * Removed bug in format classification from URL suffix in HTGoper
   when the file was plaintext
 
 * localhost is now recognized again after canonicalization
   in HTLoadFile()

 * WAIS SEARCH now produces proper HTML

 * Max number of lines in WAIS decreased to 200 as 250 (previous)
   dumps core

 * Bug fixed in HTGetHostName() if we must use the getdomainname() function.

 * Added some support for SCO

 * Handling of gopher items of type ERROR (3) changed so no more core
   dumps in server

Have fun!

Hi,

We've recently setup a web page on a unix machine to serve a 
macintosh demo program.  Whats the best file format to serve
such files?  Is it .bin?

I would really apreciate if someone could share their experience
with such files.  Right now people are having difficulty downloading
the demo.   Try Cyberight's homepage at:

     http://guinness.huma.yorku.ca/socsci/cyberight.html

Thanks,

        I'm missing something.   What CGI variable holds the  "extra
info"  after the  "real path".   By example,  if someone requests

                http://myserver/htbin/imagemap/mapname?x,y

        resulting in

                GET /hbtin/imagemap/mapname?x,y [HTTP/1.0]

        I would expect

                PATH_TRANSLATED=/server/root/hbtin/imagemap
                PATH_INFO=mapname
                QUERY_STRING=x,y

        (where PATH_INFO might alternatively be "/mapname")

If it is a Mac-specific file, yes, .bin (MacBinary) is preferred. Remember,
though, that your users will still have to have StuffIt Expander (or
MacBinary II+) to separate out the data and resource forks of the file into
their normal arrangement -- MacBinary collapses the two forks into one so
that the file may be transported in binary format without loosing the data
fork.

I'd download the demo to make sure your file isn't corrupted, but I'm on
the end of a 14.4K modem. :-(

     There has been discussion regarding Netscape, Trumpet, and Chameleon.  
     I have run them and prefer the Netscape/Chameleon combination because 
     it has been the most stable.  I am having a problem switching my 
     laptop (running Windows for Workgroups) from Trumpet/Netscape to 
     Chameleon/Netscape. No matter what I do, when I launch Netscape I get 
     a dialog with a title: Trumpet Winsock, and a message that tcpman.exe 
     could not be found.  I have deleted Trumpet, searched for all ini and 
     other configuration files, reinstalled Netscape, and still can't get 
     it to work.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any help would be 
     greatly appreciated.
     
     thanks,

Well, there's CERN's overview of WWW servers at
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html>. However, I have
not visited it for a while so I'm not sure what its status is. Also, the W3
home has moved to www.w3.org, so I'm not sure if this info has been moved
there from CERN. If you don't find it, you might want to check
<http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html>.

Hope this helps.

Cecilia Farell

Phill is technically correct (that one cannot parse SGML and hence
HTML using YACC et al).

If one limits oneself to a subset of SGML, it is quite possible to
produce a YACC grammer. Dan Connolly has produced such a grammar for
HTML by hacking DTD2HTML, and the TEI folks have produced an
*excellent* and very *useful* subset of SGML, and the grammar is
available at:

   ftp://ftp-tei.uic.edu/pub/TEI

While these can accept come documents that are not quite legal SGML,
99.9% of documents I've seen would be both legal withing the TEI
grammar, and within SGML.

Does anyone know if reviews exist comparing the various servers (NCSA, 
CERN, etc.) on various platforms? 

There is a review file for archive servers that describes install, 
features, ease of use, caveats, etc. 
(ftp://ftp.netcom.com/wu/wuapub/archive_servers). Does something similar 
exist for WWW servers, especially for the UNIX platform?


Curiously,
Larry Alexander

We are currently developing such a thing. It will be able to
download a whole bunch documents following all the links. Well, not
*all* the links since this would provide you with the contents of
the whole Web (or more likely run out of disk space before).

More likely you will limit access to a single server or a subset of
it. Example: Start with
<http://www.nads.de/~klute/WWW-Kompendium/> but don't follow links
pointing outside http://www.nads.de/~klute/WWW-Kompendium.

Since it is be reasonable to follow some links to the outside,
downloading documents up to a certain configurable "distance"
from the starting tree is also supported.

While following links you can check the integrity of your (or
someone else's) Web at the same time.

This stuff is already running quite nicely. Storing the documents
on a DOS filesystem is presently under work. Using a DOS filesystem
may seem a bit awkward to you, but it has some advantage: You can
put a set of documents on a disk(ette), take some WWW client
for Windows, and show the Web to someone on his own PC without an
Internet connection.

Can someone give me advise for the following:

I want to offer for a few users a nice way to transfer files from a PC to a
WWW-server. I need to write a script to do this job and probably it has to
run on the PC. The problem is that I want to activate the script by the
server. So one of my pages on the server will have a button to start the
script. 

I have already seen some solutions that use a special browser that
recognizes special URL's, but I do not want to restrict the users to the use
of one specific browser. 

Another solution would be to make use of the MIME-types to start the script.
The button will be linked to a file with a special extension such as ".add"
and if the user has extended the MIME-types of the browser in a right way it
has to work???

Thanks in advance.

Manuel.

But why bother?

Parsing SGML with a top down recursive decent parser based on an FSR is
by far the simplest approach to implement and also produces correct code.
Why would anyone want to use an inappropriate tool which does the job less
well and is more difficult to use?

Yacc is OK if you actually have an LR(1) grammar. But its best to steer well
clear of it otherwise. In addition error handling was never really though out 
properly for yacc. I've never seen anyone sucessfully use the error 
productions without comming a cropper.

HTML2.0 is just about parsable with yacc but HTML3 is pretty awfull. Especially
the maths extensions since they use some of the character set shifting 
functions. This part is distinctly non LR(1) and the best, most compact 
definition of the grammar is produced using a push-down automata.


I think the problem lies in comp sci classes being taught that bottom up 
parsing is `better' and the students not asking why. Goldfarb would not know
an LR(1) grammar if one bit him on the nose. If he had SGML might not fall 
into the "much wailing and gnashing of teeth" catogory which it does.


PS: I have discovered that the correct pronunciation of "ASN.1" is "assasin 1".

Hello,

I hope you can make this public.  It is very interesting.  I'd like to do
the same thing, except that I'd transport the Web docs through UUCP to
sites that only have dialup, batched access.  I'd like to get daily diffs
between what the site has and the current state of the real Web.
I believe this is best done through a CERN httpd proxy cache, which saves
the web documents and files under a directory hierarchy.

Such a thing would increase the audience of the Web to non-IP sites, such
as BBSes and non-profits which might not want to spare time, equipment and
connection fees on even SLIP/PPP.  Of course, no interactive forms, searches,
etc.

True enough. I was just pointing out that it's not impossible, and in
particular, recommending the TEI subset.

Quite! yacc error productions fall into the "black art" category at
the very least.

Well, the other thing is that many people perceive writing a recursive
descent parser to be harder than writing a YACC grammar
description. I'm not sure this is true. I'll be perfectly honest and
say that over the last 10 years, less than a third of the parsers I've
written used YACC (though flex is a godsend, at least for
prototyping). I saw one interesting parser concept which used "event
handlers" to create a very loosely coupled FSM. Quite interesting, and
very fast too.

Or perhaps asinine ;-)

Thanks for all for recommending mail software.

The way, I figured, Netscape finds Trumpet is that it tries to find file
WINSOCK.DLL from Windows directory, and if there is none, then from 
directories on the autoexec path. Then, Trumpet's DLL will look for 
TCPMAN, Chameleon's for CUSTOM, and so on...

A good advice is to:

-keep Trumpet files, including Trumpet WINSOCK.DLL, in \TRUMPET
 subdirectory. Remove all other WINSOCK.DLLs, or keep them in a
 place where Netscape can not find them. Remember, Netscape uses the
 first DLL it finds, so path /trumpet;/netmanage will start Trumpet and
 path /netmanage;/trumpet will start Chameleon. 

-put /trumpet in your path statement in autoexec. Remove /netmanage.

-Trumpet has a setting for autodial, put it on (check Trumpet menu).

-if you want to use Chameleon, remove /trumpet from your path
 and use /netmanage instead.

You are still using Trumpet's WINSOCK.DLL. Replace it with Chameleon's
DLL.

I use Windows for Workgroups, 4 Meg RAM, Netscape and Trumpet.
I have problems occasionally, but so seldom that it does not matter.

Have a nice weekend.

I totally disagree.

I see no reason for safe-tcl to compete with OLE/COM, OpenDoc, Fresco,
etc.

Your bring back NeWS parenthetical comment leads me to think that you

Rather than send this just to the browser developers I know I thought I'd 
share this with the public list.  This is what most developers would 
probably call "cake frosting", but I think it could actually represent a 
very powerful method of information discovery.  This proposal also 
doesn't ask for any changes in any protocols.

We're all set to add a dumb-intelligent-agent capability to our site, where
people can tell us on a section-by-section basis that they want to be
notified when new content is posted.  This notification would occur via
email, and would happen in batches twice a week so people weren't flooded
with lots of small bits of information.  However, as an implementor I find
this an ugly way to go about this - the mail traffic will be incredible and
the amount of processing power to deal with each person's unique filter is
really going to add up.  Instead, I'd like to provide a URL that people would
access on a regular basis which would tell them the same information - that
way we don't have to deal with bouncing mail or huge mail queues, etc.  In
fact we already have a URL like that, called "What's New" accessible from the
home page (this is customized to the user, since we know where a given user
has visited, but not personalized by section preferences yet). 

Anyways, it seemed to me that other sites have this kind of information flow
delimma - where the content exists at a common URL as a regular stream, and
where "add me to your hotlist and visit regularly" has to be said explicitly. 
Just watching my own browsing habits and those of others, regularly visiting
the same URL's is just not something people remember to do. 

It occurred to me that a more general solution to all this would be if
browsers implemented a cron-style auto-fetch functionality - where I could
say "fetch this URL every day at 3pm and let me know if it changes".  The
browser would present the fetched pages in a menu the same way a mail reader
presents mail messages.  I set my auto-fetch function to grab stock
quotes, the cover page of the SF Chronicle home page, and the Sherilyn Fenn
fanclub home page every night at 3am, and when I come into work that morning
I'll see a menu of that information the same way I sit down to the 50
messages on the WWW mailing lists.  Furthermore, I'll only get the Sherilyn
Fenn home page *when*it's*changed*, and if it gets a 302 Redirect it'll
change the URL without even telling me.  For those who don't leave their 
netscapes running at night, it can keep a record of the last job it
performed and at launch perform the rest up to the current time.

So in this case, instead of storing people's section preferences in a 
huge database on the server side, as we would be doing, the person would 
define their own preferences directly in their browser, and this 
functionality could be used on lots and lots of different sites.  (Yeah, 
I know our server doesn't do last-modifieds correctly, we'll fix that)

Furthermore, this could represent a model for mailing list distribution - 
instead of a monolithic mail server that executes 20 separate sendmail
procs to deliver 20 list emails to the same user, the user just hits the 
server when they actually read their mail.  The browser can send 
last-modified which would indicate the last time list messages were 
fetched, and the server would send just the email posted since then.
Say goodbye to mailing list headaches like bounced email, bogged down 
mail servers, etc etc!

I think functionality like this is what really will fulfill the promises 
of "intelligent agents", not autonomous programs flinging their way 
around the net.  But that's a different religious war altogether.

My quick repsonse would be - you could do this quite easily using a
line-mode browser.  I've been thinking of writing a script to do
this... it should be all that difficult.

I used to use emacs HTML mode until recently, when i had to discontinue 
it, for it's usage is restricted to HTML 1.0, and is particularly hostile 
towards new tags (e.g. to type <blink>, i have to type C-S-< blink C-S->).

Enough! Is anyone aware of an emacs mode supporting HTML 3.0 ? 

Thanx

Currently under development.  I'll prod the author to announce it here when
he's done.  You'll just have to keep on typing out <blink> by hand, I
suspect.  :)

For this reason I stopped using emacs HTML mode in a very early stage
and switched to emacs html-helper mode. This mode a.o. combines the
automatic insertion of html tags with the ability to maintain them
manually. Also it has great support for hilit19.
It uses the 'tempo' templates packages so it is easy to extend.

While one could implement this functionality quite easily today, I
think browsers will need to free themselves from the tyranny of the
mouse before we see real solutions. The current user interface
metaphors on our desktops demands user interaction in order to take
any action. While cron remains with us (and may have a glorious future
ahead) browsers have little concept of time and the age of
information. They hardly know anything about the importance and
preferred presentation of documents, Also, they don't have any idea of
what else your screen is filled with at 3pm. All this makes it hard to
create a decent solution that you would recommend beyond this mailing
list.

My attack angle towards these issues is style sheets. By hinting to
the browsers how information should be presented we can give browsers
a better basis for making presentational decisions. The style sheet
language should be able to address aspects other than the obvious
visual ones. In my style sheet proposal (available through
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/) on can e.g. attach
presentation parameters to the age of the document (I hope to have
this feature implemented in Arena soon). Allowing the user to specify
when certain information should be presented is an interesting
extension.

Hi,

Could anybody tell me how to make an include of an external document,
in a html document?

This is important because I want to have a similar look in all
my pages (the end could be all the same ...), and I want to have
this in a single document where I can change it when ever I want...

and just make includes of it in all the other documents...

 
I read somewhere that the NCSA server could make this with <inc srv ...>
tags... I have tried that but with no lucky, maybe because I use
the CERN httpd ... :-/

Any help would be apreciated, 
Tkank you

I've never had that problem, sinceI'm used to writing out the tags by 
hand. But if anyone suggests an emacs mode supporting HTML 3.0 I am sure 
I will check it out.

Re: cron-like feature built into www browsers.

I like the idea, but this could be seen as overloading the
browser.

A far more useful (IMO) approach, is one which I've seen dicsussed
on these "the future of computers" type TV shows -  one where you
have a program dedicated to doing this kind of slave robot work.

I'd be happier to have a separate system that I could tell to
fire up Netscape at 2am to go check on the weather forecast for
the day, or to run myapp to destroy all files that more than a week old
in my wastebasket.

All this could be possible with a user-fiendly interface to cron, with
no overloading of www clients.

But why not use a client-side-scriptable www client as that  
user-friendly interface (still not overloading the client with any  
special features)?

Being imbedded in hypertext documents, these programs could then be  
easily annotated and organized by the user, distributed by authors,  
endorsed by reviewers, etc.  Why should such programs be denied the  
benefits of being integrated into the World Wide Web?

Hello.

I'm pretty new to this game of writing www-pages and I have been using 
Netscape 1.0 as my main browser since I started writing.

I saw one of my "netscape-enhanced" www-pages on a Mosaic-browser today and 
got horrified! It didn't show my work as it was intended. 

My question is: Why does people use Mosaic when Netscape is better and 
can be obtained free all over the net?

Do you think that I should limit my layout so that mosaic-users can enjoy 
my pages as well? This would be a major setback for me because I really 
enjoy the new features in recent versions of HTML.

Hi there!

My impression is that most of the soundfiles available on www are of a 
very bad quality, probably to save time and space. This result in an 
almost unlistenable mess.

My opinion is that if you go below 8-bit, 22kHz, it's just not worth 
it. If you want to put your music out for public listening you'd probably 
want people to hear what it really sounds like and not some compressed blur.

I hope to hear some thoughts about if anyone really is interested in 
loading down sounds over www, and if so, how important is the sound quality.
Tips on useful datacompression for soundfiles would also be appreciated.

Thank you !

Don't get carried away! Netscape is not a free product at all.

"The Netscape Navigator 1.0N should be used according to the license
"agreement included with the program - it's free to academic and
"non-profit users and free for evaluation use by others. We encourage
"everyone to place an order for Netscape Navigator 1.0, the fully
"supported version of our product.

Moreover, it cannot be obtained "all over the net". The license
agreement explicitly prohibits copying and mirroring of the software.

It's really a matter of your intended audience. Who do you want
to be able to make use of your work?

We try to make sure things are viewable/readable when used with
Netscape/Mosaic on each of X Windows, MS Windows, Mac; plus text
browsers such as Lynx. Each of these environments has it's silly 
quirks but it's not all that hard.

An aquaintance recently had an emergency situation where she 
had to rework her html pages to avoid tickling a Windows Mosaic
bug. She'd been using Mosaic under X but the people who funded
her project were using Windows.

This doesn't help much but that's the situation today. Not
all browsers support blinking text and tables.

Does anyone have experience with using psgml?  This is reportedly an Emacs

use HTML-helper mode as well).  If the package works as advertised, one
should be able to use it to edit HTML 3 just by supplying the appropriate
DTD.

I've CCed the author; perhaps he can comment on the suitability of psgml for
editing HTML 3.

psgml is available from:

        We're all anxious to use the new HTML features.   But Reed's
right.   You need to be prepared to serve some  "lowest common denom-
inator"  browser specification.   Only you can decide how low you will
go.   I would urge you to support Mosaic because it's widely deployed.

You got what you asked for. If really want people to use a specific
application to view your work, you should use an application that
requires that application, and not one that happens to be
interoperable with others.

>My question is: Why does people use Mosaic when Netscape is better and
>can be obtained free all over the net?

Because NetScape isn't available for all platforms. Mosaic comes with
source, and can be compiled on pretty much any Unix platform without
killing yourself. I like 68K Unix boxes; NetScape doesn't run on any
of them, Mosaic runs on most of them.

Because NetScape is a pig - I quit running on it on my Linux box,
because it seemed to single-handled disable multitasking. Mosaic
doesn't (among other browsers) doesn't have that problem.

Because NetScape wasn't designed to be configurable, so lots of things
that are easy to change on other browsers are hard or impossible to
change on NetScape (Do you really trust layout elements from someone
who would put black text on a dark grey background :-).

Because NetScape doesn't integrate will with other tools. It tries
hard to be an all-purpose tool, which might be part of the problem.

Because NetScape does ugly page layout. It's about average for a
graphical browser, but it's still pretty ugly.

Because NetScape doesn't support enough of HTML3 for the puproses at
hand.

And finally, again, because NetScape isn't available for all
platforms. I've got clients using Charlotte & Albert. We're trying to
arrange things so they can get to lynx, as that would be an
improvement. Getting them to NetScape is a multi-million dollar
project, and not liable to happen in the near future.

I suspect that the features you're using that are causing problems
aren't "new features in recent versions of HTML", they are netscape
extensions that aren't HTML but only look like it. I suspect this
because, for the most part, the new features in HTML3 don't generate
the kinds of problems you described.

The answer depends on what you're trying to do. If you want to write
pages for the WWW, you should try arrange your pages so they are
presentable in most browsers. You can still put in NetScape
enhancements; it just takes some care and thought (one of my gripes
about NetScape the company is their lack of guidance in this area). If
you want to do things for a single application that's only available
on a few dozen platforms, you can do that as well. I'd really
recommend going to an application that lets you do good page design,
and providing a few web pages with instructions on how to obtain
viewers & configre browsers to start them. That way, you know that
everyone who looks at your pages will see what you intended, and not
be doing silly things like pumping them through a speech synth or to a
braille terminal.

I don't see the conflict - an object model is independent of the
language used to implement it.
OLE/COM, OpenDoc etc have object models and then they have language
bindings.  The two are in different semantic domains and comparing them
or suggesting that they compete is comparing apples and oranges.

The author of the original statement was right on. Designing an object
model requires thinking through a number of modelling issues which
are language independent .  By focusing on safe-tcl as the vehicle of 
agent technology some of the precursor issues - object model being one 
of them - are being ignored.

What are the objects in an agent framework ?
What actions do they perform ?
On behalf of whom do they perform them ?

- these are the kinds of questions involved in an object model.

What has safe-tcl got to do with this except being one of the languages
in which an object model is implemented ?

I agree with the original poster that an object model is required
before all this agent stuff will begin to make sense in an
implementation independent way.

  I've been using psgml for HTLM 2.0 and 3.0 editing for at least 8 or 9

I still use Mosaic because I find it far less 
eyestrain-inducing than Netscape.  The main reason
for this is that Mosaic is more configurable, and I've
set it up to use fonts and background colors that I like.
(It's still far from perfect -- Arena's layout is 
infinitely better -- but at least I'm not stuck with 
Netscape's black-on-dark-grey all-Times-Roman text
with way too much vertical whitespace.)  So even though 
Netscape is better for casual surfing, if I'm going to 
spend any time actually reading and not just browsing,
I usually stick with Mosaic.

Another advantage is that Mosaic *doesn't* support
certain extensions -- primarily background images,
inline font-size changes, and gratuitous centering -- 
that are badly overused by the half-competent wanna-be 
graphic designers who are beginning to overrun the Web.
(Not that these features are bad in and of themselves,
just that they are more often than not badly used.
Some pages are so overdone that they are unreadable
under anything but Lynx, and then you have to deal with 
the [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] effect.)

That's totally up to you.

I used to believe that layout should be the browsers'
job and that authors should concentrate on content
and organization.  The Web seems to be evolving in
a much different direction, though.

| From: Jose Pina Miranda  <pinj@di.uminho.pt>

|  In the WWW National Conference (URL http://www.di.uminho.pt/cnw3.html )
| we want to offer a CD-ROM to all the participants.
| The CD-ROM will have, among other useful informations, some WWW pages from
| all around the World to show people, without Internet connection, how 
the Web
| looks like.
Sounds liek a wonderful idea.

| 1- I read 2 or 3 months ago about a tool that let you get an hierarchy of
| 	URL's. Someone knows where I can get it ?
You want a web spider or web crawler, follow the links from www.w3.org on their
software products page. [ this is from an obscure bit of grey matter :-]

| 2- Somebody tried before to make a CD-ROM with WWW pages ?
|     We have a problem with the pages that have complete URL path. Let me
|     explain it better :
|         Suppose you're looking to a page, stored in the CD-ROM.
| 	You follow a link whose URL is http://xxx.org/zzz/aaa.html . You know
| 	that the page with the URL choosen is stored in the CD-ROM. But how
| 	does Mosaic (or Netscape, ...) knows that ? It doesn't !! It only
| 	tries to follow the link ...
|
| 	Any hints about possible solutions ? (Note that we want to access
| 	the pages in the CD-ROM from different environments - Windows, Linux,
| 	Unix, Windows NT and MacIntosh). We have thought in two possible
| 	solutions:
| 	    a) change Mosaic code, in such a way that Mosaic knows where
| 		each URL is in the CD-ROM (it could be done with a MD5
| 		hash algorithm)
| 	     b) pre-processing of all WWW pages that we put in the CD-ROM,
| 		in such a way that all the links have a "file" URL
| 			(URL file:... )
This is probably the best, because it will work with almost any viewer 
on almost any platform.

|      Other possible solutions ?
To include a caching web server on the cdrom, with the various files in 
the correct
place to spoof the caching algorithm.
This has the distinct advantage that everybody now has a http server so 
they can
continue to play with the web in their own private play pen :-)
Perhaps with this in mind you should make sure the cached pages include good
introductory HTML and http pages as well as specifications.
ie basically deliver people enough to set up their own web.
The serious problems with this approach are finding caching http's for 
all platforms,
and fitting all of them and everything else you want on the cdrom.

   Hi there!

   My opinion is that if you go below 8-bit, 22kHz, it's just not worth 
   it. If you want to put your music out for public listening you'd probably 
   want people to hear what it really sounds like and not some compressed blur.

It depends what you're trying to accomplish.  For simple voice samples
(without musical accompaniment), 8-bit ulaw is perfectly intelligible
(not great, but it does the job).

   I hope to hear some thoughts about if anyone really is interested in 
   loading down sounds over www, and if so, how important is the sound quality.
   Tips on useful datacompression for soundfiles would also be appreciated.

You might want to look into audio MPEG, which offers near-CD quality
reproduction from files which are comparable in size to .au samples.
The IUMA crowd uses this format heavily; you might look at their
"how-to" pages to see what players are available on your platform.

I'm only familiar with NCSA-HTTPD server-side includes, and I'm not sure if
the CERN server supports them.

You may want to look at the CERN HTTPD 3.0 Guide at
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Guide.html>.

In any case, the include statement in an HTML file to include a file is as
follows:

<!--#include file="[filename]"-->

Hi all,

A few people here have asked me to do a bit of digging into what type of
machine/server we should get. As most of you will probably know Im
biased towards serving with NCSA on a Sun and cacheing with CERN on
another Sun.  So in an attempt to be a bit more balanced before I wander
off and spout off, here is the fundamental question ;)

There is going to be a new server set up, with a choice of machine and 
software to run on it. The initial suggestion is a P90 running Solaris 2.4.
This can obviously run either CERN or NCSA based servers (my leaning
here would be towards NCSA since we dont need it to cache, however there
is a minor problem with the expected load - more on that in a minute!).

However there are one or two other possibilities. We have some RISC iX
machines (Acorn Archimedes 440/540's) which quite happily run the NCSA
server and when running X11 can quite easily cope with 120+ requests/hour.
This is on a 12Mb machine with around 12Mb swap.

Another possibility as I see it is to not bother with a new machine, and
use some form of dynamic IP addressing and spread the service over a
number of machines that we already have.

BTW, I should add that things like Linux and FreeBSD are apparently out
since the people having to run the server want a "commercially
supported" OS on the machine.

Then that brings the question of the server to run. Like most of you
will know I can pretty well handle the CERN and NCSA servers BUT it wont
be my job to do so *phew*. Thus I feel that the NCSA server is a tad
easier to use and that is the way to go. What about servers like say
Plexus?

There is also the possibility that there may be some sensitive/secure
information that needs to be served. Are the current free servers up to
this or does that mean then that we need to go commercial (Im thinking
of the Netscape server here).

Suggestions and comments on my reasonings would be appreciated. Im not
after any holy war stuff here, just a few comments. :)

Cheers,

Paul

I've used Netscape from time to time. This would have made me turn up
in logs as a Netscape user. I wouldn't want anybody to use these log
entries as justification for the above quote.

Only for educational use, last time I looked.

Netscape employs a number of non-standard markup tags.  They are not html,
they just look like html.   Netscape on my 486DX33 with 8Mb Ram has, at the
very best, a 66% hit rate.  That is to say that 1 out of every three (this
is a minimum) pages that I ask for returns a server error - mostly that the
server does not understand my browser's request.  This hit rate deteriorates
as the cache fills up, which appears to happen pretty quickly.

Netscape is flaky.  I know this because I also use lynx.  Every failed
request in Netscape is cut and pasted (for speed but it means I don't
mistype) into lynx which returns a 100% hit rate except for those requests
where the server itself is down.

I hope one day to see a graphical browser as fast and efficient as lynx but
I begin to despair.  Perhaps graphical surfing will always be a hit and
miss affair.  I have used Netscape on a PowerPC and another, slightly
higher spec PC than my own.  It is better on the Mac (PowerPC) but it is
still not very good.

I think you should go to the w3o or ncsa and get a copy of the latest html
specification (2 - which includes forms support) and stick to it.  Most
browsers will ignore markup they do not understand but groups like Netscape
will eventually produce something that lynx (for example) has a big problem
with.

If you think your pages look different in Mosaic then fasten your seat belt
and have a look via lynx - fast, efficient, reliable but *no* pretty
pictures, fonts, buttons ...

Don't the new betas of Mosaic and Netscape offer the CLI for this exact
purpose?

	Let's look at why HTML has been so popular. Hyperlinks, of course, 
are the primary reason. But the fact that all tags not understood by 
browser are silently ignored has also contributed a lot. In short, 
there's absolutely nothing wrong with using a <blink> tag 'coz it's sheer 
value addition -- if a browser doesn't understand it, it will ignore it. 
Hence it doesn't hurt in any respect -- be it valid or not!

Hi there!


I have a quicktime movie, generated in a Mac, which I wanna put on a WWW 
server. I ran into two problems, both of which can be of newbie type.

1. How do I save quicktime movie in a generic format, without the mac data/fork 
format, so that it can be displayed on any computer platform??

2. Which helper app can I use on a Mac and on a PC to display quicktime movies? 
I tried both Fast player and the Apple quicktime viewer on a Mac without 
success...

Best regards,

The Futplex system is a software package that provides documents with
read/write access on the World Wide Web.

A Futplex document consists of pages with text and hypertext links.
Pages can be created, changed, and added to interactively, using a
standard WWW client.

All changes and additions are visible immediately to all users.  Thus a
Futplex document is not just a place for storing information; it is also a
medium for direct communication among its users.  The Futplex features
include facilities for quickly finding new and changed information in the
document.

More information, including a publicly accessible demo system, can be
found on the Futplex system home page:

 http://gewis.win.tue.nl/applications/futplex/

Futplex version 4.0 is free software.  It is available for ftp at
gewis.win.tue.nl in /pub/futplex.  Version 4.0 is the first public release.

I have a CGI perl script that queries a file (via egrep)
to build a dynamic distribution list.

When the results come back, they are piped after a
<TEXTAREA> tag.  This works OK, unless I pipe a large
(> 100KB) amount of data back.  In that case, the
TEXTAREA box only contains a portion of the output).

I also tried just piping the output back to the
dynamically-created HTML page.  In that case, I *do*
get see all the data.

Is there some kind of hard limit to how large a
TEXTAREA can be?  If so, is there a better way to build
a user-editable list?  Thanks for any help.

  There is nothing in the spec that inherently limits the amount of data
that can be in a textarea.  This is a browser dependent issue.  What
browser are you using?  If its in 16 bit windows, you might be running into
the 64K chunk limit.

If you take a close look at Java, you'll realize that it bears a close
similarity to Viola, since the "applets" must be coded from a predefined
language, downloaded and locally interpreted.  Of course this is another
"monolithic" approach (notice that java takes up 10MB of RAM and about 12 of
disk) that assumes that one can create a single language that all
applications can be crafted from.  API's, (such as the Eolas Weblet(TM)
technology, http://www.eolas.com) that allow "applets" to be created using
the most appropriate tools and then embedded in binary form within Web
pages, are much more flexible and powerful.

Two things: 
A Turing complete language does allow you to create 'all applications.
Execution times and elegance of implementation may vary according to
what problems the language aims at solving.  

How does the user get a weblet in the first place?  I need a binary
that my browser will launch, if I understand the scanty documentation on
your server.  Also, how the CCI++ protocol will handle inline browser 
animation (for example) doesn't seem very clear.

To me it looks like   Java + scripts  == Eolas + n helper apps

If you had taken a closer look yourself, before launching into the  
predictable Eolas marketing message, you might have noticed that:

* Java applets are tranported as bytecode, not interpreted script.
* The Java bytecode spec will be published, so compilers for
	other languages can be written.
* The HTML imbedding scheme used by HotJava is not language-specific;
	MIME typing can be used to resolve the applet format.

All in all, I'd say Sun shows an excellent understanding of open  
software.  Should your Eolas site ever provide actual information,  
and not just grandiose marketing slogans like "Web Technologies for  
the Next Millennium", I will be happy to re-evaluate your offerings.

Suprise!

Because many people are unable to run it on their machines (such as me). And 
others are unable to read Netscapes small text on a dark grey background
(also me).

The question you should ask yourself is why do people use Netscape when Arena
offers far superior layout, including maths and has done for a considerable
time?

|>Do you think that I should limit my layout so that mosaic-users can enjoy

It depends what the purpose of the layout is. If you have some idea of
pretty layout then the world can probably survive without it. If the features
are essential to the message you want to convey, such as tables or maths then
using extensions is probably worthwhile.

If you want to have a large degree of control over layout without irritating
people who don't share your views on typography than have a look at the new
release of Arena with style sheets.


The question is whether browser companies are going to head off in the direction
of easy to implement or easy to use. Stylesheets, maths and tables are harder
to implement than background images and centered blinking text. Presentation
based layout is easier to define than structural but tends to date very 
quickly.

We rejected this technique for two reasons:
 1. Portability.  If you use "the most appropriate tools" this probably
    means your favorite C (or whatever) compiler.  These almost always
    generate machine code, which will only run on the platform it was
    compiled for.  There are many different CPU architectures on the net.
    Java uses a bytecode that is machine independent that can either be
    interpreted or compiled on-the-fly in the destination machine (the
    current release only interprets).
 2. Safety.  One of the things about the intermediate code that Java uses
    is that we can do a lot of analysis to check that the code fragment is
    safe to use and isn't going to do something wild like overwrite memory
    or remove random files.  There are several documents on security in the
    release that you should take a look at (they're pointed to from the
    "documentation" entry of the "help" menu).

I don't know where you got the 10Mb number - the instance of the browser
running on my machine right now is using 4.7Mb.

It's actually in the release.  It's also in
	http://java.sun.com/1.0alpha2/doc/vmspec/vmspec_1.html
The documentation guide is in:
	http://java.sun.com/1.0alpha2/doc/index.html
If you get the HotJava release, all this hangs off the
"documentation" entry of the "Help" menu.

Before you get TOO excited, you should note that, at least for the
moment, Java is somewhat *less* available than Dylan, and for fewer
platforms. However, as it looks like Sun is putting considerable
development effort into it, that will likely change soon. 

Is source code going to be freely available for the interpreter ?

How secure is Sun's support considering they are also investing 
development resources in Tcl ? ( The argument from some of the
safe-tcl boosters re: agentware has been that we can only have 
ONE Universal Network/Distributed-App/Agent Programming Language.
Now, Sun now has two! )

>From what I was able to see before I was unable to connect any
more ( What - is everybody on this list reading the Java Web Docs? )
it looks quite interesting :  Better than either C++ or Tcl. 
( I wouldn't describe it as "all we hoped for from Dylan" , but
maybe my hopes were higher :-) 

Definitely worth watching - I'm just trying to watch critically - 
no offense intended Simon - I would not have known you had had 
any connection with Sun except for the disclaimer at the top - 
but there has been a bit of hype for Java ( nee Oak ) in some

>Two things: A Turing complete language does allow you to create 'all

Well, Turing's not around anymore, and I, for one, and I'd rather not hold
my breath waiting for Sun to try to get Java to become all things to all people.

My point was just that there are many types of applications that Java can't
handle or for which it isn't the optimal solution.  I'm not trying to put
Java down.  I think that it is may represent the best kind of solution for
handling GUI elements in embedded apps, for example.  APIs, on the other
hand, are good practical solutions for high-performance embedded apps now.

That comment is out of line.  Is your problem with the MetaMAP technology,
or with the fact that software patents exist?  The MetaMAP approach allowed
me to implement interactive hypermedia in the form of 8-bit paletted
"imagemaps" on a 256K PC even before the first copy of Hypercard was
available for the Mac.  The fact that it is a particularly effective
solution for Web-based imagemaps does not diminish the validity of the
patent.  If you just don't like the idea that innovative and useful software
technology should be protectable under U.S. patent law, then all I can say
is: grow up.

Unfortunately, grandiose marketing slogans are far easier to write than good
technical documentation.  The docs will be fleshed out more in the near
future.  Please don't write us off just because we're trying to build a new
business.  Sun had  roughly 20 people working on Java.  We're still only a
very small start up.  The Weblet work visible to date was done by 3 people.
We're in the process of growing, so we'll be able to respond more quickly soon.

If you check our site out in mid-April, you'll be able to download our
enhanced version of XMosaic (Sun, SGI and Linux binaries, possibly source
too) with Weblet and MetaMAP support, as well as sample Weblets with source
code.  Please give it a fair examination before passing judgement.

Ok. What is *required* is an architecture. 
( What I said in an earlier message - I then made the arguable assumption 
that "The Architecture" would be an Object Oriented one. )

Having a layered architecture has been one of the things that has
enabled the internet to grow and evolve, even though most of the
technologies it was originally built upon are now obsolete ( or
rapidly growing so ) [ I don't think you can claim that programming
language design is a mature art, or that tcl is the last word in
that art! ]

I don't want to stop ANY progress. 
However, since there are already a dozen or more incompatible
research or commercial ventures into the distributed agents 
language niche, I think it would be worth spending a bit of
time thinking about whether there is a posibility of some sort
of common architecture. ( Wouldn't you consider interoperability 
to be some sort of progress ? Besides - we were discussing mostly
capabilities that aren't yet part of the enabled mail version
of Safe-Tcl. I understand that several groups are working on
various safe-Tcl extensions. Don't they need some standardization,
at least within the Tcl world to work ? Or are you talking about
"stopping progress" until John Ousterhout looks at all of the
different version and "blesses" one of them as standard ? ;-) 

> Foolishness.
> 	/r$


However, I've recently been informed on www-talk that all this
discussion is moot, as Java has already won. ;-)

Despite statements from people at Sun that the two languages are
not in competition with each other, they clearly are. 

IF there can only be a Single Universal Network/Distributed/Agent
language, THEN it can't be both Java and Tcl ( and/or others )

IF there is room for more than one language, THEN there is a
need for *some* sort of interoperability plan. 

Java suggests *A* plan: compile other languages into Java Virtual
Machine bytecode. ( I'm not sure that it's the best plan, but 
it's a plan. I haven't yet read enough of the VM spec. or the Class
Library to judge. )

Could anyone PLEASE tell me how to get sounds out of a web page? I have been
trying with no success. Some things that would help would be:
1. A place to get a player that would play sounds (something as universal as
possible)I am using netscape.

2. The way to write the code. I've seen it written, but I must be missing
something, because I can't even get it to work on my own computer, much less
live when I put it up on my site!
ANY help would be MOST appreciated!!

You will have to "flatten" the movie into one file. This can be done very 
easily with an app called FlattenMooV, found on the info-mac archives. 
For your nearest link, try ftp.sunet.se.

The file won't display correctly (or more accurately, not at all) when 
transferred in it's present state. You *have* to flatten it first. Then I 
guess you should be able to view it using any viewer on the Mac and using 
a QT compatible viewer on the PC.

And the validity of the patent makes it completely
unsuitable for Web-based imagemaps:  this technology 
has zero chance of being selected for standardization 
by the IETF or W3O because of the patent.

And that's too bad; MetaMAP is a neat idea.  Fortunately there's
still quadtrees and fully-discretized quadtrees, which have similar
performance characteristics and space requirements and are
(as far as I know) not patented.

I've skimmed your web page but didn't find much clarification, so let 
me apologize in advance if I've misinterpreted the last, but...

Others have mentioned the safety issue, but let me put it a little more 
strongly.  I will NEVER EVER run a browser that depends on (no, is 
willing to) executing binaries downloaded from a server, at least on 
any currently extant hardware architecture.  Nor will I trust a machine 
where somebody has.

Having said that, I'm not clear on the point of binaries.  They are 
more efficient, but often marginally so.  In reality they are just a 
different predefined language, but one that is defined by the hardware 
so that if I own a machine that the server provider didn't have a copy 
of I'm out of luck.  With Safe-TCL or Python (and maybe even HotJava, 
although that depends on Sun to some extent) I have a solution, at 
least in principle.

Anyway, for modern computers (anything with more than 8 bits), the naive  
linear search through the list of rectangles is more than fast enough for 
image map purposes.  If it's big enough to run IP, you don't need to do 
anything.

Of course, if I can persuade some grad students to do the web browser for 
pixelflow, quadtrees and the like will be more useful... Well add a 
dimension, but you know what I mean :-)

I am looking for any titles of books on the ethical/impact/productive 
use/etc. of the Information Superhighway or Internet. Most books 
describe a hands on use of the Internet with very few on the above 
mentioned subjects. So far I could only find the book "Straight talk 
about the Information Superhighway" by Reid Goldsborough (1994, Alpha 
Books). Is there anyone out there that knows of relevant/related 
titles....?

Thanks
Pieter

Arena now supports all characters in the symbol fonts. Try pointing it
to http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Arena/tour/symbols.html

For information on how to get Arena, see

Hey there, thank you for the response regarding my question. I have another,
if anyone knows theanswer...
        While it is easy to find ALOT of utilities programs that will play
wav files, edit wav files, convert other formats into wav files, I see to be
having very litle luck finding a utility that will convert wav (and others)
INTO an au or an aiff format. Any pointers?

Since so far (according to their Web page), only those with Sun's

Hi all,
        I discovered an interesting artifact of turning on server-side
includes in NCSA's httpd 1.3R: it seems to inhibit the sending of both the
Last-modified and the Content-length headers. I never saw this documented,
so it took me a while to figure out why I wasn't seeing these headers from
our server! Is this a known feature? Is there a planned fix for it in 1.4?
TIA!

(Yes, I realize that providing accurate information for these fields while
including files is difficult. However, not having a Last-modified field
basically prevents our pages from being cached anywhere -- a big minus
IMHO.)

This approach is similar to that suggested for backward compatibility in the
file upload internet draft.  Please see:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-fileupload-01.txt

A sample implementation for Mosaic for X can be found at:

ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/fileup/

Helper applications for file upload, for backward compatibility, will also be
found there sometime in the future, but you should be able to develop your own
if you need them soon.

Why embedded?  No, seriously - do we really need embedded apps?  Am I 
the only one who thinks that launching xv to view external images is
a Good Thing ?  Forcing xv to do its work through Mosaic or Netscape
would seem to be a roundabout way of doing things, to say the least.

In order to handle multiple files or a continuous data stream, 
what is basically needed then is a mechanism for handing an external viewer
the open connection, instead of handing it the resulting file.
viz. the new Netscape 'inefficiently animated icons' hack.

Of course, this means that the client can start handing off all sorts
of connections, not just HTTP connects, but FTP, Gopher things, some
new session based protocol communicating with a rendering engine or a
proprietary protocol for playing Blackjack with other clients logged
in to the same server.

Do these apps really need to be inlined into the browser? No.  Do they
need to communicate with the browser? Yes - CCI is a step in the right
direction, although I keep thinking that a better operating system
would make this a non-problem (Consider the paradigm 'web application
as scriptable OpenDoc part' or even just a web browser built out of
SOM objects).  Trying to graft IPC on top of systems that really
weren't built for it seems to be ... an exercise in frustration.

>>To me it looks like   Java + scripts  == Eolas + n helper apps
>Not even close.

What's the big payoff that Java is missing? Direct interaction with
server side apps/renderers ?  Maybe we should look into the
possibility of Java and CCI++ coexistence.  Java seems to suit local
rendering needs quite well (image maps, simple animations, UI tweaks),
while CCI++ appears to handle the larger issue of 'not all client-server
interaction is stateless HTTP', hence they seem more complimentary than
competitive.  Of course either one could be used to do tasks the other is
better suited to, but the same can be said for Perl and C++.

Using CCI to hook up to a big rendering engine seems to be a good idea -
controlling the inline image using Java might be a possible alternative to 
writing an external renderer (if you want to go for embedded interfaces).

Using CCI to hook up to a simple animation engine is a waste of bandwidth.
(Once you have sent the first n frames of animation, there is no need to send
them again.)

Both have a place. For example, what if I really want to have inlined
MPEG? By providing a generalised linking mechanism to allow both, we
allow maximum flexibility.

If people want inlined images, they can have them, why not apps? Both
are just objects after all. Eventually it might be nice to be able to
inline blocks of text too, and the only sensible way to do it is to
have the embedded document be an object: #include like mechanisms lead
down a long and twisty road to say the least.

All these things are moving the same way: allow arbitrary objects to
be composed to form a single application (in WWW terms, browser + page
combination). That is the future, and it will have profound effects on
both users, and the software business model. I would say for the
better.

Hi,

      Can anyone point me in the right direction? I am trying to execute 
a DOS batch file on my local computer. (I'm trying to learn forms) I have 
the following:

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="file:///d:/wwwfiles/pl.bat">

However, the contents of the pl.bat is displayed. Is there a way to have 
the batch file execute and the output display as my browser's desktop.

     Thanks for your help.

---- Begin Forwarded Message

Today (3/30/95) I received a copy of an e-mail from Hughes Aircraft
Company via Moorpark College and the City of Ventura regarding a new 
virus
called GOOD TIMES that originated from someone on AOL.

This virus, when activated, is extremely destructive and, the e-mail
states, "is unparalled in its capability...other more well-known viruses
such as Stoned, Airwolf and Michaelangelo pale in comparison..."

The virus can be detected as an e-mail message with the subject line
reading "Good Times."  If you receive a piece of e-mail with Good Times 
as
the subject, DO NOT READ IT...DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY.

The virus is launched when the e-mail is loaded into the mail server's
ASCII buffer and it is highly intelligent...it will send copies of 
itself
to everyone whose e-mail addess is contained in the received-mail file 
or
sent-mail file, if it can find one.  Once a computer is infected, one of
several things can happen.  The hard drive will most likely be 
destroyed. 
If the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed 
in
an nth-complexity infinite binary loop which can severly damage the
processor.

REMEMBER...if you receive a piece of e-mail with the subject called Good
Times, DO NOT READ IT...DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY.

Something that might be interesting to take a look at is Pesto:
	http://www.faslab.com/fresco/Futurism.html#Python
from which I quote:

"
Python 

Pesto is cooking! Pesto is a Python interface to the CORBA dynamic
invocation interface, and thus Fresco. A Pesto prototype is running and is
currently being packaged up for inclusion in the snapshot. 
"

A browser based on this might be something quite impressive.

I strongly doubt that.  (And see below for stronger opinion.)

Viruses are instructions that need something to execute them.  (Biological 
viruses effectively are chemical instructions that need the chemical environ-
ment of a cell to execute them; computer viruses are instructions in some 
form (e.g., hardware instructions, shell commands, mailer control file 
commands) that need some agent (e.g., hardware, shell, mailer program) to 
execute them.)

There have been mail viruses (or were they worms?), but as far as I know they 
are executed by the software that moves mail around, not by the end-users mail
reader.

(For example, here's a virus:

"Send a copy of this sentence to someone else."

It is instructions to you, the human reader.  If you follow the instructions,
it propagates; if you don't, it doesn't; if you ignore it and delete it, it 
dies.

Obviously, this virus isn't very effective, because humans usually will 
choose not to follow the instructions.  But it is a virus.

Hey!  I just realized---THE FORWARDED RUMOR IS A VIRUS!  (It doesn't 
explicitly contain instructions to forward it, but it's written knowing that 
people repeat rumors, so that's an implicit instruction to forward it.
Therefore, it is a virus.)

But I, one valiant little antibody in the Internet immune system, have 
recognized the invader, and have mutated it, hopefully sentencing it to
death.

(Now if only someone could do something about those (ex-?) lawyers who keep
spamming the Internet...)

THIS IS 100% BULLSHIT!  Infinite loops don't damage CPUs.  And infinite
loops are infinite loops; there's no such thing as "an nth-complexity 
infinite binary loop."

If readers don't believe me yet, then consider this:  The warning doesn't 
say anything about which kind(s) of computer the virus infects.  Because 
viruses are instructions, they can only infect hardware or software that
understands and executes that type of instructions.  The only thing machines
have to have in common to exchange mail is they they understand and process 
mail formats.  Therefore, any mail virus must be composed of instructions
in mail-exchange protocols, and those protocols aren't powerful enough to 
express the instructions needed to erase a disk (maybe fill it up with junk,
but not erase it).

So...

Why did this bogus rumor start?
- Someone naive misunderstood something, including maybe a joke?
- Some idiot decided to start a rumor?
- Someone is trying to prevent someone else's message from being read?

Why is Fell_Travis (dal11_tjfell@dal.mobil.com) passing it along?
- He (or she?) didn't know that it was bullshit, and was innocently passing
	along a warning?
- He is an accomplice?

The capabilities of this virus are impossible.  You are either someone
not very knowledgeable with computers (in which case, I hold nothing
against you) or you are an asshole trying to get people to believe
a meaningless scare.

In either case, I'm willing to bet you are or will be getting a lot of
flames.  For all I know, thats what you want...

Still, please don't send messages w/o evidence like this again...

Talk about hysteria!  A few points:

1. I assume this virus does its business on PCs, although that was never
   explicitly mentioned.  Just another reason to avoid them....

2. Isn't this the same "virus" that was talked about late last year?  This
   hot news is a little stale.

3. What self-respecting virus would announce its presence in the subject
   line of an email?

4. What is "an nth-complexity infinite binary loop"?  Sounds like something
   that my sainted grandmother might be impressed by, but are you going to
   fall for such mumbo-jumbo?  And, just how does it "severly [sic] damage
   the processor."?  Perhaps it melts into a pool of silicon when confronted
   by the awesome intelligence of this virus.

On a more serious note, this sort of hysteria, coupled with the non-thinking
and untimely dissemination of same, creates the popular impression that the
net is an evil place, populated with hobgoblins and bogey men of the worst
kind.  IMHO, the real problem lies in the reaction of the messengers.

BTW, what was this note doing on this list?

Just wait.  It's going to get much worse before it gets any better.
The Internet has, until now, been the haunt mainly of academics, re-
search groups, and bright young university students.

Notice how many of the nutty postings come from .com, .aol, etc. ad-
dresses....

Let's stop this right NOW! You cannot get a virus from an e-mail message, 
only from executables (eg, programs and applications). GOOD TIMES has 
already been dismissed as a hoazx months ago.

Those with a sense of humor might want to send lots of mail, all carrying
the subject line "Good Times", to anyone who posts this warning... 

How long will it be before this rumor gets embellished to the point where
the virus can destroy systems to which it is addressed, EVEN BEFORE IT IS
SENT?

Hey, wait a minute!  About which ".com" addresses are you talking?  :-)
Don't group <technical company>.com addresses with aol.com, netcom.com, etc.

er...uh..excuse me????

A huge percentage of the .com hierarchy are commercial hardware and/or
software development organizations in the world...While some
commercial service providers have .com addresses, there are thousands
or hundreds of thousands of engineers, scientists, system
administrators etc, etc who post from these accounts...I would hate to
see a couple of dingy posts make anyone think that those posting from
this type of account are less than credible, it just aint so...

Thanks for the paper - I think you covered a lot of the pros and 
cons. However, I'ld like to offer a different perspective on the 
"Why mobile agents?" question raised in your paper -- 

Why NOT mobile agents ? 

The number one argument against their use seems to be security. 

However, people frequently download code from the network right now - 
often binaries for DOS and Mac clients, sometimes Unix binaries, but
more often sources. But even when sources are compiled and build locally,
how often does anyone actually READ the code looking for dangerous 
virus like behaviour ? 

In fact, most people rely on trusting code they get from a "trusted 
source". 

Current practice is, in fact, insecure, and is only going to grow
more insecure as use of networked services grow. An informal network
of "trusted sources" is only viable in a relatively small networked
community.  

So, I would argue that the type of safety required for mobile agent
programming languages is going to be a general requirement for networked
applications on public nets, whether or not they are actually used to
program mobile agents. 


I believe that such protections *ought* to be a part of the operating
system, but we don't currently have that kind of OS support, so we need
to build it into a programming language system. ( For a history of 
some attempts to build that sort of  support into Operating Systems, see
Henry M. Levy's "Capability-Based Computer Systems", Digital Press 1984) 


If my argument is correct - that there is going to be a ubiquitous 
requirement for such "safe" programming languages, then the primary
argument against mobile agent programming disappears. 


I do agree that there are many cases where RPCs or Distributed Objects
are a more appropriate technology - which is why I have also argued 
for building an architecture where they can all interoperate and you
can mix and match techniques. 


As an example, I would mention that adding a the capabilities 
for a restricted execution environment to the Python interpreter
started (at least with me) not with the intention of programming
remote agents, but with supporting distributed and cooperative
development of the Python class library. I was looking for a way
to use the WWWeb to help maintain and expand the library, and 
eliminate the bottleneck of having a single "keeper" of the official
and "blessed" Library modules. Discussion of how to implement a 
safe, distributed remote module import in the interpreter, showed
that the same mechanism could enable a number of other distributed
applications, including remote server agents and downloadable client
scripts.  Which also resurrected an old idea that I had put off as
not practical at the time: object-oriented files, where data have 
attached methods to, for example, display or decompress themselves.
This is exactly the same problem, except files replace the network
as the medium of distribution. 
I would note that in a discussion on the html-wg mailing list, there
was a mention of the ISO work on the MHEG multi-media standards, which
appears to include plans for attaching scripts to multi-media objects. 


[ I *won't* CC this to the html-wg list, as it's not related to HTML, 
  but I will CC this to www-talk, where some discussion of Sun's Java 
  and other client-side agents has been popping up. ] 
  

I believe there is a converging need for these "safe scripts",
that such safe programming systems are possible and desirable, 
whether or not you want mobile agents. But that once you have that
capability, the primary objection to mobile agents disappears.

rf,

I couldn't agree more. I know some very high-level people who use <gulp> Prodigy
and the like for various reasons, such as the access # is a local call. Please 
don't condemn us .com folks.

****  1st  April  *****  1st  April  ****  1st  April  ****

The mail with the subject "GOOD TIMES" does not contain the virus, ...

... it is the mail with the subject:
"INTERNET VIRUS ALERT"

It works in this way, that, if the three words in this sequence comes 
into the mailsystem, the program sendmail is sensitive against this 
words and activate its defence. Unfortunately the programmer of 
sendmail let it open what exactly should be done, so some students 
from Berkerly "corrected" it. The virus is not in the mail, just the 
trigger for it. And it does not matter if you read the message or not,

Hello, 

Is it still April 1 in the United States?  
INTERNET VIRUS ALERT is really enjoyable (^^), and it's time 
to go back to www-talking.

March 31 is already over anywhere, and some of we need to 
re-download newer version of Netscape, to be expired June 30, 
and need to go to the "user anonymous access denied" jams.  

I don't understand why we have to update Netscape too often. 
Is there a necessity to do so? 
(But I love Netscape because it supports Japanese character 
 encodings originally. NCSA Mosaic is nearly useless to 
 browse Japanese sites.)  

Does anyone know if we have a better hope??  
Any pointer (not poison) is appreciated. 

regards, 

Hiroshi MURATA.

I think that's slightly wrong.  The IETF (and W3O?) can standardize
patented technology, provided anyone can license the technology under
"reasonable" terms.  That said, folks often prefer public domain
technology over licensed technology exactly because they have a freer
hand with it.

This has been asked before, and the answer is no.

I've now put a second HTTP-NG checkpoint up on the web; it's still pretty 
rough, but I've added a lot of new text (now that I have my own 
DragonDictate, it's a lot easier to get things done...)

Why don't they use a larger font, then? It _can_ be set to different 
fonts and sizes.

When can we expect to find a usable version of Arena? A version that requires a
zillion parameters on the command line is rather annyoing to use. AND it would be
nice to either have preferences-option inside the program, or a settings-file. (I
didn't say I didn't like Arena - I do. But there are a couple of features I miss
from Netscape)

I'd like to second this thought about subjects in mailto URLs.

I run a number of mailing lists using Procmail/Smartmail and it would
be really useful to be able to add "subscribe" and "unsubscribe"
buttons to a HyperMail archive page for these lists.

Could the QUERY_STRING be used in mailto such that the url would 
look something like:

      mailto:list-request@machine.com?subscribe

Is there a MIME Content-Type for files following the General MIDI standard?
It seems to me there ought to be.  Any comments?

I just released a program, doing something like this. It is not integrated into
a browserm rather it is a separate client. You can specify the URLs in an HTML
document (Netscape will do this for you), feed the document into the program,
give a date after which you consider the URL to be new and the program will
generate an HTML documents with the updated URLs (overnight if you wish.) It is
not the 'mail' paradigm, more like the Web (html) paradigm - you get a
document which
you can feed into your browser.

        Good idea,  Brian.   And good responses ... "yeah,  what he said".

        I wrote a not-fully-featured line-mode tool to help with
stuff like this.   I say,  cron it.   Signal the browser?   Maybe.
Obviously you'd *have* to signal the browser sometime ... somehow ...
in some cases.   But it makes sense (for now) to have an agent that
builds, say, HTML of  "things that have changed".

 ...
>Fenn home page *when*it's*changed*, and if it gets a 302 Redirect it'll

        That's a nice touch.   Yes,  that helps.   Suggests that I
should add redirection info as an optional second stream from 'webcat'.
That is,  you get the body of the file from its stdout and "meta info"
from file descriptor 2 or 3.   (not sure if I want to mix programmatic
non-error information with human readable error messages)

        I like Hakon's stong wording about being presently bound
to the mouse.   A browser that implements all this function should have
a CLI way to fiddle with the settings at least,  if not a CLI way of
doing just about everything.   I don't use a web browser as my desktop
interface.   Instead,  I typically invoke the browser quite like the
browser invokes 'xv'.   So I want to take input from non-human sources
to merge into my preferences.

a) there isn't
b) there probably should be
c) it's only useful if there are 'helper apps' for most platforms that
actually take such a file and do something interesting with it. I've
not been able to find any simple 'MIDI-play' utilities that are
generic enough to work for the wide variety of MIDI gear. Have you?

If one sticks to General MIDI (as the original posted suggested) it might 
not be too bad. The "showmidi" program need only be interface specific 
with no reference to what MIDI gear is actually connected (as long as 
it's General MIDI).

I recently read in 'Hacker Crackdown' by Bruce Sterling about an 
underground publication called 'PHRACK', editors Knight Ligthing and 
Tara King. Does anybody know if this still exists and if so where can 
I obtain copies? I know they had quite a bit of flak in the 1989's 
with the publication of a AT&T document (enhanced 911 services). I 
need to give a talk on computer crime and hackers and would like to 
include examples of this publication...

Pointers to similar publications also appreciated.

Thanks

I am not sure about other platforms, but the Mac contains Midi support
through QuickTime 2.0 - no external Midi equipment needed. I think that I
have read somewhere that QuickTime 2.0 will also become available for
Windows soon.

So you will NEVER download packages from the net, compile them and install
them? You rely on your native OS and its utilities completely. No-one
checks source code (e.g. Gnu <fill-in-here>, XV etc etc) for "rm -r *".
Just because you compile them doesn't make them safe. The same amount
of trust applies.

Sure, Safe Scheme/Tcl/Python are great for protecting yourself. But if
you're that paranoid, why risk ftping _any_ software other than that which
you buy and get a guarantee from. Even commercial packages contain disclaimers.

This isn't really directed at this post, but just this argument, which I
have seen a couple times now...

While there are certainly many similarities between using public domain
software and documents with embedded programs, when it comes to safety I
think there are two major practical difference between them: the former
has a much more constrained distribution path, and requires that the user
explicitly retrieve and execute the software.

It is not too hard to imagine some WWW script which, when retrieved by a
browser, quietly digs out the user's home page and attaches itself there.
This kind of potential makes any current PD viruses pale in comparison;
there is simply no current situation like this, where such a high
percentage of consumers of programs are also -- even possibly unwittingly
-- producers of them.  If a virus is discovered in some PD program, it is
at least feasible to let people know such and such program has it, so that
it can be tracked down and removed.  I don't think any such action would be
possible with a WWW virus.

While you could theoretically say that browsers will warn their users when
they execute foreign scripts, I don't think this is a practical option; it
gets in the user's way enough that more than likely the vast majority of
users will either turn this off or just blindly hit "okay."  I think that
any practical scripting implementation -must- be something the user can
trust under normal circumstances.  Anything else either won't be used, or
just begging for all kinds of nastier-than-we've-ever-seen-before viruses.

The distinction is accountability. Source distributions don't
necessarily prevent attacks, but they allow you to detect them,
usually.

If you download source, presumably it has the author's email address.
Presumably that author is known to at least a few folks on the net.
If you compile the code, and it behaves antisocially, you can (1) look
at the source to find out why, (2) contact the author, or (3) sling
mud at his name publicly.

It's possible for an unnamed intruder to substitue source code with
an attack in it, but the file size or checksum of the distribution
will be different from all the other copies on the net. Granted...
not a lot of folks check that.

And in that case, the author can presumably diff the rogue sources
against his real sources and find exactly the difference.

So the same sorts of attacks that go with binaries can happen
with source distributions, but they're much more difficult to pull off.

The right answer is digitally signed distributions. Then only can
you be certain that the bits have not changed since they left
the author's hands.

Doesn't this suggest some utility in extending the URN/URL concept to
include an optional computed checksum as part of the identifier? Verifying
perfect identity of what you are getting against what you thought you were
requesting has some value for materials other than programs, too.  

The checksum could be recomputed dynamically every time the file is
transferred (as checksums are now computed dynamically every time an IP
packet is placed on or taken from a communication medium).

The HTML CyberClass(TM) is an Internet-based class on HTML, the World Wide
Web, and the effective development and use of homepages.  This class is
intended for people who have experience browsing the WWW, but are just
beginning to develop homepages.  We are considering offering more
advanced courses (including forms, image maps, searches, Perl and Bourne
Shell scripting etc.) for experienced developers in the future. 

The HTML CyberClass occurs every two months (except July-August).  The
next class will start May 1 and continue until approximately June 27. 
There is no specific "meeting time" for the class.  Participation in class
discussions, work on class assignments, communication with instructors,
all take place whenever we go online!

The CyberClass operates through a private discussion list available only
to registered class members, as well as an outline which is available to
anyone over the World Wide Web at:

http://www.halcyon.com/clearnts/html1class/outline.html

There is a lot of material explaining The HTML CyberClass linked to the
Clear Nets homepage at either of the following locations:

http://www.halcyon.com/clearnts/welcome.html     or
http://world.std.com/~habib/index.html

Please read through all this material before contacting us with
questions.  Thanks! 

The instructors of The HTML CyberClass are Peter Flynn, author of the
World Wide Web Handbook (pub: International Thomson Computer Press, 1995),
and Steve Habib Rose, Internet trainer and developer of The HTML
CyberClass. 

In cooperation with the Belgian Internet provider, Infoboard Telematics
Belgium, we are in the process of adding a truly international "flavor" to
The HTML CyberClass.  In the May-June class, we will be running a pilot
version of two discussion sections in French and German.  We are hoping to
add a Spanish language discussion section by the end of 1995, and are also
exploring the translation of class lectures and outline into different
languages.  You are encouraged to check the Clear Nets homepage throughout
the year for enhancements to the CyberClass. 

The cost for the two-month session is $150 (U.S.).  Full registration
information is available on pages linked to the Clear Nets homepage. 

Subscribers to Infoboard Telematics Belgium are requested to contact your
provider for separate registration instructions.  General information is
available on Infoboard Telematics Belgium at http://www.ib.be/

The deadline for receiving your check or money order for the May-June
session is April 25.  We must receive your check by that date to register
you for the class.  Please take into account the uncertainties of postal
delivery, particularly from overseas.  The next session is scheduled for
September-October, and the deadline for registration will be August 25. 

Thank you, and "see you" in class! 

Yours,

Steve Habib Rose

If you make the image a link, the alternative text will be a link in
non-graphical browsers, e.g.:

<A HREF="URL"><IMG SRC="foo.gif" ALT="[alternative text]></A>

Hi everyone,
Do you know if there is any MS-Windows C++ class (or set of classes) that 
implement an HTML Browser? 
I am interested to get the class(es) source code, so I could learn
how to do an HTML browser/editor.

Any freeware/shareware/commercial class(es) are OK as long as not too expensive
(it is "for me" not "for work").

Thank you for any help/pointers
Agostino

<My question is: Why does people use Mosaic when

Netscape is not free for all users.  Netscape is free for
personal users and non-profit organizations.  Companies and
government agencies that provide Web access to their users
must use a free browser, such as NCSA Mosaic, or pay for
Netscape or an enhanced Mosaic.

<Do you think that I should limit my layout so that

You should do one of 2 things:

1.  Stop using the proprietary Netscape tags and stick to
standard HTML code so that the users of your information all
see it presented as intended.

2. You can continue using the Netscape tags, but you
should inform your users that your document has been
enhanced using these tags and is best viewed in Netscape. 
This is a common signt on the Web.

My initial reaction is it makes more sense for a new document type: 
signed-html.
The viewers for signed-html then worry about authentuicating the signature and
displaying proper messages etc.
I dont think a checksum is part of either a name (URN) or a location (URL).

I am currently setting up a home page for our site and I am wondering about
Copyright and published (and not yet published) papers.  We have some people
in our group who have some various papers they have written which I would
like to put on our web server.  We are wondering what issues there are to
putting a paper on a webserver.  Can you do it after it has been published
in a journal.  Can you do it if you are going to publish it in a journal.  

Hopefully someone has an answer to this question...

Yes. In particular, it requires the MD attribute on all A and IMG tags, anything

That is another level of security, where the document can be updated by 
the original author, signed again, and the link is still valid. MD checksums 
will not cope with that, as you say.

> I dont think a checksum is part of either a name (URN) or a location (URL).

But it is part of a link, in HTML 3.0; this does not require any changes 
to the URI syntax.

This is an interesting question. If I were you, I would check with the
journal(s) first. Web publishing might count as prior publishing (if it goes
on the Web first), and the journal might not like that.
As far as putting already-published stuff on, better find out who owns the
copyright, first--it might not be the author, in some cases.

Okay. So requirements are:

1. A Safe environment (account). cf. Safe Tcl/Scheme/Python/HotJava etc.
2. Trust that the code is genuine. cf. public-key cryptography.

Now, can anyone explain why they would NEVER download applets or binaries/
bytecodes given these requirements? All I'm trying to say is that a Safe Node
system for getting and executing software is safer (yes, safer) than
current practice, so rabid instance on complete security seems a bit OTT,
though of course completely justified in its own right.

Dave.

Copyright and the Internet don't go well together.  There's a growing
amount of literature (paper and electronic) on this subject.  Basically,
copyright protection is NOT removed when you put information up on a Web
server or any other information display device.  I'm speaking of works
that are copyrighted, not public domain material.

So the question becomes, what protection can copyright holders expect if
their work is released to the Internet, especially in an open environment
like the Web?  The answer of course is none unless the Web site itself
provides that protection.  Authors can put all the copyright symbols and
statements they want on their work, but they are still relying on the good
will of the researcher and reader to respect their copyright.

Having had many articles published in journals -- and having assigned
copyright to the journal publisher as a condition of publication -- I can
say that you will need to get permission in writing from the journal -- if
it holds copyright -- to put the material up on your Web site.  No harm in
asking, you might be surprised by the answer.

Of course I do those things.  Sometimes.  When I do I think carefully 
about where I'm getting them from, look at the source, and run them for 
a while under an account I keep for that purpose with no access to 
anything (the reason why I believe that even single user machines need 
multiuser security, but that's another argument).  People actually do 
this.  I recall a discussion on this very list a few months ago about a 
package who's installation script downloaded another script and 
executed it without warning.  People noticed.

If I were a using a browser that downloaded binary applets on a regular 
basis, even that level of care would become unmanageable.  Even 
assuming that the browser warned me that it was happening.

We may be in agreement here; let me test it by saying that my original 
point was that requirement 1 cannot be met by a binary distribution, at 
least in the somewhat coarse security environment provided by current 
hardware/operating systems.  I agree that an environment that does meet 
these two requirements is safer than much current practice, and 
probably even adequate for most purposes.

I'm not sure if you really meant so, but you seem to be implying that
there's no *legal* protection for copyrighted works served on the Web,
which is incorrect.  Even when a copyright holder posts to Usenet or this
mailing list, which carries implicit permission to copy (that's how they
work, after all), the copyright remains.  On the Web, there's no implicit
permission to make more copies beyond the one created by your browser.
There's virtually never an implicit release of copyright to the public
domain; that sort of thing can only be done explicitly, in writing.

Take this message, for example.  I believe that anyone has the right to
copy this message for just about any legal purpose, since I'm sending it to
the listserv software, which makes all the copies that people might
request.  However, I still hold copyright in this message, which means that
if you misrepresented it as your own (plagiarized), I'd have a legitimate
complaint.  However, since this message has virtually no commercial value,
my complaint would be more along the lines of unfair business practice than
copyright infringement.

The second part of your paragraph strikes closer to the practical reality,
which is that it's difficult to enforce copyrights when the intellectual
property is so readily copied and transmitted.  To a large extent, we do
depend on the good will of those who read Web pages and such, but we can
help that along by including copyright notices and clear descriptions of
our intentions when posting intellectual property on a Web server.

As to the original question, absent of any written agreement to the
contrary, the author of an article contributed to a journal will hold the
copyright, assuming that it is "work for hire," rather than work performed
by an employee in the normal course of a job (in which case the employer
holds the copyright).

Disclaimers -- this isn't legal advice, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not speaking
for Verity, these are my opinions based on U.S. law.  I was the editor of
"The Multimedia Producer's Legal Survival Guide" and I'll be talking about
this subject at Web World in Santa Clara...

The ACM has announced an interim copyright policy in the current
(April 95) issue of Communications of the ACM.  I quote some excerpts
from it below.  As I understand it, it does allow authors to place
papers on Web servers under some fairly easily satisfied conditions:

"When your work is accepted for publication, the editor will ask to
transfer copyright to the ACM."

"The original copyright holder (you or your employer) retains...the
right to post a personal copy on non-ACM servers for limited
non-commercial distributions, again provided the ACM copyright notice
is attached to the personal copy and the server prominently displays a
general policy notice about use of copyrighted works it contains"

"If the number of people who have access to the distribution [server]
is less than 1% of the ACM membership (currently 1% is 800 people),
you do not need prior permission for the distribution.  If the number
is larger you should get permission from ACM and the copies should
cite that permission."

The ACM copyright notice grants "permission to make digital or hard
copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom
use.. provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or
commercial advantage and that new copies bear this notice and the full
citation on the first page".

NCSA X Mosaic version 2.6b1 is now available for beta testing.
Binaries and source are available from 

ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Unix/


Improvements to 2.6b1

 o Inline JPEGs are supported. 
 o mailto URLs are supported. 
 o Improved Usenet support, including threaded newsgroup listings and article
   posting. 
 o Common Client Interface now supports POST to server, 
   SEND BROWSERVIEW and QUIT browser protocol functionality. 
 o PostScript printing and saving optionally includes URL and page number as
   page header. 
 o Minimal group annotation support. Set the annotationServer resource
   to the URL of your CGI annotation server. 
 o The URL text field is now editable. Pressing Enter within the text 
   field causes Mosaic to open the displayed URL. 
 o Load to local disk can now be activated on a one-time basis by holding down
   the shift key while clicking on a hyperlink. 
 o HTTP header Accept now lists only */* instead of a long string of MIME
   types. 
 o HTTP header Referer now contains a document's parent URL (for hyperlinks
   that are clicked-on with the mouse pointer, only). 
   NCSA httpd 1.4 can log the Referer field. 
 o HTTP header User-Agent now uses a slightly different format, for
   consistency with other platforms: 

    User-Agent: NCSA Mosaic/2.6b1 (X11; SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m) libwww/2.12 modified

 o Code has been Saber tested.

Is it possible that this field will ever conform to the spec?

Since there are parts of HTML 3.0 in the browser now (tables), could you 
*please* add

Accept: text/html; level=3

as per the W3O directive?  Even better would be something like

Accept: text/html; level=3; q=1.0
Accept: text/html; q=0.5

That way those of us with content-negotiating servers (yes, www.hotwired.com
is now a content-negotiating server - compare http://www.hotwired.com/ in
arena and netscape, and look closely at the source.  Arena can't parse the
Content-type header with extra info quite right yet so the HTML 3 is tagged
as text/html for now instead of text/html;level=3 but as soon as arena is
fixed we'll change) can dish HTML 3 pages to HTML 3 clients and HTML 2 to
HTML 2 clients.  I know X Mosaic doesn't support all of HTML 3 yet, but the
only way we're going to have a smooth transition is if the above happens even
while HTML 3 is being developed. 

If I add a "please" would this help things?  :)  I'd rather not have the 
server negotiate based on User-Agent instead!

			    GENERAL INFORMATION
			    ===================

Win32s Update Information
-------------------------

Windows NT users and Win95 beta-testers
---------------------------------------
Windows NT and Win95 are 32-bit operating systems with Win32s and OLE  
support built into the operating system. Users of Windows NT and Win95  
should NOT install Win32s on their systems.


Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups Users
--------------------------------------------
You have a 16-bit operating system and you'll need to install  
Microsoft's Win32s software. This software will allow you to run 32-bit  
applications in Windows 3.1 or WfW 3.11. Since Mosaic is also an OLE  
compatible application, Mosaic users must use Win32s with the OLE. The  
latest version of Win32s is available at NCSA's ftp site,  
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, in the /Mosaic/Windows directory. The file  
w32sOLE.exe is a self-extracting executable. After you download the  
file, put it in a temporary directory (c:\install), type w32sOLE, and  
all associated files will decompress.

The latest version of Win32s version 1.25.  It was released by Micorsoft  
to address the National Language Support problem and the compobj.dll  
problem some Windows users were experiencing with version 1.20. We  
recommend you upgrade to this latest version if you prefer to use a  
language other than English(American) in your Windows environment, OR if  
you experiencing problems with the compobj.dll library while using  
Microsoft Office, Excel or Word. In general, if you are NOT experiencing 
problems with Win32s v1.20, upgrading to Win32s v1.25 is not required.

Win32s must be installed BEFORE you install attempt to install Mosaic.

At the outset, let me say that my arguments were and still are from the
viewpoint of a dissemination strategy for existing technology and not from a
viewpoint of research.  To explain, I am more concerned with the question -

"How do we make sure that all this great technology doesn't get lost in
the marketing noise that will very soon flood the airwaves ?" and "How can
safe-tcl survive inspite of all the proprietary efforts ?"  

*rather than*

"What is the best/safest/most mature and proven technology".

This last question, is in my opinion, not always the right question to ask
*if we are concerned about market acceptance* which I believe we all
are.  Technically superb designs and implementations have failed to 
achieve market share, and in fact it is more the rule that technically
mediocre or even flawed technology ( need I mention the M.. company ) can
garner commanding positions through massive and well directed marketing
efforts. 
 
I initiated the intermediate language ( used here in the colloquial
sense of intermediate, rather than the CS sense of lower-level )
thread only to draw attention to the fact that a large number of 
relatively non-sophisticated users will be arriving soon. If the
current safe-tcl effort doesn't take them into account, they ( the
naive users ) will, by default, settle for the warmed over offerings 
from MediocreSoft(tm), your friendly neighborhood software company 
that wants to take over the whole world.

Having a platform like MS Network will give it a means to foist very
crude active mail models on a largely unsuspecting user/programmer
population in the vein of Dos, Win3.1, Visual Basic etc. Historically,
the Unix/Internet/University/Research Lab community has ignored these
technically unsophisticated approaches assuming they will fail in the market.

And people continue to think that because they don't
understand the Internet technology/culture MicroSplat will fail. 
How naive !!!

I feel that a similar thing may happen with the enabled mail efforts
and that alot of great technology may end up being just that - great technology
but with no ensuing products.  The bottom line is - there are no
known commercial products out there that are openly using safe-tcl.
A way to piggyback onto the momentum generated by  marketing-driven efforts
of MicroSpiff (tm )
would be to position safe-tcl as the intermediate language, thus leveraging all
existing development efforts and also using proven and safe technology.

Thus any restricted technology foisted upon the world by MicroSquash(tm),
your innovative, creative, communications company, will remain restricted in
use to the MSNetwork and safe-tcl efforts need not have to twist themselves
out of shape. In addition, to access the new and exciting content on the
Internet outside MS Network, MS Network users will have to have a way to
access safe-tcl based Net hosts. Voila'  safe-tcl intermediate language
to the rescue.

Enabled-mail content will remain safe-tcl, which can be translated into
and out of at sending and receiving ends respectively.  Rather than being
the all-encompassing enabled-mail language everywhere which is a very hard
goal to achieve, why not be the *transported language* of choice ?

This positions safe-tcl as complementary to any proprietary technology
and not in opposition.  My belief is that a head-to-head language war
with Visible Balsamic (tm) will fail simply from the numbers stand
point, and then you won't get a second chance.

The real question is, does the safe-tcl community want safe-tcl to ever be
a commercially deployed technology or is it something that is preferably kept
as a research plaything.  I don't see a clear answer to that question but the
responses I have received suggest that most safe-ctl users are from the
research side of things. ( At this point I woul like to add that this
doesn't, in any way deprecate the future efforts of the Ousterhout group
- I would consider their efforts to be based on producing tcl development tools
whereas when I say "products" I mean something outside the realm of   
development per se eg end-user products that are produced by safe-tcl
developers. )

My feeling is that if the safe-tcl community wants
to survive and prosper in commercial realms, they will have to start asking
different questions - questions more directed towards disseminating and
diffusing existing technology into commercial *products* and move away
from focusing on "my language is better than yours". I would like to suggest
that the "better" language doesn't always win in the market place.

So the real question is do we want to be a market/product based technology or
do we want to do some real neat things in our spare time ?
The kind of questions we are concerned with are, in my opinion, quite
different in the two cases.

Well, it's not far from it. Everything within '(' and ')' is to be considered
a comment which is not part of the field, but is allowed. So what is left is
the two phrases:

	 NCSA Mosaic/2.6b1	and 	libwww/2.12 modified

Here the problem is that both contain a space which is not allowed in a token.

A User-Agent field like

   User-Agent: NCSA-Mosaic/2.6b1 (X11; SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m) libwww/2.12-modified

would be OK.

  I proposed to the HTTP working group that this be changed to something
like:

User-Agent: NCSA Mosaic/2.6b1 ; library=libwww/2.12 modified ;
            os=SunOS 4.1.3 sun4m ; windowsystem=X11R5 ;
            other-fun=here

  This follows in the tradition of MIME having information that modifies
the main value (text/html ; version=3.0) - the version of Mosaic is
considered to be the main value, and all the others are just slight
modifications.  This also doesn't break old log engines that had to deal
with the severely broken way that NCSA mosaic used before.

  A few people liked it, but seems to be an HTTP/1.1 issue.

Hi,

about Mosaic2.5.

Trying to deal with tables in NCSA Mosaic 2.5, I'm facing some problems. I use 
a Sun Sparc20 running under SunOs 4.1.3

I used the tutorial at 
	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Tables/tutorial.html.

1. It appears that when a tag, (e.g. <B>...</B>)
is placed in a cell, it doesn't show on screen. More than that, the text that
follows the closing tag is lost and the cell doesn't format well. Lists,
Images don't show in the NCSA Tutorial. 
	(Sorry, I've just seen it's
	a reported bug in version 2.5)

2. When I save or print a page that contains a table from Mosaic (in Postscript, plain or formatted text), the table is lost in the saved file.

Did I misconfigure Mosaic 2.5 or is it a known problem about this version ?

Thanks

I strongly doubt that.  (And see below for stronger opinion.)
     
Viruses are instructions that need something to execute them.  (Biological 
viruses effectively are chemical instructions that need the chemical environ- 
ment of a cell to execute them; computer viruses are instructions in some form 
(e.g., hardware instructions, shell commands, mailer control file commands) 
that need some agent (e.g., hardware, shell, mailer program) to execute them.)
     
There have been mail viruses (or were they worms?), but as far as I know they 
are executed by the software that moves mail around, not by the end-users mail 
reader.
     
(For example, here's a virus:
     
"Send a copy of this sentence to someone else."
     
It is instructions to you, the human reader.  If you follow the instructions, 
it propagates; if you don't, it doesn't; if you ignore it and delete it, it 
dies.
     
Obviously, this virus isn't very effective, because humans usually will 
choose not to follow the instructions.  But it is a virus.
     
Hey!  I just realized---THE FORWARDED RUMOR IS A VIRUS!  (It doesn't 
explicitly contain instructions to forward it, but it's written knowing that 
people repeat rumors, so that's an implicit instruction to forward it. 
Therefore, it is a virus.)
     
But I, one valiant little antibody in the Internet immune system, have 
recognized the invader, and have mutated it, hopefully sentencing it to 
death.
     
(Now if only someone could do something about those (ex-?) lawyers who keep 
spamming the Internet...)
     
)

THIS IS 100% BULLSHIT!  Infinite loops don't damage CPUs.  And infinite 
loops are infinite loops; there's no such thing as "an nth-complexity 
infinite binary loop."
     
If readers don't believe me yet, then consider this:  The warning doesn't 
say anything about which kind(s) of computer the virus infects.  Because 
viruses are instructions, they can only infect hardware or software that 
understands and executes that type of instructions.  The only thing machines 
have to have in common to exchange mail is they they understand and process 
mail formats.  Therefore, any mail virus must be composed of instructions
in mail-exchange protocols, and those protocols aren't powerful enough to 
express the instructions needed to erase a disk (maybe fill it up with junk, 
but not erase it).

So...
     
Why did this bogus rumor start?
- Someone naive misunderstood something, including maybe a joke? 
- Some idiot decided to start a rumor?
- Someone is trying to prevent someone else's message from being read?
     
Why is Fell_Travis (dal11_tjfell@dal.mobil.com) passing it along?
- He (or she?) didn't know that it was bullshit, and was innocently passing 
	along a warning?
- He is an accomplice?

This strikes me as the $64M question.  Language translators are a
difficult thing to get right.  I have no idea, a priori, whether it is
easier to translate Python and Scheme into Tcl, or Python and Tcl into
Scheme, or Scheme and Tcl into Python.  I don't see any path to a quick
answer, and that concerns me.  -- Nathaniel

Hello,

My company needs to set up its own httpd server. None of us has any 
experience with it. We managed to get the NCSA httpd server up and have
set up a company home page. Can anyone suggest any good books or online
materials for admininstering a httpd server, writing CGI scripts, etc?

Thanks for any suggestions.
