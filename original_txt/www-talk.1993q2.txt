Yes, we have very crude filters for converting clean SGML to TeX
-- just 'sed' files.   They will take the output of the NextStep
WorldWideWeb.app becaus it puts line breaks in and so sed
can handle it.

If you want to make a converter which parses the HTML properly,
you could take the line mode client version 2.0, and
in the library just hack the HTML regeneration module
HTMLGen.{c,h} to produce TeX instead of HTML. The module
is driven by a stream of text and element stop/start by
element number, so it is just a set of tables of strings.

If you are interested in our mapping, ask Arthur Secret
<secret@dxcern.cern.ch> to mail you our latest sed files.
We in fact made one new latex macro  for the paper docs
we push out, in order to do a better job of DL lists.

The basic sed files for making article style latex are
on the web ... look under "tools for information providers".

Great idea! It seems daft though to have to first down load the files
before playing them. What we need is a smarter approach which concurrently
retreives the audio data and pipes it into the audio player process.

You will still need a few seconds (~5) to fill up a fifo so that you don't
get gaps in the sound track due fluctuations in network traffic.

Unfortunately, very few of us in HPLabs have audio capability on our
workstations - grr gnash grr

Subject: Summary of WWW BOF at IETF


There was a small meeting about WWW at the 26th 
Internet Engineering Task Force meeting in Columbus
Ohio on Tuesday.   This is a summary for the record.

Tim BL

                              
                       WWW BOF Minutes
                              
            This  is a summary of the discussion at the  WWW
          BOF at the 26th IETF.
     Status
            Tim   Berners-Lee   mentioned   a   few   recent
          developments:
                  + NCSA's "Mosaic" WWW client for  X11
                    agreed by the meeting to be the best
                    information access tool to date.  This
                    is at an advanced beta state (version
                    0.12).  FTP pickup rate for this product
                    now excedes that for NCSA telnet.
                  + A Windows client for MS-DOS machines
                    exists, the equivalent of XMosaic but
                    for PCs.   It is user configurable and
                    looks good.  A problem with release is
                    that a runtime licence is needed for te
                    TCP stack used (Distinct).
                  + The growth rate of access to the CERN
                    server has continued to double every
                    four months for the last two years with
                    no sign of tapering off.
     Man pages on the web
            Steve  Romig  of Ohio State was congrtulated  on
          his server server for unix manual pages.  This  is
          a  good  example  of an automatic server  (a  perl
          script  in  this case) which provides  a  powerful
          data  access.   Steve agreed  to  make  his  tools
          available on the web.
     Web Agenda
            There was a discussion of things which should be
          done  to  make  it easier for the web  to  spread.
          These include
                  + Better packaging of CERN sofware, in
                    particular the server: simpler
                    installation, irrelevant file hiding,
                    etc.
                  + Licencising of CERN software:  There was
                    deep concern expressed that investment
                    by others in WWW related projects wuld
                    be jepardized later by CERN's licencing
                    conditions, in the way that the
                    University of Minnesota have pulled the
                    rug out from under the Gopher project.
                    The General Public (Gnu-style) licence
                    was not so acceptable as pure public
                    domain code.  The meeting was quite
                    intent that this be solved very quickly.
                  + A better vt100 full-screen browser is
                    needed for a large dial-up user base.
            NCSA  are  likely to bring out a  public  domain
          very  simple  to  install  server,  as  a  partial
          solution to the first two issues issues.
            There was a proposal to create a small group  to
          implement the vt100 client, which formed and  aims
          to implement the product for public release.
          vt100 client
            [Note:   Minutes  after the BOF we  received  an
          announcement of the "Lynx" 2.0 beta release by Lou
          Montulli.  This may solve the problem or at  least
          provide  a  base.   Lynx is a  vt100  full  screen
          hypertext  WWW client.  Check it out by telnetting
          to  ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu and logging  in  as  www.
          Source and binaries are available by anon FTP from
          acs220.cc.ukans.edu]
     Standards
            The  three standards important for WWW  at  this
          stage are:
            The Universal Resource Locators spec defines the
          addressing syntax used by WWW.    This  is  to  be
          released immediately as an Internet Draft for  the
          standards track.
            The    Hypertext    Markup   Language     (HTML)
          specification  defines the  transport  format  for
          menus, hypertext and general online documentation.
          This  must  be  specified at RFC  standards  track
          level  in order to be submitted as a MIME content-
          type.  This in turn is necessary as HTTP uses MIME
          format  for returned multimedia messages,  and  we
          want   it  to  stay  MIME-compliant.   HTML   will
          therefore be released as an Internet Draft as soon
          as possible.
            HTTP is the access protocol used by WWW servers.
          An  extended (back-compatible) version  is in  use
          in the 2.0 and above CERN software.  This is quite
          open  to  extension  and so  any  comment  on  the
          protocol should be discussed on the www-talk list.
            It was agreed to put these documents through the
          IIR  working group whose chaiman, Chis Wieder, has
          agreed  to  oversee their passage.  The  BOF  will
          not, therfore, meet again or propose a WWW working
          group.
     Mailing lists and newsgroup
            To  join the technical mailing list, send a mail
          message to the address

                    www-talk-request@info.cern.ch

Or alternately we need to harness packet audio/video into the
distributed hypermedia environment, so one can link to real-time
multicast feeds that are possibly kicked off on the remote system on
demand.  ??

That would be fun! I recently attended a TCP/IP course given by
Jon Crowcroft (J.Crowcroft@cs.ucl.ac.uk) who told me that University
College London have been doing just this kind of thing.

They did live multicast audio to Europe of Bill Clinton's speech at
Silicon Graphics during his recent well publicised visit there. Thats
how I found out about the need for a 5 second fifo to avoid breaks.

A lot of work is going on in on multicast and we should hear results
soon. In the meantime I think that there is plenty you can do with
good old tcp and WWW audio replay on demand. The japanese telecoms
giant NTT have even demonstrated sending video via tcp, although this
does require some impressive video compression/decompression hardware
that will be a while coming to most workstations.

Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.36.1.1]

Here at Hewlett Packard, we need a way of preventing unauthorised
access to information, but want to take advantage of the WWW for
sharing information with colleagues.

Please give me your comments on our proposed solution.

I am working on a solution that makes use of UNIX's established
security mechanisms and making it easy for non-technical types
to manage things for themselves without the need to call out
the support staff.

Each web server can be run in two modes depending on a command line switch:

  Mode 1
  ======

    a)  all world readable files are accessible
    b)  systems in the .rhosts file are treated appropriately
    c)  all other files require a user name & password

  Mode 2
  ======

    a)  systems in the .rhosts file are treated appropriately
    b)  otherwise all files 

The Authorisation: field in HTTP2 is used to carry the username
and password, e.g.

    Authorisation: user fred:secret

Where "user" identifies the following as being username:password
which must refer to a valid user account on the host system. This
approach avoids the need for people to manage special configuration files.
We may also add a file similar to the .rhost file but specific to the web.

The browser keeps track of which system/protocol needs what user name/
password, and so only asks you once for each system per session. I am
also looking at using X11's interprocess communication facilities so
that multiple concurrent invokations of the browser can share the
same info to further minimise the pain.

The same approach is also used for our gateway from our closed subnet
to the rest of the world. This gateway relays tcp connections, but doesn't
accept requests to connect from the outside. I hence have to use ftp in
the passive mode.

In the future we will investigate more flexible approaches such as Kerberos
that avoid sending passwords in clear (unlike most UNIX apps such as ftp,
rlogin etc.).

I've thought about implementing something like this, and I think
that's a reasonable starter solution.

(I'm sure you know all this already, but I'll mention it anyway...)

- If you want more than token security, passwords flying around the
  network in the clear is obviously a Bad Thing.
- Since the data is passed across the net in the clear, disclosure
  protection may or may not be attained; it depends whether this is
  going on a LAN or a WAN or what.

Kerberos type models are possible, but I don't think the current HTTP2
standard could work with kerberos (I believe this would require a
fundamental change in the request-response to something like
request-challenge-reply-response, which is a big change.  Or am I
recalling the changes to version 5 incorrectly?)

Ultimately, the general solution should be simple enough; since we're
already using MIME mail-like mechanisms for content identification,
once MIME and PEM are made interoperable (standards should be out
soon), you can have signed PEM (or PEM-like) requests and encrypted
responses.  There would be some trickiness, since the headers of the
response message are among what needs to be authenticated.  The bad
part is that PEM isn't here today, and may not be here any time
particularly soon.  But it's obviously the right solution in the long
run, particularly since the certification hierarchy would allow the
kind of legal mechanisms for non-deniability of origin and disclosure
protection that would be highly desirable for, say, a publisher to
make copyrighted works available via WWW for a modest fee.

Since I'm already posting to the list, anyone who is in the process of
trying to write a WWW server in perl may wish to glance at a brief
commentary in http://cs.indiana.edu/perl-server/intro.html that I
made; this includes some discussion of the design guidelines involved
in its creation (which are probably rather controversial) and the
code.  It's not code that you can just pop in and run on your machine,
but your friendly neighborhood perl hacker might find it interesting
to look at.

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working
binaries, or development systems, are welcome.)  Documentation is
available online.

Changes since 0.11 include:

 o Files retrieved via binary transfer mode now get a file selection box
   for user-provided filename. 
 o Inlined image widths are now taken into account when formatting
   text & images together. 
 o Fixed trigger of server bug on some systems wrt freeing color cells. 
 o Inlined images work on 24-bit TrueColor servers now. 
 o GUI interface for mailing hotlist and window history lists. 
 o Support for <ol> (numbered lists). 
 o Better support for nested description lists. 
 o Support for <tt>, <b>, <i>, <em>, <strong>, <code>, <samp>,
   <kbd>, <var>, and corresponding resources italicFont, boldFont, and
   fixedFont. 
 o Better 8-bit cleanliness. 
 o Bug with inlined images as anchors at end of documents fixed. 
 o Compact description lists: <dl compact> causes first line of <dd>
   text to jump up on same line with <dt> if room exists. 
 o SGML representations of 8-bit ISO8859 characters now work. 
 o Fixed bugs with weird Lucida font metrics on DEC Alpha and a few
   other servers. 
 o Fixed coredump triggered by <li>'s outside of a list. 
 o Fixed coredumps on malformed URL's like telnet:machine.name. 
 o Fixed coredumps on malformed URL's like
   gopher:/gopher.uiuc.edu/. 
 o Various document types returned via WAIS searches are now
   detected (by extension only) and forked to viewers as appropriate. 
 o Fixed minor bug with disappearing whitespace. 
 o Fixed bug with extraneous newlines in description lists in very
   narrow windows. 
 o Fixed bug with erroneous description elements causing text to fall
   off the left side of the screen. 
 o Audio annotations on HP systems with audio hardware work now. 
 o Default SGI audio annotation quality is lower now, to decrease disk
   space usage. 
 o SCO Open Desktop support. 
 o Harris Nighthawk support. 
 o AIX 3.2 support for reading local directories.

Subject: Status of 2.02-beta (source and binary for sun4)

Tim,

I am a little confused over the status of httpd_2.02-beta, the sources on
info.cern.ch, and their relationship to httpd_2.02-beta and httpd_2.03-beta
(this is for a sun4).

Neither httpd_2.02-beta nor httpd_2.03-beta correctly return gif, mpeg or ps
files for me.

>-rwxrwxr-x  1 timbl    www       114688 Mar 17 17:01 httpd_2.02-beta
>-rwxrwxr-x  1 timbl    www       114688 Apr  1 18:00 httpd_2.03-beta

a typical error being ....

>HTFormat: Sorry, can't convert from application/postscript to www/present.<BODY>
><H1>Error 501</H1>
>
>  Sorry, can't convert from application/postscript to www/present.</BODY>

so I got the sources ....

>-rw-rw-r--  1 timbl    www       102293 Jan 27 14:47 WWWDaemon_0.9b.tar.Z
>-rw-rw-r--  1 timbl    www       145366 Mar 17 16:06 WWWDaemon_2.02-beta.tar.Z
>-rw-rw-r--  1 timbl    www       122575 Jan  6 16:39 WWWLibrary_1.1a.tar.Z
>-rw-rw-r--  1 timbl    www       168669 Mar 17 16:07 WWWLibrary_2.02-beta.tar.Z
>-rw-rw-r--  1 timbl    www        66881 Dec 14 12:13 WWWLineMode_1.4.tar.Z
>-rw-rw-r--  1 timbl    www        68803 Mar 16 15:27 WWWLineMode_2.0-alpha.tar.Z

and then unpacking WWWDaemon_2.02-beta.tar.Z, WWWLibrary_2.02-beta.tar.Z and
WWWLineMode_2.0-alpha.tar.Z which I had assumed would be sufficient to build
the current copy of httpd_2.02-beta (the dates on the tar files match nicely
with httpd_2.02-beta) ....

Running BUILD makes the sun4 Library then fails...

>mkdir ../../LineMode/sun4
>mkdir: ../../LineMode/sun4: File exists
>*** Error code 1 (ignored)

looking at Makefile.product ....

>% more All/Implementation/Makefile.product
>#       Make WWW product
>include ../../Specific/$(WWW_MACH)/Makefile.include

its obvious that Specific needs changing to All ....

missing file so after unpacking WWWDaemon_0.9b.tar.Z and overlaying with
WWWDaemon_2.02-beta.tar.Z ....

since I could not find HTDaemon.h and it doesnt appear to be necessary I
edited HTRetrieve.c to comment out the include file and everything then
recompiles ....

After this exercise the newly made httpd delivers both gif and Postscript
correctly but I am still seeing "Error 501" for .mpg files.

Have I missed something here?

People who already have Mosaic app-defaults files installed on their

resources:
        
        anchorColor
        visitedAnchorColor
        activeAnchorBG
        activeAnchorFG

...are no longer the resource names, capitalized.  

In other words, in your existing app-defaults file, you should
lower-case the first letter of each of AnchorColor,
VisitedAnchorColor, ActiveAnchorBG, and ActiveAnchorFG.  The 0.12
app-defaults files in the source distribution and in
/Mosaic/xmosaic-appdefaults on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu have this change
taken into account.

Sorry for the confusion,

Dear Tim

What mechanism do you want to see for adding some simple extensions to HTML
e.g. to support forms and tables? As you know, I have thought quite a bit
about both of these. Perhaps an experimental browser and sample docs are
needed?

What happened to our ideas for having richer forms with support for
multiple fields? I enclose for you my proposal for extending HTML to 
support such forms. An outstanding issue is how you can escape special
characters in search string. I seem to remember that &#32; style
sgml character references are permitted, but this seems to be missing from
the current addressing bnf doc:

    http://info.cern.ch:80/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/BNF.html


The following is part of an exchange I had with Dan Connolly in January on
the modifications to HTML needed for such forms:

    1)  server sends whole form in response to a GET command

    2)  user interacts with client only to fill out form

    3)  user instructs client to send completed form to server

    4)  client sends form contents to server as a query string

    5)  server executes query and returns results

A smarter/more sophistocated system would include scripts as part of the
queryform document, which apply the constraints locally WITHOUT any network
delays. BUT that seems too open-ended and complex for us to put in HTML for
now!

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

p.s. Did you get my suggestions for tables in HTML?


---A brief explanation of HTML forms:---------------------------------------

Forms are composed from the following elements

    o   checkbox (boolean)
    o   text field
    o   numeric field (integer and floating point)
    o   radio-button groups
    o   one-from-many menu
    o   n-from-m menu

These are specified with 4 new tags:

        <queryform>     appears between <head> and </head>
                        to indicate that this document is a query form, it
                        optionally specifies an href for processing the query

        <input>         boolean values, text, integer and floats

        <select>        radio buttons and selection menus

        <choice>        specifying alternatives for <select>

A formal definition is given later on as an extension to the DTD. An informal
definition is given first:

When the browser finds the <queryform> the user can fill in the form
and use it to make a request. The browser should offer a search button or
menu action. The <input> and <select> tags are then used to build the text
search string to send to the user.

The format for sending form contents back to the server has been chosen to
be backwards compatible with older HTTP servers. Thus the search string is
restricted to letters, digits, and chars from the string "$_@!%^&*()."

    QUERY  ::=  FIELD [+QUERY]
    FIELD  ::=  name@value | name@(VALUES)
    VALUES ::=  value [&VALUE]

e.g. "name@value+name@(value&value)

The use of brackets for multiple values allows servers to continue to treat
the characters &, ^, ! for logical operators.

The tags for form fields look like (more detail in the DTD):

    <input name=FIELDNAME type=FIELDTYPE [width=FIELDWIDTH]>

    FIELDNAME is a unique identifier for this form
    FIELDTYPE ::= "boolean" | "text" | "date" | "integer" | "float"

    The [ ] brackets denote optional attributes.
    
The width can be optional, since the browser can support sideways scrolling
of the input field when the entry exceeds the current display width. For line
mode browsers, this requires a cursor addressing functionality, like CURSES.

The "date" format accepts a date in one of the following formats:

    o   12th June 1992
    o   June 12th 1992
    o   12/6/92
    0   6/12/92
    o   12-6-92
    o   12 Jun 92

The format is indifferent to MM/DD/YY or DD/MM/YY, and the form's text should
make it clear which is expected.

Multiple choice items need a richer structure, e.g.

    <select name=FIELDNAME type=CHOICETYPE [value=VALUE]>
        <choice>item 1
        <choice>item 2
        <choice>item 3
    </select>

    CHOICETYPE ::= "radio" | "single" | "multiple"

The choice initially shown is given by the value attribute for the <select>
token, defaulting to the first choice. The value returned is the item text
unless a "value" attribute is defined for that <choice>.

    <choice value=VALUETEXT>

I think that <a> tags should be permissible for <choice> text so that you can
provide further explanations upon request for each choice. If there isn't a
value attribute then the displayable text for the anchor would form part of
that choice in the obvious manner. The DTD includes a help parameter which
would permit browsers to offer help on form elements.

Forms generally involve additional ideas:

    a)  expressions and queries for output fields

    b)  edits (constraints) on input field values

    c)  dependencies between fields

These can all be handled by the server, albeit with a performance penalty as
perceived by the user.

It is important to be able to show the current values as currently being in
error (along with an explanation). For example you could have a form for
configuring a computer system, which gives you choices for the number of hard
and soft drives:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *  Fixed Drive(s): [2 x 512 Gb disk]
     *  Soft Drive(s):  [1 x 1.44 Mb 3.5" floppy]

 (*) Error: you are only allowed a combined total of 2 fixed and soft drives
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So we need to provide attributes to:

    a)  signify that the current choice is in error in some way
    b)  that a given choice is not currently permissible (grayed out)

This can be done with two attributes (both default to "yes"):

    ok="yes" | "no"             ;;  for <input> and <select>
    enabled="yes" | "no"        ;;  for <choice>

-----Additions to HTML DTD for QueryForms----------------------------------

<!-- uses Dan's definition for %URL, %inline and %text -->

<!-- The queryform element needs adding to the spec for HEAD -->

<!ELEMENT HEAD - - (TITLE ? & ISINDEX ? & QUERYFORM ? & NEXTID ? & LINK *
                        & BASE ? )>

<!ELEMENT QUERYFORM - 0 EMPTY]
<!ATTLIST QUERYFORM HREF %URL; #IMPLIED>

<!-- The following defines the <input> tag with the attributes:

    name    (required)
        unique name used to identify field to server

    type    (required)
        indicates type of input value (boolean, text, date, integer, float)

    width   (optional, defaults to 20)
        width for field in terms of average char width
        browsers should allow users to type up to this number of chars
        and no more (except for dealing with control keys e.g. backspace)

    value   (optional, defaults to null or "")
        initial value to display in the input field

    ok      (optional, defaults to yes)
        when no, signifies that the current value is in error.

    enabled (optional, default to yes)
        when no, prevents user from changing this field's value

    help    (optional, default provided by application)
        a URI which would provide explanatory information for this field
-->

<!ENTITY % url "CDATA" -- this is kind of a DTD macro >
<!ELEMENT input - O EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST input
    name ID #REQUIRED
    type (boolean|text|date|integer|float) #REQUIRED
    width NUMBER "20"
    value CDATA ""
    ok (yes|no) "yes"
    enabled (yes|no) "yes"
    help %URL; #IMPLIED
>

<!-- The following defines the <select> tag for selection menus -->

<!ENTITY SELECT - - (CHOICE)*>

<!ATTLIST select
    name ID #REQUIRED
    type (radio|single|multiple) #REQUIRED
    value PCDATA ""
    ok (yes|no) "yes"

<!-- The following defines the <choice> tag which is
        used to specify choices for the <select> tag  -->

<!ENTITY CHOICE - O (%text; | CHOICE)*>

<!ATTLIST choice
    value PCDATA "" #REQUIRED

Subject: NCSA Mosaic for X 0.12 released.

Kudos once again to the NCSA folks!!!  Two (or was it three) weeks ago
when Marc et al released Xmosaic 0.10 I ftp'd it and built it on my system,
hardly able to contain my excitement over the video capabilities. (I am
also interested in the audio stuff, but Data General Aviions don't
possess such)  It immediately puked when trying to display one of the
bitmaps, so I sent a trace back to Marc who passed it one to one
of their other programmers who recognized the problem as an 8 bit versus
24 bit TrueColor problem (because of the way 24 bit handles colors).
Well... in 0.12 that problem is resolved!  Most commercial products
don't offer that rapid of a response to bugs.

Keep up the great work, I am still beating my drum trying to
convince mgmt here that this is what we should be using for some
of the hypertext applications they are interested in around here.

I would very much like to see both TABLES and FORMS implemented in HTML. I 
have a number of applications which could benefit greatly from the addition of 
these facilities. 

I like your specific proposals for TABLE and FORMS and think they should form 
the basis for discussion of extension of the HTML format in these areas.

I have previously suggested that we use the %nn (eg %32) syntax for special 
characters in search strings. (See my message to www-talk, 25-Feb-1993, subj: 
"Handling + in document searches") In reposonse to this note TimBL suggested 
this would be implemented in the next version of the WWWLibrary. I would 
certainly like to see this (or something giving equivalent functionality) 
documented in the HTTP documentation.

Here is an excerpt from the changelog (since the last release):

Mon Apr  5 13:34:00 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.007beta - second release
* Revamped local files - now use file:/ instead of nonstandard local:/
* Added better handling of definition lists.  (No support for Compact
  ones now though)

Fri Apr  2 10:28:08 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Definition lists now keep their zones/extents so they are highlighted
  correctly. 
* Fixed bug in <PRE> handling - left out a (goto-char (point-min))

Wed Mar 31 08:51:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Did work on resolving ./ & ../ links (only works for one level right
  now.  Will work on getting it recursive later.
* Changed data field in extents/zones to be (w3 . <type>) so I
  wouldn't grab a wrong item.
* Fixed a bug in title handling.  Left something out of an if
  statement and it would try to delete a region that (probably) didn't
  exist.
* Fixed bug in w3-follow-link (added a ':' to end of regexp).  Would
  cause it to screw up on a url like http.html.  Thanks to Erik Ostrom
  (eostrom@nic.gac.edu)
* Changed requires to autoloads where possible
* Wrapped require of transparent.el so it won't get loaded if in X
* Fixed bug in lemacs mouse links.
* Applied numerous patches from har@cs.cmu.edu & jwz@lucid.com to fix
  compilation problems with lemacs & epoch.

Tue Mar 30 15:05:01 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added mouse support for following links in epoch & lucid emacs
  Store the link # in the data segment of the zone.  If mouse is
  clicked in a zone, extract the data, assoc it with w3-links-list and
  call w3-follow-link with it.  Hacky but works. :)
* Added (provide 'w3) for easier loading, etc.
* Fixed problems with epoch highlihting
* Fixed makefile problem (some files left out)

Sun Mar 28 13:04:12 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added auto-viewing of ps/gif/jpg/etc files
* Added uncompression and gunzipping auto-recognition

Sat Mar 27 12:32:54 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.004beta - first release
* Few changes to the parser
* Fixed PRE Handling so it parses out urls inside.
* Added handling of &#XXX to insert ascii value of XXX.

-- William M. Perry (wmperry@indiana.edu) --
If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.

Tony, Dave, folks in general:

Characters otherwise not allowed in a URL SHALL be escaped using
the %nn notation, and ARE handled this way in the 2.0 WWW library
server and client.

This is is not just a suggestion! :-)

Subject: Improvements on HTML. 
Cc: dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com, www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch



There have been a lot of improvements proposed for HTML.

	- Various forms of includion of graphics
	- Tables
	- Forms

I think we should get some concrete proposals for an HTML2 out
onto this list.  This would bring us closer to a DTD for the
new thing, which would allow everyone to go out and
implement it.

It is important that noon gets the feeling that the basic
HTML spec is shifting under their feet, so a new name for the
enhanced format might be useful. But not endless discussion of it.

The new format should of course be a superset of HTML.  The first
thing it should incldue is indefinite nesting of constructs
which is not allowed in HTML.

To kick off the discussion, I propose for the forms part the
following

FIELDS
======
<FIELD NAME="f1" FIELDTYPE=TEXT MAXLEN=40>     </FIELD>

This field could be inserted anywhere, including
inside lists and character emphasis, and so would pick up
the formatting from that.  Any contents of the field
would, in a basic form, represent a default value.

The fieldtype could default to text, but other values
could be for example INT, FLOAT, URI. The latter would
allow icons to be dropped in, or bookmarks pasted in,
for giving references to other documents.
Example:

<h2>Personal Details</h2>
<DL>
<DT>Name<DD><EM><FIELD NAME="nam" FIELDTYPE=TEXT  
MAXLEN=40></FIELD></EM>
<DT>Address<DD><FIELD NAME="adr" FIELDTYPE=TEXT MAX=200></FIELD>
<DT>Children<DD><FIELD NAME="kids" FIELDTYPE=INT> 0 </FIELD>
<DT>Publications<DD><FIELD NAME="pubs" FIELDTYPE=URI MAX=100></FIELD>
</DL>
Any other comments?
<PRE>
<FIELD NAME="cmt"></FIELD>
</PRE>

RADIO BUTTONS
=============

The radio button element could have exactly the same syntax as the
MENU list or for that matter LI or DIR.  Or even an attribute
RADIO on any of these existing ones?  Need a way of setting the  
default.

<RADIO>
<LI>Male
<LI DEFAULT>Female
</RADIO>

Lonnie Mandigo sums up the problem well. Looking at
Lonnie's diagram, the top box in the top box looks
like, in our case, the WWW network access library.
In the bottom of the box are the vt100 client and
X client boxes -- why not add Windows and Mac clients?
That is, you don't HAVE to have another line between
the network access bit and the display software, it can
all be linked into the same program. As it is for
most WWW clients.

The interesting bit is the line down from the top
box to the bottom box, and this is especially relevant
when it represents a phone line.  Then the top box
becomes a gateway between the internet protocols in all
their glory and a special phone line protocol.
Then, the bottom box (the user's software) and the
top box (gateway or internet-connected client)
are basically the same except with the internet access
code unplugged and the phoneline acess code plugged in.
As you say, the display and access code are separated.

The requirements or the phone line protocol are that
it should be efficient, it should allow long transfers
to be stopped at short notice to make way for new ones,
and it should, preferably, look ahead to guess what the
user might want next, and transfer it while he is reading
what he has got.   This would take advantage of a reasonable
amount of cache disk space on the user's machine, if he has
it.  The ideal is to keep the phone line humming as it is
the bottleneck. The user browses around, with an apparently
very good response time. All the scrolling and such is done
locally so that is instant.

There is not as far as I know any existing public protocol
which does this.   If anyone knows of one, please say!
If anyone wants to [form a group to] define and implement
one, then why not.  I see this as an important step
toward getting the internet information world out to
everyone in schools and homes.

Some guidelines would be useful here, e.g. can you nest OL or UL in the
DT glossary text in a DL list, or what about OL within UL within a DL list? 
What level of nesting should browsers aim to show effectively?

For formal presentation as an elective Internet standard we should aim to
be as precise as possible, e.g. via accurate DTD's and a range of examples.
I there enclose a DTD fragment with my proposal for forms.

> To kick off the discussion, I propose for the forms part the
> following

> FIELDS
> ======
> <FIELD NAME="f1" FIELDTYPE=TEXT MAXLEN=40>     </FIELD>

Tim, er did you receive my message with a detailed suggestion for forms?

My practical experience with building hypertext/forms based interfaces
for sales staff etc. has shown the value of:

    o   to be able to freely embed fields in other
        textural or graphical backgrounds

    o   the need for fields with constrained types
        e.g. dates, booleans, integer ranges, free text, ...

    o   the need to initialise fields with default values

    o   the ability to highlight fields as being in error

    o   the ability to disable the field to prevent further change

    o   the need for one-from-many AND many-from-many menus

    o   giving authors control over the realisation of such menus
        e.g. radio buttons, drop down, and permanently visible lists

Fields showing derived values, (e.g. a total figure in an expenses claim),
and arbitrary constraints between different fields can be handled by the
server. In this way you avoid can the need for a scripting language.

If the user sets a field to an incorrect value, the ability to highlight
the field makes it practical to draw the user's attention to that field
with the implication that its value should be changed. An accompanying
error message can be given as part of the surrounding text.

Similarly, it is often the case that given certain settings of fields, that
other fields cannot be changed. To make this obvious you should change the
appearence of these fields. In my browser, I show fields with a darker colour
when they accept input and the lighter window background colour when they are
read-only. Clicking the mouse over a read-only field has no effect.

As an author I want control over how a selection menu appears. When there are
few choices, radio buttons or lists work well. When there are lots of
selection fields it is strongly desirable to be able to use drop-down
selections, which appear in the body of the form as a button and a box
showing the currently selected value(s) for that field. Clicking on the
button causes the list of possible choices to appear, with the current
selection highlighted in some way.

Essentially we need two tags, one for input fields and one for selections.
These should be able to be placed freely with other HTML tags, so that you
could embed fields in a preformatted text if you need tight control over
the appearence. You could also put input and (dropdown) selection fields in
glossary lists.


Input Fields:
============

These fields have the following attributes:

    o   field name - used to identify the field's value to the server

    o   field type - boolean, text, date, uri, integer, float

    o   field width (optional) giving maximum length of field value

    o   field status (optional) ok (the default), in error, read-only

    o   initial value (optional)


Selection Fields:
================

These fields have the following attributes:

    o   field name - used to identify the field's value to the server

    o   field type - one-from-many or many-from-many

    o   field appearence (optional) radio, list, drop-down

    o   field status (optional) ok (the default), in error, read-only

The field appearence is a hint to the browser of how the author intends the
field to be displayed. For a drop-down field it would also be desirable to
be able to suggest the maximum size for displaying current selections,
particularly with many-from-many fields.

The set of possible choices can be specified as Tim points out with the
<LI> tag without the need for a new tag.

Here is my suggested DTD for the <input> and <select> tags. I prefer
these names as they seem more verb-like and appropriate than <field>
and <radio>.

<!-- INPUT tag

    o   The field name and type are required.

    o   The width, status and value attributes are optional.

    o   Boolean fields have values "yes" or "no"

    o   Date fields have values matching:

            "19th January 1992"
            "19 Jan 92"
            "19 Jan 92"
            "19/1/92"   with '/' or '-' as separators
            "1/19/92"

    o   URL fields have values corresponding to existing standards
        for universal resource locators

    o   values should be enclosed on "quotes"
-->

<!ELEMENT INPUT - O EMPTY>

<!ATTLIST INPUT
    name ID #REQUIRED
    type (boolean|text|date|url|integer|float) #REQUIRED
    width NUMBER "20"
    status (ok|error|frozen) "ok"
    value CDATA ""
>

<!-- SELECT tag

    o   The field name and type are required.

    o   The showas, width, status and value attributes are optional

    o   selected values are indicated with the LI tag
-->

<!ENTITY SELECT - - (LI)*>

<!ATTLIST SELECT
    name ID #REQUIRED
    type (single|multiple) #REQUIRED
    showas (radio|list|dropdown) "radio"
    width NUMBER "20"
    status (ok|error|frozen) "ok"
>

<!-- LI tag

    When the LI tag appears inside a <SELECT> ... </SELECT>
    the text following the LI tag is treated as a possible choice
    (up to the next LI tag or the terminating end-select tag).

    The LI tag is extended to indicate whether this alternatative
    has been selected or not, e.g.

        <LI SELECTED> versus <LI>

    Strictly speaking I am not sure if this is valid SGML, you should
    probably always give an attribute value as in <li selected=yes>
    but this seems excessive ...
-->    

<!ELEMENT LI - O EMPTY>

<!ATTLIST LI
    selected (yes|no) "no">

It also seems to me that we should revisit the specs for HTRQ and
the HTTP Mime headers to boost network performance via compression.

Are you familiar with the standard for Compressed TCP/IP Headers for
Low-Speed Serial Links, RFC1144? This cuts the headers down to an
average of 3 bytes and is both efficient and simple to implement
(about 250 lines of C). It was motivated by the need to get good
response times when using telnet over phone lines running from
300 to 19,200 bps. It is designed to increase line efficiency
while offering an under 200 millisecond response time for character
echo. For a 9600 bps line there is no point in increasing packet size
longer than 200 bytes. Increasing the maximum packet size to 576 bytes
increases the average delay by 188% while throughput increases by 3%.

The complete Berkely Unix implementation of cslip is available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.ee.lbl.gov as "cslip.tar.Z". I expect versions are
also available from PC software vendors, e.g. Distinct of Saratoga CA who
can be contacted at mktg@distinct.com (if not we should press them to
implement cslip right away!). Smart IP implementations also open and close
the phone line intelligently - so you don't hang onto an expensive long
distance line a moment longer than you need to.

The next step is to devise a www browser which offers look-ahead (under
user control via a preferences menu of course!). This would need to take
into account available resources (disk, memory, line costs) to decide which
references to prefetch. I, for one, would hate the browser to prefetch
megabytes of postscript and jpeg files! This shows the need to check file
size first using the appropriate methods, and underlines the need for
HTTP2 servers to supply a Length: field with document headers.

Finally www servers should offer compressed versions of documents. I have
looked through the MIME spec and the appropriate thing seems to be:

 a) documents are returned with an attribute specifying the kind
    of compression

        Content-Type: text/html; compression=Z
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8BIT

 b) Browsers can request compression with the HTRQ field

        Accept-Encoding: compression=Z

Where "Z" stands for the standard compress/uncompress utilities.
Some alternatives could be "z" for gzip, and "lzh", "zip" for the PC.

What do you think?

Subject: WWW Information Discovery Tools
Reply-To: jackson@stsci.edu

In comparing WWW vs Gopher and WAIS, I  admit
that WWW is a more powerful data representation model.

But, its ability to discover information is only as good as 
the links are and the links are made by hand.

Gopher and WAIS have global information discovery tools 
which know more than any one person does about available
resources, e.g.,

	WAIS's directory-of-servers
	Gopher's Veronica
	Gopher's ts/tb or jughead

and which are created by software.

Is anyone working on similar tools for WWW?

  Well, right now it would be pretty trivial to modify my emacs browser to
follow _every_ link it finds and record it.  Only problem would be in
keeping it from getting in an infinite loop, but that wouldn't be too hard.
Problem would be disk space & CPU time.

  Once I get the browser stable, I can work on something like this - unless
someone else wants to work on it in the meantime.  Might be more
stable/faster if written in C though. :)  But then what isn't?

  What type of format would the output have to be in?  It would be very
easy to spit out "URL :: TITLE" into a file.

Actually, my first answer was a little too cute for its own good.  The
real answer is that we (for one) are working on what could be termed
similar tools for wide-range hypermedia resource discovery, but it's
too early to tell how much we're going to be able to do or how it's
going to turn out, so there's not much else I can say about it at the
moment....

Unfortunately I don't think infinite loops is the only problem to be solved. 
For example we have databases of Physics Publications accessable via the web, 
and cross-referenced for citations. This databases contain ~300,000 entries. A 
robot, even if it is smart enough to not get into a loop, could spend many days 
roaming this one database trying to find all the entries. One way around that 
would be to have a list of places where the robot should not look, but finding 
this list would itself be a time consuming task. 

Conversly there are many interesting documents that can only be accessed by 
giving a keyword, making it difficult for a robot to discover these documents 
at all.

If anyone does solve the problems and generate a "URL :: TITLE" list (possibly 
a few other fields such as last modified date would be useful too) I would be 
happy to try to make the information available through the database we have 
interfaced to WWW.

Mapping out Web-space is harder than you think.
Not all infinite link chains are loops.  For example,
I have a WWW server that uses links to set search parameters,
so infinite sequences like the following are possible:

      Change maximum matches from 5 to: 2[1], 15[2], 30[3]
...
      Change maximum matches from 30 to: 5[1], 15[2], 40[3], 80[4]
...
      Change maximum matches from 80 to: 5[1], 40[2], 90[3], 180[4]

First of all -- the WAIS directory of servers differs from the others
in that Veronica and archie (which you didn't mention but should have)
are both automated.  Listing on the directory of servers is by
registration only -- the d.o.s doesn't search for machines that accept
connections at port 210 or anything like that.

The decision should be made whether we should have a registration
process for WWW -- a central page of servers that could then be fed to
a WWW version of archie/veronica to provide a list of titles/URLs.
Part of the registration process might be keeping track of the
"too-dense" sections and keeping the archie/veronica away from them.

The program should ...
: generate display of what it might look like through a browser
: reformat to tidy up the display
: remember internal links to use for link destinations
: have a couth directory browser in the load/save options
: have hotkeys for most everything 
: be able to insert predefined structures ("a list") which are

and see what problems it will run into these days.  I did discover or
think of and remedy the problems with a simple-minded approach that
were mentioned on the list this time.

[This is the message I intended to redisatribute to the list,
describing my roaming robot.  Maybe I should make the results of this
available as a searchable HTML document?  --Guido]

I have written a robot that does this, except it doesn't check for
valid SGML -- it just tries to map out the entire web.  I believe I
found roughly 50 or 60 different sites (this was maybe 2 months ago --
I'm sorry, I didn't save the output).  It took the robot about half a
day (a saturday morning) to complete.

There were several problems.

First, some sites were down and my robot would spend a considerable
time waiting for the connection to time out each time it found a link
to such a site.  I ended up remembering the last error from a site and
skipping sites that were obviously down, but there are many different
errors you can get, depending on whether the host is down,
unreachable, doesn't run a WWW server, doesn't recognize the document
address you want, or has some other trouble (some sites were going up
and down while my robot was running, causing additional confusion).

Next, more importantly, some sites have an infinite number of
documents.  There are several causes for this.

First, several sites have gateways to the entire VMS documentation (I
have never used VMS but apparently the VMS help system is a kind of
hypertext).  While not exactly infinite the number of nodes is *very*
large.  Luckily such gateways are easily recognized by the kind of
pathname they use, and VMS help is unlikely to contain pointers to
anything except more VMS help, so I put in a simple trap to stop
these.

Next, there are other gateways.  I can't remember whether I
encountered a Gopher or WAIS gateway, but these would have even worse
problems.

Finally, some servers contain bugs that cause loops, by referencing to
the same document with an ever-growing path.  (The relative path
resolving rules are tricky, and I was using my own www client which
isn't derived from Tim's, which made this more severe, but I have also
found occurrences reproducible  with the CERN www client.)

Although I didn't specifically test for bad HTML, I did have to parse
the HTML to find the links, and found occasional errors.  I believe
there are a few binaries, PostScript and WP files that have links to
them, which take forever to fetch.  There were also various
occurrences of broken addresses here and there -- this was a good
occasion for me to debug my www client library.

If people are interested, I could run the robot again and report a
summary of the results.

I also ran a gopher robot, but after 1600 sites I gave up...  The
Veronica project in the Gopher world does the same and makes the
results available as a database, although the last time I tried it the
veronica server seemed too overloaded to respond to a simple query.

If you want source for the robots, the're part of the Python source
distribution: ftp to ftp.cwi.nl, directory, pub/python, file
python0.9.8.tar.Z.  The robot (and in fact my entire www and gopher
client library) is in the tar archive in directory python/demo/www.
The texinfo to html conversion program that I once advertized here is
also there.  (I'm sorry, you'll have to built the python interpreter
from the source before any of these programs can be used...)
Note that my www library isn't up with the latest HTML specs, this is
a hobby project and I neede my time for other things...

Subject: Resource discovery and the Web

Folks:
     Lawyers and legal scholars have for several years now used
advanced resource discovery tools called 'research assistants' and
'librarians'. While these are also prone to going into infinite loops,
they do incorporate fairly sophisticated natural-language recognition
capability and are marginally cheaper to develop and maintain than software ;-).

     Seriously, though, there are important aspects of resource
discovery best left to humans, considerations like 'relevance to task
at hand' and 'degree of relatedness to present document holdings' and
'reputation of source author'.  Of course, leaving these things to
human judgment means that you have to be at least slightly willing to
accept the judgment of the human involved...and that you probably want
that human to have at least some automated tools.

    What has in fact emerged in our field is an informal system of
registration similar to what someone proposed in an earlier message.
At the moment, there are two sites which maintain Net 'kiosks'
focussed on legal information (ours and Washington and Lee).  One of
these (ours) maintains a mailing list which is solely for the purpose
of communicating the discovery of or need for new Net-based legal
information. There are also a couple of well-known lists for
legal-tech and law-library people on which such offers and needs
appear regularly.  Also important to us -- but not yet in place -- is
a system for registering 'works in progress'.  Much of what is most
useful to us at present involves marking up existing public-domain
documents of some size (say the Internal Revenue Code); there is a
rather limited set of documents involved and everyone in the field
would I imagine prioritize them in roughly the same way, so there is a
great chance of duplication of effort if work-in-progress is not
communicated in some way.

Might we not do the same thing for the Web?  I plan to put together a
'law page' roughly paralleling what we've done with our Gopher site
soon, and put it together in such a way that it could be partitioned
off to other sites and other editors by sub-field as it grows.  To be
truthful, I'm also anxious to pass off the maintenance of this
information to others with more substantive legal expertise as quickly
as possible. I'm even less capable of judging the quality of legal
information than I am of writing software, and moreover I get paid to
do software...

Regards,
Tb.

Subject: httpd-2.03, puzzle

I've been using the httpd-0.9 daemon on a Sun running SunOS 4.1.3.  I
need to run the daemon on another platform for which only httpd-2.x
daemons are available, so I thot I'd give that revision level a try on
the Sun.  I tried both the 2.02 & 2.03 daemons on the Sun.  I can't
get them to do anything useful.  Here's is what the daemon tells me :

Daemon: net read returned 28, errno=0 New anchor 24040 has hash 76 and
address `/var/adm/www/test.html' HTAccess: loading document
/var/adm/www/test.html HTFile: can't stat //WWW///var/adm/www/test.html
FTP: Looking for /var/adm/www/test.html HTTPAccess: Can't find internet

Error 13 in `errno' after call to FTP file load() failed. Permission denied
Daemon: Socket 0 disconnected by peer

This is the real address of the document on the daemon's file system:
/var/adm/www/test.html

Why did it manufacture this garbage? : //WWW///var/adm/www/test.html

I looked at the source code for 2.02 but it didn't seem to match
up with what I saw happening, or else (or also) I didn't understand it.
Perhaps it's irrelevant, because I couldn't get this material to
compile so it is probably not what was used to compile the
daemon binaries available.  I also couldn't find anything in the
online documentation that differed from the treatment of the
earlier httpd.

This is the map file I used:
map / /test.html
map /*  /var/adm/www/*
pass /var/adm/www/*
fail *

I have this in /etc/httpd.conf also.

Any advice?  If you respond, please cc me directly, I'm not sure
I'm on this mailing list yet.

Hi,
  I just joined this list and can't seem to access the archives at
http://eies2.njit.edu:80/wmail.html.  So, I don't know what's been
discussed recently.  Where else can I find the archives?
  I'm interested in HTML/SGML authoring tools.  Can we have an update
on the status of any X11-based editor?  We would like to start
generating HTML and are evaluating which course is the best to take.
We could buy a NeXTStep machine, or Framemaker for our Suns.  But
it would really be great if we had an X11-based editor on a par with
Xmosaic.  I may be able to find the time to contribute to such an
effort.  How about it, Marc?  What's the prognosis?
  What about commercial SGML authoring systems such as ArborText?  Is
anyone out there using them?  Does anyone have anything good/bad to
say about any of them?
  One project we are considering getting started on is integrating the
Z39.50 information retrieval protocol into WWW.  We're a library and
Z39.50 is becoming *very* important to us.  Z39.50, by the way, is
essentially the protocol used by WAIS (with a few caveats).  I have
yet to take a close look at the WWW-WAIS gateway code.  Comments?
  Finally, in http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/www-overview.html, TBL
says 
    HTML is eventually going to be a real ``standard''; by
    the time that happens, it should be fully SGML-compliant.
What does "real" mean in this context?  Which standards organization(s)
are involved?

We'd like to do it, but we have all kinds of things on our plate right
now and not enough people/time to do them all.  So it's hard to say
when the editor is going to move far enough up the "important todo"
list to be given time and energy, if the current situation holds
(i.e., if nobody dumps a pile of money on our laps).

Mosaic has to speak Z39.50 sometime this year -- again, not sure when,
though -- and we're hoping it will be done for us (i.e., in the client
library) but if not we'll probably put work into it.

Probably the Internet RFC process (?), which would make it a
"standard" on a roughly equivalent footing with the format of Internet
mail messages, or MIME, or the FTP protocol, or anything else defined
by an RFC.

This looks great....I've put a copy on:

http://slacvx.slac.stanford.edu:80/misc/internet-services.html

which I will try to keep up-to-date with Nat's original (which version of 
the WWW server supports automatic mirroring??). This should give faster 
access, (at least for those in the US).

The www command line client has the command
 www -source http://slacvx.slac.stanford.edu:80/misc/internet-services.html
which can be used for mirroring.  Redirect the output to a file.

The http protocol has no notion of file dates or sizes, so it's not
entirely suitable for the sorts of optimizable automatic mirroring
that packages like lmjm@src.doc.ic.ac.uk's "mirror" uses; if bytes
across a link are precious and you want to mirror a site behind that
link putting the files out in ftp-land is to date the only efficient
way to go.

There's another version of this available from the Indiana University
home page which Tom Loos put together a while back, but I think it's
current.  The URL is http://cs.indiana.edu/internet/internet.html for
the main list.  I keep meaning to make it searchable via a keywork
index one of these days.

By the way, I notice that the Internet services list in Stanford has
links to a finger entry at Berkeley which goes via a WWW-finger
gateway in New Zealand.  This seems rather inefficient, to say the
least.  There is also a finger gateway (which I consider cool, since
it includes graphical support from faces) on our server which people
in the states might consider.  Look in
http://cs.indiana.edu/finger/gateway for information on it.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]

A new version of Lynx is now available at acs220.cc.ukans.edu
for anonymous ftp.

If you don't know what Lynx is try telneting to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu
and logging in as 'www' for a demo.

Revisions 7 is mostly a large group of bug fixes, but there is
also a new feature to allow you to turn on link numbering, so
Lynx can look alot like the line mode browser. (Wow! :)

Support for VMS is greatly increased.
Big thanks to Foteos Macrides and Selden E. Ball, Jr. for all the VMS
bug reports and fixes.

Binaries are also available for AIX, Ultrix, SUN, and VMS.

On a completely different note:
I have also put up a test gateway to read Lynx internal format 
documents.  Our entire CWIS and the WWW Demo pages are now
accessable through this gateway.  

The University of Kansas CWIS is at:
 http://acs220.cc.ukans.edu:8002/cwis.screen
The WWW demo start page is at:
 http://acs220.cc.ukans.edu:8002/www.start
    
The data server will move to a more permanent machine in a couple of
weeks.

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).
  DEC Ultrix.

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working
binaries, or development systems, are welcome.)  Documentation is
available online.

Changes since 0.12 include:

 o Fixed occasional mysterious coredump in startup routines. 
 o Fixed occasional stupid coredump in freeing document text. 
 o Fixed silly coredump on accessing malformed URLs like
   ftp:/tcp/xxx.yyy.zzz.www. 
 o Fixed URL parsing choke on accessing URL 'test.html#foobar' as
   an initial program argument. 
 o Added system() call error reporting. 
 o Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
   underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline
   for visited. 
 o Jumping from 2nd+ document page to 1st document page in a
   single document via anchors works now. 
 o Various glitches with scrollbars, document pages, etc. fixed. 
 o New toggle-button options (caseless, backwards) in File->Search
   window. 
 o File->Search doesn't put search results on top line of window. 
 o Use of -l flag for rlogins restored. 
 o Built-in finger interface with faces support (thanks, Marc V of
   IU!). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

Thanks as usual to everyone who's been contributing comments and bug
reports -- keep 'em coming!

Subject: Plans for cello MS-Windows client

Folks:

A considerable degree of mystery has surrounded the development of the
Cello Windows browser.  Here's some information - and a kind-of,
sort-of schedule - which I hope will help some of you who have been
curious about it.

Capabilities:

As presently constructed, Cello works directly as a WWW, gopher, FTP,
and Telnet client in much the same way as XMosaic does.  The terminal
emulation for the Telnet client is, for the moment, restricted to ANSI
emulation, but this will either be improved to support more
sophisticated features in future or else hooks will be added to permit
you to run your own Windows Telnet.

Tagset support includes all of the current WWW tags excepting more
nebulous, contemplated tags like <BLOCKQUOTE>.  Text attribute tags
(<STRONG>, <B>, <I>, <U>, etc are supported).  <OL> is supported.
Diacritical and national characters are not supported, but will be
soon up to the limits of the Windows ANSI character set.

Gopher+ is not currently supported but will be in a future version.

NNTP support is in development.

In addition, Cello supports post-processing of any and all files for
which the user configures an association-by-filename-extension in the
WIN.INI file.  For all practical purposes, this means that out-of-line
viewing of graphics files and out-of-line listening to audio files are
currently supported provided that 1) the user has an appropriate app
installed for the file-extension as given in the URL and 2)the URL
uses a file:// scheme.  (For example, I can't get at Marc's Internet
Talk Radio files; the http:// access scheme in their URL's causes
Cello to assume that they're in HTML format -- is this a bad thing?
should I have a way of handling this?).
I can play .au files, though.

This last gets a little tricky in terms of .Z and .zip and the
handling of other compressed files. Cello is not too bright about
handling these -- it happily will decompress them, and then has no
idea what to display.  How are others handling this?

I also hope to develop a URL scheme and code for handling DDE and OLE
linking by the time of the first release.  Anyone have any suggestions
about what the URL for such things ought to look like?

Internals (library):

At present Cello uses very little of the WWW common library.  This is
in part a product of the difficulty of porting into the Windows
environment, and in part a product of my laziness in understanding the
common code architecture.  This can and probably will change in future
versions, with NNTP support as a 'trial balloon' in that direction.

The GUI internals are about half Windows-API-direct and half Borland
ObjectWindows. Coding is C++.  No release of source code is
contemplated.

Internals(TCP/IP):

At present Cello uses a commercial TCP/IP stack from the Distinct
Corporation.  The coding from my end will be converted to Winsock
compliance prior to beta release, but I am cynical about what 'Winsock
compliance' means at this stage.  For that and a few other reasons we
will obtain an unlimited runtime license from Distinct which will
permit us to distribute their stack to academic institutions at no
cost to the end user for one year.  After that, we'll see.  The
Distinct package does offer some useful features, such as SLIP and PPP
support and dialling, which we would like to keep around.


Plans:

So far as progress and dates are concerned, here's the plan:

As matters stand:

-- NNTP is not yet implemented, and will be prior to beta release.
-- Terminal emulation is in the process of being cleaned up.
-- HTML is stable -- at least until the next round of improvements is
put in .
-- I have about 3,412,345 minor user interface changes/improvements to
make.


All this argues for a limited beta release around 1 May, with general
availability around 1 June and something stable enough to call a
'version' by July 15.

Overarching concerns:

The LII is a garage shop primarily interested in the distribution of
law-related information over the Web.  We are not a full-blown
software shop...and for that reason some of this probably will seem a
bit fluky/nebulous to a number of you.  Dates will probably slip, and
some features will be slow in coming....and I'm afraid it's the best I
can do for all of you who have already shown interest in a 'vaporware'
product.   Do keep those cards and letters coming -- I need feedback
and suggestion on features and implementation (though some things may
not happen right away).  We could also use money (grin).

Regards,

Tb.

Yes, I'd like to try it. But, alas, no client.  I went looking to find out
if the MacWWW beta client had progressed to another version (the old
one doesn't allow you to point anywhere other than CERN) but not only could
I NOT find anything new, the old version of the software seems to have
disappeared as well.  Have you heard anything on the WWW discussion groups

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]


Last week there was quite a bit of talk about traversing the Web
to compile a list of all Web documents.

I have tweeked my traversal program a little for WWW documents
and it looks like it will work.

The traversal program only attempts to follow http: links and
keeps a list of all links as they are traversed.  

The question I have now is:  Should I run it?  I'm not entirely
sure what it will do.  It will certainly put a big load on
the network.  Will it get bogged down in some incredibly dense
subtree?  What day of the week would be the best time to run?

Currently the URL, Document Title and the link name that referenced
the document are saved in a Tab delimiter format.  Are there
any tabs in document titles?

What does everyone else think?

Is anyone interested in writing an HTML to postscript program??

There may already exist some SGML to postscript programs so
the job might not be too hard.  How about any of you
Postscript wizards that are hiding out there?

I would like to use this as a print filter for Lynx.  And I'm
sure Marc Andreessen would like to use one as well!

I have an HTML to LaTeX program (better IMHO than the sed script
available from CERN).  I will upload the latest version to NCSA as
html2latex-0.9b.tar.Z.

It handles:
 -- bold, italics, etc
 -- sections, subsections
 -- titling and authorship
 -- numbering or non-numbering the sections
 -- automatic table-of-contentsing

It doesn't know about;
 -- <DL COMPACT>

In the future, I *might* write an HTML style for LaTeX.  Maybe.
Possibly.  Hmmm.

The NCSA Mosaic 0.13 Sun binary that was available on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries as xmosaic-sun up until
5 minutes ago was linked to Sun's libresolv.a, which is necessary for
Suns not running DNS and does not *usually* screw up Suns running DNS,
but does screw up a large enough (non-zero) percentage of Suns running
DNS that it is now apparent to Yours Truly that I can't just make
available a single Sun binary and expect it to work on all Suns on the
network.  Bummer.

The upshot is that there are now two Sun binaries available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sun
file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sun-lresolv

If you picked up a copy of the previous xmosaic-sun 0.13 binary and it
didn't work for you, please pick up a copy of the new xmosaic-sun
binary and try it out (and if it still doesn't work, please yell at
me).

Sorry for the confusion,

We all know that it has been WAISified, but now it has been HTMLated

later).  The software (simple and easy to use) to build this HTMLated
version of the thesaurus will be available from NCSA's FTP site as
roget-dist-1.1.tar.Z some time.

It can be tested out *in the meantime* as
	http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gutenberg/roget/home.html
but I urge you to make your own local version of the database, or to
wait for someone closer to you to do so.  As I've said before, we get
it in the wallet for each connection, and the index is 44K.

When Marc moves it from incoming,

It's over at info.cern.ch... I don't think it has passed alpha yet.
It's be nice if we had something like Xmosaic for the MAC. Xmosaic

As marc says, you can certainly run a wais index on
the data you serve up with w3, and serve up that index
as a w3 server.  Just look at the famous unix manual pages
in the mosaic menu ... that is indexed hypertext.
You don't have to use the wais indexing tool, of course, you
could use anything.

Now we're talking indexes across servers.

I agree there is a need for an index of resources.  I think a few  
people are thinking of it, but as far as I know there isn't one yet,  
and while that is the case, there is an opening for someone who
would like to put together a quick hack on the public WAIS code
with www as front end.  Contributions please!  Using www to collect  
the data for indexing means that the same indexer would be able to
run over not only native w3 servers, butalso anything else (wais,  
gopher, etc) which it was pointed at, and the result would be an
index which would cover all these forms.  This would be really  
useful, as one doesn't  in general know what sort of a server has
the data one wants. So the new index will INCLUDE the directory
of servers and veronica.  All on one swell foop.  Anyone going to
go for it?

Subject: New Version of The Emacs Browser For W3 (.04b)

Hello All,
  
   This is to announce yet another version of my WWW browser for emacs.  It
supports Epoch, Lucid, and vanilla emacs.  Lucid&Epoch support fonts and
highlighting.  The Epoch version now supports graphics (bitmaps, gifs,
group3 faxes, raster, X window-dumps, X icons, graymaps, PICT, MacPaint
files, and Targa files) - this requires that Epoch was compiled with
HAVE_XPM defined, and also needs the pbmplus package (or some other way to
convert the images into an XPixMap that epoch can understand).  It also
supports all tags except for news links.  The Lucid Emacs now supports
setting the fonts for headers, etc in your .Xresources file.

    The package is available via anonymous ftp from moose.cs.indiana.edu in
/pub/elisp/w3.  Get the w3.tar.Z file if you are upgrading from an earlier
version.  Get w3.tar.Z & extras.tar.Z if this is the first time.
extras.tar.Z contains:

  Here is an excerpt of the changelog file since the last release:
Tue Apr 13 08:30:58 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.04b
* Fixed graphic support to work over http links (Epoch Only)

Mon Apr 12 07:35:40 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.03b
* Fixed lemacs support so it doesn't nuke your xdefaults.  Also fixed
  the passing of face-objects, since they are screen-specific, and
  therefore a Bad Thing.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski (jwz@lucid.com)
* Changed menu code so that it put the link # in there also.  Helpful
  for when the links are unnamed, or named 'here' or 'this'.  Thanks
  to Jamie Zawinski (jwz@lucid.com) for saying the menus were hosed.

Sun Apr 11 16:30:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed graphics support for epoch - would only do 1 image per page.
* Fixed a few typos - thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu

Fri Apr  9 00:18:47 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added graphics support for epoch (doesn't work over http, pretty

  eostrom@nic.gac.edu
* Fixed telnet handling - thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu for noticing
  it and for a preliminary fix.  Refined his fix.  Problem was that
  telnet wasn't getting enough time to start before I sent it a
  command.
* Fixed a few regular expressions - thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu
* Fixed bug in w3-add-document-hotlist which caused an error if the
  hotlist file didn't already exist.  Thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu
  for noticing it.

As more public domain hypertext comes on line, we are going to need
some big disks on each continent for it.  We should also perhaps use
some mirroring software to keep them up to date.

One possibility is we feed back the hypertext to Michael Hart.
It could just be an overlay of files which have pointers to
the actual text, or a smart server which can #include the
actual text into a wrapper document.

Nat, do you thing the Gutenberg project would consider
using their existing distribution chain for the stuff? We could
set up W3 servers on some of their machines maybe?  It would
take less CPU than FTP.

   Are there any plans to have an html tag to include a file?  That way you
wouldn't have to depend on a server being smart enough to include the file.
Something akin to the IMG tag now.  ie: <INCLUDE SRC="XXXXXX">, and
possibly <INCLUDE SRC="HTTP://fqdn:80/XXXXXX">.

I see a problem coming here: how does an unreplicated document (say my
own home page) mane a reference to such a replicated document?  If I
have a reference to the closest replica, a user far away who follows
such a link will get pointed to the replica closest to *me*, not
closest to her.

Some possible solutions:

- a translation scheme whereby clients "know" (e.g. from a local
configuration file that may be updated automatically as mirror sites
are added) that information at host X is identical to info at host Y

- a magic string in hostnames that is translated dependent on the
geographical position of the client (e.g.
http://info-cern.closestmirror/...)

- upon first contact with a server, it might respond with "please
try the following mirror site which is closer to you" (this could be
put in HTTP2 I suppose).

This is a real problem with embedding location information in URLs...

I have been interested for months.  Unfortunately, with my work load,
I'll likely continue to be interested for many more months.

On the other hand, I already have postscript that formats a string into
a paragraph.  That's one of the major hurtles.  If there's another
postscript wizard out there that wants to try it, let me know and I'll
send you that bit of code.

Also, the recently posted (comp.sources.postscript) "textpro" text
manipulation functions might come in handy if going directly to PostScript
(includes super- and subscripts, multiple fonts & sizes, centering and
right alignment, and full justification as well as functions to permit
printing of characters precisely centered on the current point,...)

Subject: Integrating Email into WWW?

A thought that just occurred to me (I'm new on this list, so this may
already have been discussed and/or dismissed...). 

The basic idea of WWW is to integrate all existing and new Internet
services: FTP, Gopher, WAIS, Newsgroups, etc. I haven't heard anything yet
about integrating email, though. WWW documents regularly contain links to
people, presenting an address, email address and perhaps more info on the
persons activities and affiliations. But these are just passive data. It
would be interesting if I read an interesting document that I could
directly contact the author without leaving my WWW browser. 

One intuitive way to implement this would be that if I select the person's
name (or email address) I would get a dialogue in which I can compose an
email message. This might follow the same conventions as the "forms" which
were discussed here recently: fields for "Subject:", "To: (by default
already filled in with the email address", "From: (default my own
address"), "Text:", etc. The idea is that sending an email message or
request to a person is not basically different from sending a query to a
database server (the main difference being that the person may be even
slower and more unreliable when it comes to getting the answer one would
like to have). 

Of course, this implies that the appropriate email protocol (SMTP?) would
be incorporated in HTTP. But that can remain hidden from the user. 

A similar interface could be written for mailing lists (like www-talk),
bringing them on the  same footing as the already existing interface to
Newsgroups...

Sounds like it's time to move URN's (or whatever persistent Internet
resource identifiers are being called these days) out of the theory
stage and into practice.... anyone know what the status of the URN
work that was/is apparently going somewhere in the IETF?

This would be very nice.  Along those same lines, the Lynx stuff from the 
University of Kansas has the interesting concept of file "ownership".  A special
tag gives the email address of the owner of the file, and the hypertext
browsers allow you to send them mail.  This is really a subset of the idea
proposed above, but it might be useful to have that concept of ownership
without any explicit reference in the text.

Couldn't the various browsers just use the existing mail delivery mechanisms
and programs?

Is multi-media electronic mail around the corner?

If I come across an interesting picture, piece of music, or
other non-text document in the Web, I'd like to be able to
attach that to an e-mail message and send it to a colleague.

Or, how about only embedding the identifier for the document
into the e-mail message, leaving it upto the mail-reading
client software at the recipient's host to parse the
identifier, track down the document on the Internet, and
present it to the user in a way that is reasonable for his
desktop environment?

Yes.  It's called MIME.  There's a nice friedly guide to it available;
the URL is file://ftp.uu.net/networking/mail/mime/mime.ps and
obviously it's in postscript.  The real specs are in RFC 1341.

Our university is about to start installing some sort of a CWIS.  It will
almost surely be using existing software, with little new being developed
here.  The powers that be think it best to give the users a menu-based
system such as gopher or freenet.

I am arguing for a hypertext approach.  I know that because of all
the gateways and compatibilities that exist, almost any information
provider is accessible from almost any user interface.  Still, the hypertext
concept is a style of user interface that is usable with the lowest technology
(terminals on 2400 baud lines) but extends far further on better technology.
I'm not sure that my obviously wise [:-)] arguments are having enough effect.

If anyone has been through similar exercises and has some winning arguments,
and doesn't mind taking a few minutes to share them, I would be eternally
grateful.  My arguments for are:
	1. There is as much software available for that as any other approach
		(the web and/or lynx, for example).
	2. Other kinds of providers (WAIS, gopher, etc.) are still usable.
	3. The user interface with VT100 terminal emulators and 2400 baud
	   lines are just as good.
	4. They give you a much richer system with only a very slightly
	   more complex user interface.
	5. The user interface is MUCH better when you can move to higher
	   transfer rates and more local power.
	6. They will change to a hypertext concept in 3 or 4 years
  	   anyway.  Might just as well start that way.

We're trying out a system at PARC that has a similar problem.  Our
tentative solution, translated to URL terms, is that one particular
scheme of URL is a list of URL's, any of which can be used to access the
document.  This would allow the client to use whichever copy of the
document it ``decides'' is closest/cheapest.  We also have different URL
schemes that allow us to say, ``look up this UID in a name-service of
this type'' -- indirection.

I have been annoyed by the lack of CSO support in WWW clients
so I decided to try and write a CSO gateway. 

I sort of succeded and I sort of failed.

The only way that I could figure out how to make it work was
to rewrite the Gopher CSO link to be more friendly to a gateway.
This may or may not work to implement this in WWW.

Anyways, a breif explanation and a demo are in

"file://acs220.cc.ukans.edu/pub/cso.html"

or for those who don't read URLs that means it is available by
anonymous ftp from acs220.cc.ukans.edu in /pub as cso.html.

Tell me what you think!

From reading the stuff Michael Hart has written, and the arguments in
the GUTNBERG mailing list, I'd be surprised if they'd go for this.  They
seem to be interested in providing only plain ASCII files, and nothing
else.  I don't want people to think I am criticising them, they are doing
a wonderful job, but they tend to stick to ASCII only.

(that's not to say it's not worth a go :-)

If we were to adopt it, then the we should use the SGML entity  
scheme. Basically, this involves declaring a new entity
(thing which is inserted with a &   sign) as being an
external object with a given URL, and then making a reference
to that entity.  But we're talking about something slightly different
from what I was suggesting, in that the these tags or entities
would be picked up by the client, whereas I was thinking
of something implemented on the server which would be
invisible to the client.  It would be faster that way, and not
require any extensions either, like you could do it tomorrow with cpp
for example.

A list of URL's might work in some cases, but in general this means
that adding a new mirror site requires updating all references...

A name service sounds like a better solution -- bot how to integrate
this in HTML or HTTP?  And who's going to run the name service?  Or
could we use some existing name service?  (Perhaps DNS is flexible
enough to return a list of hosts for certain names, from which the
client could choose?  This would be ideal.  Anyone know anything about
DNS?)

Oops!   I did the same thing a year or so back, and Scott has been
keeping the HTML up to date.  It is currently in
http://info.cern.chl/hypertext/DataSources/Yanoff.html
which has links from the "Information by type of server" page,
under telnet sites, as that is mostly what it is.

I suggest anyone who wants a local copy get onto Scott's mailing list
for the new releases of the hypertext version.  


Perhaps, Tony, you could keep a definitive version.  Scott doesn't  
seem to use any WWW tool himself and so sometimes it is necessary to  
check out the HTML and tweak a few typos with each release. Nathan,  
you might find that you want to improve the look of it and feed it  
back to Scott.

(Of course the ideal thing would be to persuade Scott to run a server
and serve it from source, if he has access to a reliable machine)

If anyone does end up serving this, let me know and I will stop
and update my pointers.

I assume you mean  ^^^^ HTTP.

I haven't made a deadline, but one thing is imperitive, and that is
that any existing server or database which falls over given a third  
word on the HTTP request line MUST be upgraded immediately. These
servers are just buggy.  (mea culpa, I know!)

I notice that although new gopher servers seem to handle HTTP,
they treat any thirs word as a search term (instead of extracting
it from a ?xx+yy+zz suffix on the URL) and so break on full HTTP.

I have just fixed the techinfo gateway.

Yes, DNS already has a facility to allow for multiple machines to be
considered capable of providing some service, either mail exchange (MX)
or providing the names of servers which can identify a host.

MX records are probably closest to what you want, since they allow for
multiple machines to be specified as mail exchange hosts with weighting
for the preferred and non-preferred hosts.

There are also Well Known Service (WKS) descriptions for hosts (e.g. ftp,
telnet, etc...) which would be analagous to advertising WWW, WAIS, Gopher,
etc..

Perhaps someone should begin thinking about this & working
with the people who work on the DNS standards.  I'm not
sure WKS is used for much of anything & whether every implementation
can deal with it -- it never caut on.  Maybe a new kind of
record is needed, analogous to MX records, an IX record for
information exchangers?

Subject: WAIS databases as first class WWW objects
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 93 16:37:15 EDT
From: Edward Vielmetti <emv@garnet.msen.com>

I'd like to see WAIS databases treated as first class objects in WWW.

For instance URLs like
	wais://wais.msen.com:210/reuters?
to define a database, and
	wais://wais.msen.com:210/reuters?communications
to define a search.

This probably involves moving code from the www-to-wais gateway into
the client library, or having "smart" clients go off and use 
"full featured" wais clients when they are presented with serviers.

The next step of this is to take the wais directory of servers and
add value to it by writing a .src->.html converter that makes things
look really nice.

Yes, and in addition, it means that choosing an appropriate URL is up to
some client heuristics.  However, it does have the merit of not
requiring a round-trip conversation with the name service, which is
important to us.  I think the suggestion of having some kind of
meta-URL, which could be interpreted locally, would also merit more
thought.  Some sort of macrology like imake uses (ugh :-).  This would
solve some of the problems of a static list, without necessarily
requiring name service round trips.

I prefer the move into the client library, myself.  It would be
exceptionally simple to do -- just steal some of the code from the
existing gateway and munge munge munge.

Yes!  Yes!  Such a converter should:
 o recognise news.group.format
 o recognise anonymous:/ftp/references
 o recognise maintainer@e-mail.addresses

Hmm, there must be more -- if that were all, I could do it with sed
commands:

s/([A-Za-z0-9-\.])+/<A HREF="news:\1">\1<\/A>/
s/([A-Za-z0-9-\.]+)(:?/?)([A-Za-z0-9-\.\/]+)/<A HREF="file:\/\/\1\/\3">\1\2\3<\/A>/
s/([A-Za-z0-9-\.]+@[A-Za-z0-9-\.])/<ADDRESS>\1<\/ADDRESS>/

Subject: beginner's guide to html
X-Md4-Signature: 50d5b075c9d77da5dd47846dbb937798

In response to assorted requests and queries, I have written a simple
"Beginner's Guide" to writing documents in HTML.  It's up for grabs at
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html at the moment;
comments are welcome (but no complaints about my coverage or use of
the IMG tag that Mosaic supports; it's important internally).  

The guide also points to a rudimentary primer on URL's that might be
of interest to Web beginners (certainly the number of people who have
sent me Mosaic bug reports saying "URL 'machine.com' doesn't connect
to the ftp server", etc., would seem to indicate that basic knowledge
of URL's is not yet a given on the net).

Cheers,
Marc

Yes, this is possible with the 2.0 library.  The line mode client
doesn't have the command line option yet, but the client library
can use a rule file, just like a server.

This has been discussed, in fact having a host name which translates
info many IP addresses -- all the apparatus is there already in DNS
and most people say it won't break anything, we just need code to, if
DNS returns >1 IP address, ping them all to get the closest and  
remember which one it is.

This is already the HTTP2 spec.  The reply field can be a "forward"
reply containing a pointer to the real object.  That is, HTTP2  
servers can be used as name servers.  No code yet in the library.
See http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html#z9

I thought it was going to get closer, but basically it was agreed  
that the format urn:publisher/id would work with a finite number of

putting some code together???

Remember that if you have to contact a name server every time,
you slow things down anyway. Basically, a little common sense 

in the client would guess that a related document was avalable from
the same server as last time.

Why is avoiding a name server roundtrip important to you?  There's one
anyway in links of this type (the hostnames that it links to).  I
wouldn't think these roundtrips were very expensive?  (I never relly
notice delays around here.)

IMHO, URLs should have the same sort of status as numeric IP address -
a low-level format that must be agreed on by all, but essentially
invisible to end-users. I include WWW administrators among "end-users";
they don't need to be Unix/IP wizards to manage a few HTML docs and a
couple of databases. Certainly translating a "normal" FTP reference to
a URL is NOT fun for most users. URLs should be hidden behind DNS, just
like numeric IP addresses. I applaud the notion of a MX style record as
a start at least.

I did ask some time ago if Xmosaic could have a simple FTP window, to
prompt the user for a hostname (optionally dir/file name, username and
password) - maybe you'd get less false bug reports if you built it in,
Marc. I really do think that XMosaic would become very popular as a
value-added replacement FTP client.

Also, I would like to see a DNS and/or Hesiod URL registered, so that I
can get info directly from DNS/Hesiod in the same way as X500 or any
other service. Far more useful than an AFS URL, Tim.

Folks:

Let me add my vote to Neil's in favor of an smtp:// scheme. I was in
fact on the verge of adding some such thing unilaterally to Cello (as
part of the support for CSO that Lou wants, as it happens).  I had in
mind something like:

    smtp://someone@somewhere/Subject:optional header line/...

with possibly any number of header lines following delimited by
slashes...

Are there better ways?

X-Envelope-To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch

(If there's a better forum for discussion of URLs, let me know.)

At the Gopher conference this Monday, a few people tried to convince
the UMN Gopher team to alter Gopher+ to use URLs.  (I wasn't one of
them, but I agreed.)  Having done a little hacking today on the
gopher-handling part of w3.el, though, I'm wondering about the
interaction of two facts:

>The path is interpreted in a manner dependent on the protocol being used.
>However, when it contains slashes, these must imply a hierarchical structure.
(from the URL spec)

but the Gopher protocol insists on the opacity of selector strings.
That is, if a Gopher selector string is "fumble/foo/.././bar/../baz", it
is *just that*, not "fumble/baz", which URL interpreters would come up
with.

I think this could be gotten around by quoting slashes in the path
part of a URL, although I'm not quite sure where the unquoting takes
place, so this might not work.  However, this seems unnecessary to me.
I guess what I want to ask is, why is any URL that contains a slash
forced into a hierarchical interpretation?  I would prefer that
specific schemes (http, ftp, afs, prospero?) be classified as
hierarchical, and hierarchy-based translations be limited to those
schemes.  New schemes, as they appear, can specify whether or not they
follow the standard hierarchical-structure rules.

This implies, of course, that if a client isn't familiar with a given
scheme, of course, it can't know whether or not to perform
translations on URLs in that scheme.  I'm not convinced that this is a
bad thing--if a program doesn't understand an address, it can just
pass it off to another program (e.g., a gateway) that does.

So, what am I overlooking?  I realize this would require clients to
store an additional piece of information for each scheme (hierarchical
bit), but this doesn't seem like a great cost to me in exchange for
some opacity of paths.

Right, and consulting a name-server every time would double the
round-trips.  It can also involve TCP setup around here, and process
context switches with your application (yep, every machine runs a local
name server).  All expensive -- and we're trying to keep our objects
light-weight.

Why worry about this Erik - the slashes in gopher are as hierarchical as 
in any other protocol and DO refer to the location in the directory structure.

OTOH - it is possible in the URL spec to define an opaque selector, and I
believe that the gopher one is defined that way.

Subject: some XMosaic questions

Figured I'd try here first...

1)  How does one fetch a binary or postscript file to a local file,
using XMosaic?  My postscript viewer doesn't let me save the viewed file
to another file...

2)  Has anyone put together a set of Emacs-style keybindings for the
Motif widgets?  Is it even possible?

One doesn't, yet -- or one gets a better PostScript viewer :-).  As
the docs say, the "multimedia" support in there now is a hack and will
be better in the future.

Subject: HTTP2 Patch for WWW Servers
To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 93 10:33:20 BST
Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.36.1.1]

Most WWW Servers need patching!
===============================

I have just finished upgrading our WWW servers and clients to
use HTTP2 and ran across a problem in using existing servers:

The new format:

    GET path HTRQ/V1.0\r\n

screws existing virtually all existing WWW servers which see the
version number as part of the path string. So you get errors like:

    a)  an empty file - the server simply gave up and closed the connection

    b)  a message to the effect: can't open file "foo.html HTRQ/V1.0"

The patch needed is very simple - you just need to check for a space
chararacter in the path string and if present, null it out!

        void http2_patch(char *path)
        {
            char *p;

            p = strchr(path, ' ');

            if (p)
                *p = '\0';
        }

Most of the CERN servers do accept the new format, with the exception
of the WAIS gateway - on info.cern.ch:8001 which needs patching.

A major motivation behind the new format is to allow servers to return
machine readable status information. This was a major omission with the
older protocol.

We have used the Authorization: field in HTRQ/V1.0 to give clients access
to private information using a username/password approach in the same
vein as rlogin, with support for /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts. We expect
to take advantage of the ChargeTo: field soon to cross-charge for selected
information.

Subject: HTML Editing

I'm about to release v0.1 of my (Xlib, Xt and Athena Widget) HTML
editor, and I want to know what keybindings you would like.

This is what I have at the moment, but they overwrite the EMACS-style
bindings.  Would you rather lose (say) word-forward or have to use
something like Shift-Meta-F to have a preformatted block?

Subject: Mosaic support/feedback issues
X-Md4-Signature: f0219b8afa9718077914470dde006504

Dear Mosaic'ers,

The email load related to Mosaic from all over the world is crushing
my poor little Indigo.  This is *wonderful*, and this level of
external feedback has greatly contributed to the current success of
the Mosaic project (both internally at NCSA and in the outside world).

We are in the process of putting together a support team to deal
efficiently and thoroughly with Mosaic questions, comments, bug
reports, and general feedback; this support structure will be moving
into place over the next few months.  We are also in the process of
generating real documentation, including printed beginner-level user
guides and the like, for general distribution and use.

So, two comments.......

(a) Please send Mosaic-related correspondence (up to and including bug
    reports) to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu whenever possible.  That way,
    all relevant support people (as well as myself) will automatically
    get copies of all incoming messages, which will help the
    preparation and execution of our support plan considerably.

(b) Please don't be discouraged if you don't get a response to a
    question, comment, or bug report immediately.  In particular,
    please don't *stop* sending feedback to us if we haven't responded
    to previous messages in a timely enough manner -- I read, and will
    continue to read, everything that comes in, but I just don't have
    enough time in the day to answer every message myself anymore
    (which is why we're putting together a real support team).  Every
    message you send us is valuable feedback that will be read and, to
    the best of our ability, acted upon.  Over time, we will try to
    catch up and reply to any messages that have slipped by me over
    the past few months and that inadvertently slip through the cracks
    as the support structure falls into place now..... in fact, I'm
    shortly going to dump the contents of my Mosaic mail folders
    (about 12 megs worth) from the last few months on our support
    people, so they'll undoubtedly have plenty to do right off the
    bat.

So, the bottom line is....... keep the feedback and questions coming!

Cheers,
Marc

Here's a useful function:

Cut out the selected text, and put it in a new file,
with a link from where it was to where it is now, and leave
me typing in the linked source anchor.

Also:  link the selected text to a new file, and leave me 
typing into that new file.

An option of whether to prompt for or make up filenames
would be useful.

Any progress on the text version? I was just trying to hack in a URL snarfer
into gnus, and I don't have a postscript printer at home. The thing I can't
remember is how URLs are supposed to be incorporated into netnews style
documents; I've been using an SGML style '&'...';' wrapper when I point
to stuff, but that's just cos I wasn't sure what the right thing to do is.

These are experimental and in the middle of being transferred into the

Heh heh heh ... Rich Wiggins asked me to give the growth statistics in
the WWW FAQ (http://www.vuw.ac.nz/non-local/gnat/www-faq.html) for
both gopher and WWW.  He gave me the raw numbers, and what I get is:

Over the three (or is it four) month period from December '92 to March
'93, gopher usage increased by 65%.  If you think that sounds
impressive, wait -- WWW usage increased by 2800%.  Of course, the
relative operational ages of the systems should be taken into account,
but it still sounds pretty darn impressive :)

Note one thing however -- I looked at my usage stats the other day and
found they had increased trmendously.  However, close inspection of
the log file showed that around April 3-6 a mail robot at
void.ncsa.uiuc.edu had been active, multiplying my load from an
average twenty to over a thousand requests per day...

Just to show that you need to know what you're measuring...

Interesting hostname, by the way...

Note also that gopher statistics are inflated - there's double counting
(and double sending) of bytes when a gopher server fetches a file by
FTP and then gophers it to the client.

This is a clear case where high byte counts should be seen as a sign
of design defects not wide use...

Not quite Ed, its counted once, when it shouldnt be counted at all! The
gopher-ftp gateway -> ftp server hop doesnt get counted.

Agreed! I posted a patch that fixes this defect for the Unix gopher
client.

Well, that's certainly not OUR fault!

(...................... well, OK, maybe it is.)

Eric Bina (ebina@ncsa.uiuc.edu) has been working on some automated
net-scanning tools -- yell at him if he's causing trouble.....

  I would like to know not just whether a document has changed, but also what
about it is new/different.  This could be done by managing documents via
SCCS or some similar system which tracks modifications over time.  The client
could then request any particular version(s) of a document which are available
and display the results in some appropriate fashion (highlighting, different
fonts, etc).  A client may choose to keep a version history of previously
visited documents.
  This sort of functionality would require support in both HTML and HTTP, I
believe.  There needs to be some notion of the "current" or default version
of a multi-version document in the URL syntax.  The protocol should
provide some mechanism for the server to inform the client which versions
are available.  
  And then, of course, there's the issue of how to inform a "subscriber" that
an updated version is available.

Mitra,

Porting the library should be a piece of cake.  It has been for all  
other unix systems, and it runs on VMS...  Have you trid just
compiling as for some other machine?  We don't have SCO unix here.

Greetings.  I attempted to compile the WWW Library v203b for CMS, but I
got a lot of 'long name' problems. Some new variables need to be added
to the "SHORT_NAMES" re-definitions.

(1) Are these IBM changes going to be made to the library code (and the
    linemode browser code)?   WHEN ??

(2) Is anyone aware of a full screen (or at least 3270) browser for CMS?

Thanx.

OK, hypothetical question time.

Suppose we had developed a new net scanning tool that consisted of a
daemon that can run independently of user guidance and a Motif-based
GUI that can attach/detach to/from the daemon at any time and allow a
user to interactively or asynchronously guide the daemon's progress
through the information space on the global network.

Suppose further, and more specifically, that this front-end was really
really impressive (also suppose I didn't write it, so I could
theoretically say that without sounding pompous) and included
interactive drag/drop/point/click graphical maps of the information
space the daemon traversed, as well as direct control over a variety
of constraint parameters to control the daemon's progress both in real
time and asynchronously (e.g., you can tell it where to look and what
to look for interactively, and then detach and let it run
asynchronously overnight, and then reattach in the morning to discover
what it's found).

If we had theoretically developed such a hypothetical tool, should we
release it to the net?  Or are experiences similar to Guido's above,
except on a much larger scale, liable to have severely deleterious
effects on the network and the servers currently on it, and should we
therefore not release it?

You be the judge.........

Marc

    Woooaaah ... this could be a problem. :)  The stats on our server went
from about 500 a day or so, to over 6000 in a 5 hour stretch when your bot
was roaming (didn't help that it seemed to jump into the man page link).
This could get ridiculous if people at 20 sites decided to let this bot
loose at once.
 
    How about:

	1. Have 2 or 3 sites that will have the bot - presumably major WWW
           sites (cern, ncsa, ??).  They can run their bots once a month,
           or whenever a new site opened, they could aim it there and let
           it rip.
        2. Extend the Motif interface so that it can connect to a remote
           machine (if it can't already).  Also tone it down a bit, so
           people not on the machine where its running can't point it in
           new areas or control its movement.  Have the main sites put up
           the data they collect on some sort of toned-down server, and let
           people look at the graphical representation of 'WEB-Space'(tm)
        3. Release the toned-down motif interface to everyone

   Would this be possible the way this hypothetical server/interface are
right now?  Or is this a dumb idea?  

   Also - how would(does) this display the 'map' of the information it
finds?  Just curious.

Hey folks, this is the same exact problem that 'archie' and 'veronica'
have run up against, let's see if we can draw conclusions from those.

First, it is better if you have a tool to generate a map to run it n
times locally on n hosts and then send those results out to be merged
together.  The archie equivalent of this is the "ls-lR.Z" file you see
in FTP sites.

Second if you do this well it will be popular and perhaps so popular
that your server will explode from overuse.

It would be better to move slowly and go for enough funding for
infrastructure so that it's not just a gee-can-we-do-it hack that ends
up being instantly oversubscribed....

Yes, this is far better if updated regularly.

Perhaps some code could be added to the http daemon to return an error
message when the system load or number of sessions exceeds a certain,
configurable limit ? Sendmail has a similar facility.

X-Md4-Signature: c4b2af072a3400678ee91652a8970882

Version 1.0 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, is hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/xmosaic-source/xmosaic-1.0.tar.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sun.Z

                            .../xmosaic-diffs/xmosaic-0.13-1.0-diffs.Z

Changes since beta version 0.13 include:

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
 o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. 
 o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy
   dana@thumper.bellcore.com). 
 o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). 
 o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). 
 o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
   bingle@cs.purdue.edu). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

Comments, questions, and bug reports should be directed to

provide.

HMML is in fact already an extension of HTML for multimedia from  
O'Reilly.  There are similar extenstions from NCSA.  We just have to  
standardize on them for the next DTD which we define.  HTML was  
checkpointed so as not to make a moving target.  NCSA's (released)  
Mosaic for X handles embedded images in the hypertext, as does  
O'Reilly's (unreleased) Viola.

The pictures don't seem to have been very complicated to add (just to  
implement), it is just a question of agreeing on syntax.

In the WWW context, of couse, the tags refer to embedded images by
W3 address, and the retrieval code is responsible for negotiating a
suitable transfer representation for the pic independently of the
embedding document.

On Marc's suggestion I grabbed the xmosaic-1.0 files, the library code
in there is much changed from the WWW library, although its parentage is
still visible.

The first set of changes worked fine and got rid of a bunch of bugs,
however the sticky point is in HTFile.c where it uses the "direct"
structure rather than "dirent" which is (according to xmosaic's tcp.h
file) more appropriate for several systems.  Unfortunately the code is
differennt enough between xmosaic and WWW that without better
understanding its not possible to just copy it over.

The actual error reported is that there is no d_namlen in the
structure.

Any help appreciated,

  Of course we want intelligent agents to search the information space for
us!  How else are we going to be able to talk to this web-monster we're
creating?  We need these "bots".
  The debate thus far has focused entirely on how to avoid taxing the
limited resources (network bandwidth, cpu cycles, etc) currently available.  
This is certainly an important consideration since we are here and now.
But, it seems to me that we should be spending more time talking about how
to enhance the intelligence of the agent, so that it's searches are more
efficient.  
  Further, it seems that the biggest obstacle, at this point, in moving
towards more intelligent searches is a lack of support in the web infra-
structure.  While SGML gives you a lot of structure within a node. the
links which relate one node to another provide no information about the
nature of the relationship between the nodes.  I know there has been dis-
cussion among WWW people in the past about using typed links, but I don't
know why they haven't been implemented.  Is it just something which noone
has gotten around to yet, or is there some reason why typed links have
been avoided? (other than backwards compatibility reasons, I mean)

Why don't we do this: add a new command to a server (like GET) that is
LIST.  This returns a list of titles and URLs.  Existing servers,
gateways, etc, won't support this and so won't be listed.  As the new
releases of the servers (incorporating this command) come online, they
will be listed and registered.

Nifty?

    The beta version .3 of NCSA's HTTP server has been released and is
on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu (141.142.20.50) under /Web/ncsa_httpd.

    NCSA's httpd is a public domain implementation of the HTTP1
protocol, with some gopher-related extensions. I have attached the
README.BETA.3 and README.GOPHER files below.

    There are precompiled binaries for DEC's DECstation and DEC AXP
workstations, sun4 (SPARC) workstations, SGI Iris workstations,
NeXT's, and IBM RS/6000 workstations available on the ftp server. If
you port the server to another platform and need to modify anything to
do so, please let me know what the modifications were.

Any suggestions or bug/problem reports please send to

NCSA HTTP server.

Beta release .3

This code is in the public domain. Specifically, we give to the public
domain all rights for future licensing of the source code, all resale
rights, and all publishing rights.

We ask, but do not require, that the following message be included in
all derived works:

Portions developed at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS GIVES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
FOR THE SOFTWARE AND/OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


Now that that's out of the way, we can move on to more interesting
things.

OVERVIEW
--------

    You've found the Beta release of NCSA's HTTP server. This code is
in testing and development, but is currently fully functional as an
HTTP1 server. 

This is beta release .3

NEW IN RELEASE .3
-----------------

    o Security hole (should be the last) fixed
    o Nearly complete drop-in gopher support. See README.GOPHER for details
    o Not being able to find the config file does not send back a path

NEW IN RELEASE .2
-----------------

    o Two security holes fixed
    o Double slashes in root index fixed
    o Not being able to find the error files no longer hangs the server

FEATURES
--------

    o Directory aliasing and denial. The server can be configured to
map different directories to different places in the filesystem, and
easily deny access to a particular directory or file by mapping it to
something which does not exist. The interface is designed to be simple.

    o Automatic directory index files and on-the-fly index generation.
If the server finds that the client is requesting a directory, it
first checks for a file, by default called "index.html" but which can
be compiled to any name, and if it does not find such a file it
generates an HTML index of the directory and sends it back to the
client.

    o Drop-in gopher support. This server is able to automatically
interpret gopher directory structures and construct, on the fly, HTML
indexes of them. Should be faster than gopherd in HTML mode.

    o Designed to be small and low-impact: the entire source is
currently ~500 lines, without gopher support. It's 800 with gopher support.

FUTURE PLANS
------------

    o HTTP2 support.

    o The ability to run from something other than inetd, so people
who are not root can use it.

    o Transfer logging

    o On the fly uncompression.


That should be all you need. E-mail problems, suggestions for features
or documentation, cash donations, food, etc. to robm@ncsa.uiuc.edu. I 
encourage you to try and break the server, or compromise its security, and 
let me know how you did it so I can fix it.

NCSA HTTP server.

Beta release .3

This code is in the public domain. Specifically, we give to the public
domain all rights for future licensing of the source code, all resale
rights, and all publishing rights.

We ask, but do not require, that the following message be included in
all derived works:

Portions developed at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS GIVES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
FOR THE SOFTWARE AND/OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


Now that that's out of the way, we can move on to more interesting
things.


OVERVIEW OF GOPHER SUPPORT
--------------------------

    As of beta release .3, this server will automatically generate
HTML listings of a gopher directory without going through gopherd.
This means that . files which are links are processed, and .cap files
are processed. Any request which begins with /gopher-data will be
considered a gopher request if gopher is turned on. Therefore, mapping
/gopher-data to the location of your server's data will allow you to
access /gopher-data and get a gopher listing in return.

    These features are new to .3, and I would appreciate any and all
feedback on its usefulness, features and/or lack thereof, problems,
and suggestions.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

    o Shell scripts are not executed; i.e. a file of type 0 with #! at
the beginning is returned plaintext instead of being executed.

    o There is a slight ordering inconsistency between this server and
the real gopherd, i.e. all numbered are placed first, in order, THEN
the unnumbered files are placed in alphabetical order. The gopher
server fills in the holes with alphabetized entries.

    o Not all gopher features are currently supported, namely the ph
interface.

    o Files of type 's', 'G', 'I', and any files which are special and
need to be treated in a special way are sent back to the client.
Therefore, if the file does not have the proper extension the client
may not recognize it. i.e. if a GIF does not have the .gif extension
NCSA Mosaic probably won't recognize it.


INSTALLATION
------------

    See the file INSTALL for normal and gopher installations. Be sure
you define GROK_GOPHER in httpd.h if you are compiling the server, or
that you use the binary with gopher support if you are using a
precompiled one.

Currently, how do HTML and MIME relate?
I gather that HTML is intended to eventually be a MIME subtype -- is this
supported at all anywhere?  It might be nice to send HTML mail to people.

HTML as a MIME subtype had been waiting on a stable HTML spec to
present to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the people who
keep track of such names).

I am lead to belive that the 'html.dtd' document type definition for
files according to the SGML standard has been successfully processed
by a commercial SGML package (SoftQuad Author/Editor).  I'd encourage
people to try out other SGML systems (if necessary by posting stuff
to comp.text.sgml) and verify that we have the bugs shaken out, then
approach IANA with the spec.

  Well, what d'ya know?  Thanks, Tim! I guess I'd better get around to
reading that spec.
  At first glance, it looks like there are two ways of relating one
document/node to another.  First, there is the LINK property in the header
of the node.  There may be any number of LINK elements within the header,
each one specifies some relationship between the document and some other
specifed document.  Secondly, a relationship can be specified for any
anchor using the REL or REV attributes.  There are currently about 13
relationship types currently supported.  See sections 3.1, 3.6, 3.15, and
chapter 6 of ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc/html-spec.ps.
  So, why are people *not* using typed links?  Has noone seen the need
or is everyone else as ignorant as I am?  Is anyone out there creating
such links?  Has anyone built support into their client(s)?
  Why are typed links interesting?  Well, one way they could be
immediately useful to me is in printing material from the web.  For
instance, I have been reading about the web, HTML, SGML, HTTP, hypertext,
etc.  The other night I wanted to take a hardcopy of some of the
documentation home with me, but I had to print it node by node.  (I did
find the postscript documents available via ftp, but they just aren't
as current or complete as the material on the web.)  If the links were
typed, and my client was smart enough, I could ask for a printout of
the current node and any anchors within it which are no more than 2 hops
away and whose type is "embed", "present", or "includes".  Depending on
the particular node that I was at, this should get me a manageable amount
of information relevant to my current interest.
  Of course, there are some design issues involved in deciding how to
display/present the results of such directives.

HTML and MIME relate as follows.  HTML is to be proposed as aMIME
text/html type.  This is not only a Good Thing as you note, it also
is essential as the full HTTP protocol send back a MIME message.
That is, it uses RFC822 fields for its headings including the
Content-type field.

Yes, it would be very nice to send HTML mail to people!

Subject: how should remote path names be handled?
X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.2

I was under the impression that when a relative or full path name
at a remote site was found, it was supposed to be converted (by the
browser) into a full http path, based on the current site and document.

Someone mentioned though that this is not the behaviour of some browsers.
So what should we expect?  Also, is there a difference in interpreting
a URL at a remote site between file:/blah    and  /blah ?

Examples:

current document
      http://mars.cs.state.edu:80/docs/cartoons/flinstones.html

link found
      HREF=jetsons.html
  is translated as
      http://mars.cs.state.edu:80/docs/cartoons/jetsons.html

link found
      HREF=../sitcoms/threes_company.html

link found
      HREF=/docs/drama/lalaw.html
  is translated as

Yes, no, maybe?

I think that relative paths should be translated by the browser, and
their use should be encouraged.  Full paths should not be handled, and
their use should be discouraged.  The reason is the difference in
interpretation between the local and the remote access.  Since the
http daemon translates full paths, a full remote path may not point to
a real filename, and likewise a full local path may not be a valid
filename thru the server.  On the other hand, relative paths can be
handled correctly both locally and remotely, as long as the relative
path doesn't go outside the domain of what the server will allow.

Subject: WWW library now accesses WAIS servers directly
Cc: timbl


At last I have actually got around to doing it.
The 2.04 version of the library, if compiled
appropraitely, and linked with freeWAIS libraries
client.a and wais.a, will directly grok wais:* urls
and search and retrieve from WAIS servers.

As a quite separate thing, whether or not you have the
wais protocol linked in, there is a parser for wais
source files which, apart from formatting them a little,
puts a link to the wais index itself.  So any 2.04+
client coming across a application/x-wais-source type
file (as it assumes .src files to be) will do the
necessary.

I am not 100% happy about the way it works.

Firstly, to be 100% portable it does not cache source
files, so when you follow a link to a wais database
there is nothing much to display to the user: just the
database name.  This is the old problem that a wais database
does not describe itself, you have to happen to have the
source file somewhere.  I am told that in Z30.50-9X
the EXPLAIN function will cover this. If in the mean time
I do cache source files, I wonder where would be a good 
place to put them.

Secondly, the WAIS urls are still really messy, with stuff
in there which dosn't seem apropriate. One of the things
is the format of the data, because in wais this is returned
at search time and so (as in Gopher0 and half in Gopher+)
must be stored in the link.

BTW, does anyone have a definitive list of all WAIS type
fields and all Gopher type characters?

Anyway, the code is there for anyone who wants to play.
It may be buggy yet.  You can all go write wais: URLs.
Those who don't have the wais code compiled in remember
to 

     setenv WWW_wais_GATE http://info.cern.ch:8001/

which should wouk on all the old clients.
(That gateway won't grok new clients bt I'll fix that)

Enjoy...

Tom,

Your examples were all correct.  Any missing infromation
is taken from the left hand end of the URL of the referring
document.  When a relative path is given (no protocol,
hostname or leading /) then the rule is to strip
everything off the current URL which is to the right of
its rightmost "/", the append the relative path.
This is always what you expect, except that it might
surprise you if you don't think too hard that in directory
/a/fred, "bert" refers to /a/bert, not /a/fred/bert, so
/a/fred/bert should be referred to as "fred/bert" or "./bert".
Anyway, you are right, and if there are browsers which do otherwise
that is their problem, unless I've goofed.

Tim

The last example is really worrysome!  If you are trying to follow
UNIX conventions, "./bert" should refer to the same thing as "bert",
so it would refer to "/a/bert"!  What does the library code actually
do?  (I don't have it handy!)

Another question about this subject is resolution of "../" prefixes.
In the above example, what does "../foo" refer to?  I'd hope "/foo".

Also, who is supposed to do the ".." resolution -- the client or the
server?

And what about "/../" in the middle of a path?  Does
"/foo/bar/../bletch" always mean "/foo/bletch" (if "/foo/bar" were a
symbolic link to a directory, it won't on UNIX, meaning that a client
doing "../" stripping might wind up at a different place than a server
blindly following the path (which might be dangerous if there are more
"../" parts than allowed -- I don't know if servers allow this).

Finally, I believe there are (or were) some gateway servers on the net
that are confused about this themselves: when in /a/b and attempting
to generate a relative reference to c, they would end up referring to
/a/b/c instead of /a/c, or when attempting to refer one level up they
would point to /a/a instead of /a.  (I seem to remember the CERN Emacs
Info gateway did this -- can't find where it is right now...)

>/a/fred, "bert" refers to /a/bert, not /a/fred/bert, so

I think you need to clarify this.  If you are in a document inside of
/a/fred/  then bert should refer to /a/fred/bert.  If you meant that
fred is a document (the current one) inside of a, then bert should
refer to /a/bert.

>/a/fred/bert should be referred to as "fred/bert" or "./bert".
>Anyway, you are right, and if there are browsers which do otherwise

Should the browser collapse a .. path by itself, or pass it on to the
server:

  in           http://server/foo/bar/baz/doc.html
  translate    ../../cool.html
  to           http://server/foo/bar/baz/../../cool.html
  or           http://server/foo/doc.html

And I should note that collapsing the path is a very trivial operation.

Subject: Re:  how should remote path names be handled?

Here's an idea can help with the remote pathname issues.
Excuse me if it's already in HTML 2.0 (actually the URL
spec) but I don't think it is.

How about variable name substitution in URLs?  E.g., you
could use a HREF=file://$parentsite$parentdir/foo.html to make
explicit how the broswer should construct relative pathnames.

The advantage of this over the current HREF=file:foo.html
scheme is it opens up many other kinds of context-sensitive
URLs, like substituting the parentsite but naming a new
directory path.  Or, browsers (the WWW library I guess) could
define new variables like $standardsite, which would depend
on the user's continent (per the recent suggestion about
distributing servers).

Or, what intriques me the most is using variable substitution
with Dave Raggett's electronic forms.  That is, we could define
a tag construct like

  <blank FIELDTYPE=string LVAL=keyw1>Enter Keyword:</entry>

A typical GUI browser would render this as an entry widget embedded
at the appropriate spot in the text.  Anything typed into the
widget would become the value of the variable $keyw1, and
subsequently substituted into a URL.  For example, we could put
WAIS keyword prompts inside the server HTML document, which would
be a good thing.

I'm not following this discussion in detail, but one issue I dont see addressed
is that the root of the tree will mean different things depending on the
application - for example ftp:/pub/fred is not the same as the file /pub/fred
or gopher:/pub/fred since both ftp and gopher interpret paths relative to 
a base address passed to the server.

==================
There is a very interesting new WAIS server. It is called DYNAMIC netfind
and performs Netfind searches via WAIS. For details see appendix of this
mail.

I tried to access this new database via the WWW-WAIS Gateway. Unfortunately
my XMosaic 1.0 client and the www 1.4a client running on info.cern.ch
both are reporting the following error:

----- Begin Included Message -----

WAISGate: Syntax error in WWW document address
`/ftp.cs.colorado.edu:8000/DYNAMIC%20netfind/DYNAMIC' 

Access error

The WWW-WAIS gateway reports the following error:

Syntax error in WWW document address 

Address received was 

/ftp.cs.colorado.edu:8000/DYNAMIC%20netfind/DYNAMIC

Syntax is //node:port/databse 

or //node:port/databse?query+query 

or //node:port/database/doctype/doclength/docid 


----- End Included Message -----

Dynamic searches via WAIS would be a very valuable new service which
would perfectly integrate in WWW.

Is there an easy way to patch the WAIS Gateway so that it can deal with
those kind of searches?

DYNAMIC netfind

This WAIS server performs Netfind searches.  It uses the waisserver
from the Dynamic WAIS prototype at the University of Colorado in
Boulder.  To use this WAIS server: supply keywords for a Netfind
search.  A list of matching domains will be returned as relevant
documents.  Choose one of the domains to retrieve the results from a
Netfind search for that domain.  Due to the strict query format for
Netfind, keywords must be in the format: name key key...  

For example, to find information about Darren Hardy at the University
of Colorado in Boulder, use the keywords 'hardy boulder colorado' or
'hardy boulder colorado computer science'.

In order to use X WAIS with the Dynamic WAIS server you can apply the
patch for xwais found in the Dynamic WAIS distribution.  It's a simple
one-line patch to xwais.  Or you can add a text viewer to your filters
preference (either in the Xwais.filters resource or with the \

==================

In my previous mail I included the description from dynamic-netfind.src.
I took the description which was diplayed by xmosaic and generated from the
WWW-WAIS Gateway. Unfortunately the gateway just returned the first
n lines of the description.

Is this a bug or a feature ?

See the appendix of this mail for the full description.

P.S.: There is also a DYNAMIC archie

Dynamic WAIS extends the WAIS paradigm to support information from
remote search systems (as opposed to the usual collection of static
documents).  It supports gateways from WAIS to Archie and to our
Netfind Internet User directory service.  Unlike menu-level gateways
(such as the current interim telnet interface from the Internet Gopher
system to Netfind), Dynamic WAIS uses the Z39.50 information retrieval
protocol to seamlessly integrate the information spaces.  This approach
allows users to access a great deal of diverse information without
learning multiple user interfaces.

The key idea behind the Dynamic WAIS gateways is the conceptual work of
constructing mappings between the WAIS search-and-retrieve operations,
and the underlying Archie and Netfind operations.  In the case of
Netfind, for example, when the Dynamic WAIS user requests a search using
the \"dynamic-netfind.src\" WAIS source, the search is translated to a
lookup in the Netfind seed database, to determine potential domains to
search.  The Netfind domain selection request is then mapped into a WAIS
database selection request.  Once the user selects one of the domains to
search, the WAIS retrieval phase is mapped into an actual domain search
in Netfind.

If you would like to learn more about Dynamic WAIS, you can obtain the
source to the Dynamic WAIS prototype The prototype is available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.colorado.edu in /pub/cs/distribs/dynamicwais.  
A paper on Dynamic WAIS is in preparation.

==================
I had severe problems with relative pathnames when I setup
a WAIS database of my local set of HTML pages.

The idea behind setting up this database was, that I would
be able to generate a projection of the Web based on a search.

After I retrieve a HTML Page from the WAIS database I want to
be able to follow all the links in the HTML Page.

But I experienced that I could only follow links with absolute
pathnames. A relative URL like "HREF=QuickGuide.html" was 
translated to the following:

http://info:8001/info:21401/AB-WWW/HTML/2798/1=ikarus%3A21401;2=/hom
e/bloemer/docs/wais/wais-databases/AB-WWW;3=0%202798%20/home/bloemer/appl/inter

ppl/internet/infosystems/www/tmp/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/QuickGuide.html

This yields an error of 'Missing DocID in request'.

So if you want to setup a WAIS database for searching through your
information system the only way seems to be using absolute pathnames.

Or is the last statement wrong ?

  If you are going to add variable substitution to URL's, then perhaps
it would be best to define two types of variables: those which are
to be interpreted by the client, and those which the server should
expand.  
  Thus, a user could configure their browser session so as to
force a particular interpretation of any "variant" links
encountered.  The $standardsite variable mentioned above is
one example of a variable which should be interpreted locally,
i.e. by the client.
  Server-interpreted variables, on the other hand, could be used
by information administrators to ease the task of maintaining
document archives and to enhance reliability and efficiency.  The
$parentsite and $parentdir variables mentioned in Jay's message
are examples of these types of variables.  Another example would
be a $least_busy_server_of_group_GROUP variable, as in
	http://$least_busy_of_group_GROUP/foo.html.
The server would replace this variable with the address of the least
busy server in the group of servers named GROUP.
  So, how are the two types distinguished?  Suppose that a server
variable is preceeded by a single '$'. and client variables would be
referenced by two $, o

Ironically, a similar but different proposal called "simplemail" is
currently being discussed in the IETF mailing list devoted to MIME
(ietf-822).  This is also based on common informal conventions used in
news today, like _this_ or *this*.  Even more ironically, simplemail
was also started by some individuals who didn't like richtext, the
proposal for "simple" text formatting that was originally part of the
proposed MIME standard (it is now a separate RFC).  Richtext looks
like SGML (at least superficially -- some real SGML gurus are offended
by richtext's claim of SGML-ness).

I'm not sure what the importance for WWW is, however.  There's a niche
for simplemail and/or setext in the mail/news world, because many
people will see it without any kind of viewer, and many others will be
composing it casually without help.  WWW documents are *always* viewed
by end users through an HTML-aware viewer, and HTML-aware editors
exist.  Translators from setext or simplemail to richer formats will
appear when these formats really take off.

At least one of simplemail's authors is on the WWW list. (Bill --
where are the simplemail files now?)

Subject: Re: how should remote path names be handled?


This is one of the ways inwhich I an unhappy ith the WAIS-WWW interface.
The WAIS docid is by design a string which should be opaque -- that
it does not hve any client-visible features like / ina URL to allow
relative pathnames. In fact, of course, all it really needs is the
file name, and the document type.  These could be put in in plain.
In fact we have to treat it as an opaque string, almost.We do 
make the assumption that it is a set of numbered fields. This is already
breaking the spec.  We can't assume what those fields are as from time
to time you find an experimental WAIS server weird numbers (which used
to crash the old gateway).

The solution as I see it is to dismantle the freeWAIS code a little
more and make a W3 server which will sit on top of the index
and return real pathnames.

(or you could cheat and run a W3 server which served up the files,
and also was the wais gateway, and change HTWAIS.c so that instead
of returning WAIS URLs it returned URLs pointing to itself as an HTTP
server. The code would not be able to access other WAIS servers but
itwould avoid changing any WAIS code.  Themapping from WAIS URL
to HTTP URL would have to take into account the rule file, or the
rul file would have to avoid mapping between docids and filenames  :-(

If we make a tiny hack to the WWW "news reader", e.g the thing that
parses NNTP articles, so that text of the form
    file://ftp.msen.com:/pub/emv/
or
    gopher://gopher.msen.com:70/
or other URLs standing by themselves on a line get treated as if they 
were something like
    <a href=file://ftp.msen.com:/pub/emv/></a>
then et voila we get very inexpensive hypertext links from inside news.

To simplify the parsing assume only that the URL is surrounded by whitespace.
Nothing else on the line.

I think this would work OK with both 'setext' and 'simplemail', so
long as both proposals are sparing with markup.

I actually think that simplemail is quite a bit simpler and less
feature-full than setext, so perhaps this claim is a bit overstated.  My
argument was that for anything more complicated, a *real* markup
language, HTML or something richer, should be used.

Hi, I've been working on a HTTP server written in perl (originally from
Marc VanHeyningen at cs.indiana.edu).  I've gotten to the point where I'm
happy with it for my needs and thought maybe someone else might find it
useful.

I'm currently calling it version 0.14.  You can always get the latest
from <A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/server">here</A>.

You can try it out using the <A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/">server</A>
I have setup for my company if you like.

Features:

 o Very easy to setup (all code is written in perl)
 o README file with helpful tips
 o config file for easy setup
 o HTML docs <A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/server/httpd.html">here</A>
 o can be run by normal user if not using port 80
 o chroot() support for more security if wanted
 o directory browser (with last modification, size and file/directory info)
 o date server sample code
 o finger server sample code
 o Other sample gateways from the original code (siks, neuro, sunman)
 o "loadable" drivers (helpful in debugging new gateways)

The code is provided ``as is'', and without warranty but feel free to
send me <sanders@bsdi.com> comments and I'll try and make it better.
If you write other gateways using this scheme please send them to me
and I'll try and integrate them.

a new DTD for extensions to the current HTML spec. Don't get worried - the
existing HTML tags will continue unchanged.

We need to pin down the HTML standard to place it on a proper footing as a
MIME content type. Many browsers now go beyond the current DTD and it is only
right that we update the DTD to reflect the best ideas. I hope to have a
preliminary draft available within a week or two to fire off discussions.
The aim is to evolve a consensus view of what extensions are appropriate
and which preserve the overall simplicity of HTML.

The features to consider include:

    o   nested lists (e.g. OL within UL, UL within DL, ...)
    o   embedded images with text flow etc.
    o   query forms
    o   tables
    o   other features ...

The DTD will be tested to ensure it conforms to the SGML standard. I also
would like to have software that allows you to check if your html documents
conform to the extended DTD (with nice warning messages). It would also be
very useful to collect guidelines for how clients should deal with bad HTML -
what rules of thumb people have found to be useful in practice ...

Regards,

Dave Raggett

Excellent! One area I would like to see clearly documented is what types of 
nesting of tags is legal, I have not found it clearly documented in the 
existing HTML documentation (of course maybe I didn't follow the right link).

For example, which of the following are legal/supported/encouraged HTML??

<a href=x>The <h1>Link</h1></a>
<a href=x>The <b>link</b></a>    
<b><i><e>Weird</e></i></b>     etc. etc. etc....

Of course one answer is that browsers should do their best with whatever they 
get....but I think in the interest of portability (and of something that works 
fine with ine browser working equally well with another one) it would be better 
to document what things are required to be supported. It would also be useful 
for browsers to have a -noextentensions flag (or some moral equivalent) under 
which they flag anything other than the strictly supported constructs to aid 
people in writing portable HTML.

Dave,

Three cheers to you for starting to pull together HTML enhancements!

On the subject of query forms, maybe I just don't understand where
Tim's old <QUERYFORM> ideas were heading, but we're working on an
approach that I like better.  I hinted at it in a recent message
regarding variable substitution, here's more detail.

Define new tags for acquiring information from the user about an
object retrieval.  A basic set of these tags is:

1.<ENTRYBLANK TYPE=type LENGTH=length DEFAULT=default VAR=lval>
  Prompt </ENTRYBLANK>

2.<QUESTION TYPE=type DEFAULT=default VAR=lval> Prompt </QUESTION>

3.<CHOICE DEFAULT=default VAR=lval>
  <ALTERNATIVE VAL=value1> Prompt1
  ...
  <ALTERNATIVE VAL=valuen> Promptn
  </CHOICE>

A GUI browser, for example, would turn the first kind of tags into
embedded entry widgets and do value checking based on the *type*
(e.g., string, bool, int, float).  Tags of the second kind might
turn into checkboxes, where the type could be 2-state or 3-state.
In both cases the Prompt would be a label string.  The GUI browser
could turn CHOICE constructs into radio buttons or listboxes,
depending on the number of ALTERNATIVES, the homgeneity of the 
Prompt lengths, etc.

A tty/emacs browser could turn these tags into screen prompts,
y/n questions, menu lists, whatever.

Either way, the key is that these tags set variables, named by VAR
parameters, first to the default value and then to any input by the
user.  These variables can then be substituted into URLs, thereby
dynamically creating URLs based on how the user fills in a form.

This scheme does require a URL variable substitution scheme like
I described in a recent message.  We're working on an implementation
as mods to the HTML 2.0 library.  Tim, would you be interested in
these mods?

It would be particularly nice if we got this right.  There was an
exchange a couple of months ago (beginning of March) that you (Dave)
were a part of, about allowing arbitrary embedded ``things'', with their
data being either specified in-line, or being included from another
document.  These things could be images or animations or audio or text
or whatever.  Marc mentioned several problems to be solved (I remember
circular references, for example).

Separable from this is another good idea:

Sounds like a good thing.  I've always been sort of surprised that TIFF
or another of these extensible image formats hasn't already been
extended to be a ``hyperimage'' format.

  Um, I've been playing with various ways of getting postscript to display
via XMosaic (1.0). When you use FTP, things are fine, because the FTP daemon
doesn't do any processing, and so when XMosaic hands off to Ghostview or
whatever, life is fine.

  However, when HTTP processes the file, it puts the line :

<PLAINTEXT>

in front of the rest of the document. Thus, when it gets back to Ghostview,
it chokes because <PLAINTEXT> is invalid PS. This may again get us to the
point of needing "type tags" for different types of files, but with the
coming various "multi-media" browsers, it seems to me to be a problem we
need to solve somehow (perhaps the URLs will help, but I don't think they
are the ultimate solution).

  I can just set up a filter for Ghostscript which removes the offending
line, but is there a better solution?

				Thanks, <Mowgli>

The long-term solution is to move to HTTP2.  One short-term solution
that you may want to explore is the NCSA public domain httpd, on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/ncsa_httpd, which will never do this to
data files.

Cheers,
Marc

Query forms and tables are my top two requests.  Dave's previous
proposals for query forms looked great to me at the time (as did his
table ideas -- at least I think they were his.....?  maybe I'm
confused).

Dave,
	O'Reilly and Associates is *extremely* interested in helping you with
this effort.  We have a number of products in development which use HTML as
their technology base.  We see the future development of HTML to be of great
importance to our efforts.

	You mention the following as important issues in the future of HTML:

<QUOTE AUTHOR="Dave_Raggett <dsr@hplp.hpl.hp.com>">
    o   nested lists (e.g. OL within UL, UL within DL, ...)
    o   embedded images with text flow etc.
    o   query forms
    o   tables
</QUOTE>

	I would suggest that lists and text flow are really exclusively
rendering issues.  When I want to make a nested list, I may wish to write it
thusly:

<EXAMPLE>
	<UL>
	<LI>First Term, First Level.
	<UL>
	<LI>First Term, Second Level.
	<LI>Second Term, Second Level.
	</UL>
	<LI>Second Term, First Level.
	</UL>
</EXAMPLE>

	And I might *EXPECT* that it would be rendered as:

<PRE>
		First Term, First Level
			First Term, Second Level
			Second Term, Second Level
		Second Term, First Level
</PRE>

	
<COMMENT> And in fact, under Xmosaic, the *right* thing is done, with the
addition of some nice bullets to differentiate the different levels of the list.
</COMMENT>

But since there is no rendering information in HTML, and by definition there
cannot be, how the terms appear on the screen is left up to the renderer.  For
example, the www text mode browser renders these lists thusly: 

<PRE>
		First Term, First Level.
      
		First Term, Second Level.
      
		Second Term, Second Level.
      
		Second Term, First Level.
     
		[End]
</PRE>

	Since there is no definition of how things *must* look when presented to
the user, both behaviors are absolutely correct.

<HYPOTHESIS> Any expectations of how an object is rendered will be incorrect in
some instance of the use of that object.  Thus, all expectations of an object's
appearance are generally inadvisable.  </HYPOTHESIS>

	I would also suggest that the requirements of 'text flow' around
embedded graphics are also rendering time issues and should not effect the
definition of HTML. 

<OPINION> I believe that HTML, like it's progenitor SGML, should be simply a
method of describing data, not how it should appear on the screen.  In fact, I
think that this is exactly the sentiment which Tim Berners-Lee has expressed to
us all regarding his vision of HTML. The formatting of lists and the flow of
text around graphics do not fit this definition.  If this is an incorrect
assessment of the role HTML needs to serve I would be very interested in hearing
from others. </OPINION>

	The next elements on your list, query forms and tables, seem to be a
little clearer but pose similar problems. 

	To describe a "form", in the traditional sense, implies it's layout
simply based on the fact that a "form" is the presentation of information in a
controlled layout or format.  

<HYPOTHESIS> A form or table cannot be specified in HTML without breaking one of
HTML's first principles since forms and tables are descriptions of the
appearance of information in relationship to other elements and not the
description of information in terms of type and content. </HYPOTHESIS>

I believe that we can ask questions:

<EXAMPLE>
	<QUERY DEFAULT="Red" OPTIONS="Black|Blue|Red|Green|White">
	What is your favorite colour?
	</QUERY> 
</EXAMPLE>

since this is the tagging of an entity (description of data), with certain
special behaviors or attributes defined, I would think that this would be a
natural for HTML.

But, the moment we start talking about collecting this information into forms or
tables, with set, defined  relationships between elements, we are treading on
very thin ice, indeed. 

<ASIDE> I hesitate to mention it, but SGML has few (if any) provisions for
handling tabular data, and there are a lot of people who really want to be able
to do this, desperately! </ASIDE>

<ASSERTION> The organization of information into tabular form is intrinsically a
render-time issue, not a representational one. </ASSERTION>


	I am very interested in these issues, both from a personal standpoint
and a company one.  I have some ideas regarding a possible solution which I will
send out under seperate cover.  Thanks for your time.

Yup, and I got jumped on (justifiably so, I suppose :-).  What
concerns me is not necessarily circular references (as Guido pointed
out at the time, that's easily avoidable) but rather the precedent and
mechanism this puts in place for making documents arbitrarily complex
in terms of the network connections needed to put them together on the
client side.  Inlined images located on other servers are bad enough
-- if we start making generic inclusions available, things are going
to get hairy.  IMHO.

Plus, this is hypertext -- most times, generic inclusions shouldn't be
per se necessary, or even necessarily useful compared to a hyperlink.

Also, I'm not certain that any multimedia data other than images needs
to be specifiable as inlined/included.  Things like audio and MPEG can
simply be pointed at from an anchor (as Mosaic does) and forked to
external viewers or processed internally, whichever the browser
prefers -- and with inlined images the whole thing will be iconic
anyway.

I would certainly love to hear discussion about what to do with text
flow -- it's starting to become a popular request.

Cheers,
Marc

Well, not quite.  Though I've come to really enjoy XMosaic, and
appreciate greatly the enormous utility it provides, there do seem to be
two classes of documents:  those which are displayed in the XMosaic
document window, and those which are displayed by some external viewer
program (a feature which I think is great).  If a file is displayed in
the document window, I can manipulate it in certain ways; I can view the
source with the menu item "File/Document Source...", I can save it to a
file via the "Save As..." button.  When a file is displayed in some
external viewer, I can do neither; typically XMosaic's view of "what
document is selected" is the directory from which I selected the actual
selected document.

It would be nice if when a Postscript, audio, or image file is selected
(or any type which uses an external viewer), XMosaic would put something
in the document window (maybe "Document foo://foo.bar.bletch/dir/name
being displayed via command `xv DOC'" or some such), and make the source
of the document manipulable via the "File/Document Source..." and "Save
As..." buttons.  Or in some other way unify the two classes.

(I feel that I should emphasize what a minor though annoying bug this is
in a really great piece of work :-).

Yup -- in 2.x (or whatever we call the Next Generation, this summer),
non-text datatypes will be represented iconically and one will be able
to save to file, print (if possible), pipe through external viewer,
display with default mechanism, reload over the network, or whatever,
through the GUI.  This will be part of the MIME support also.  And the
WYSIWYG editing.  (Promises promises.)

Perhaps so, perhaps not.  There's a difference between a multimedia
document and a hyperlinked document, as your experiments with embedded
images richly show.

Come now, so can images.  So why special-case them in XMosaic?  Because
your users are looking for multi-media, not just hypermedia.  Similarly,
HTML should allow embedded animations (very useful in documentation of
gestural interfaces, for one thing) or graphs or even other text.  I'm
basing my expectation of the power and utility of this mechanism on my
experience with Andrew and Slate, both of which have this feature. 
Typically what is shown for embedded sound, for instance, is a small
(tiny) control panel which allows control over the speed and amount of
the sound inset that is actually played, along with a label.

The other thing is, if you can specify the data for one of these
embedded things directly in the HTML document, you can then avoid some
of the complexity/connectivity problems you mention.  That's what I
meant by "in-line data", as opposed to "in-line" presentation, which
both included and external data would, presumably, have.

Rob,

  Either I'm getting used to markup, or your message was the clearest
example I've ever seen.  The text just flowed. ;^)

<QUOTE AUTHOR="Rob Raisch <raisch@ora.com>">
<OPINION> I believe that HTML, like it's progenitor SGML, should be simply a
method of describing data, not how it should appear on the screen.  In fact, I
think that this is exactly the sentiment which Tim Berners-Lee has expressed to
us all regarding his vision of HTML. The formatting of lists and the flow of
text around graphics do not fit this definition.  If this is an incorrect
assessment of the role HTML needs to serve I would be very interested in hearing
from others. </OPINION>
</QUOTE>

<OBSERVATION>
   HTML alone, in it's current form, is inadequate to serve the needs of
our community.  It has been designed/cultivated to describe the structure
of documents in an abstract manner.  It assumes that presentation issues
are resolved by the particular client system via some specific rendering
process.
  However, the community of users and publishers is demanding presentation-
level markup capabilites.  For various reasons, publishers want to express
their vision of how a document should appear.
</OBSERVATION>

<QUESTION> What is the mechanism by which we can represent presentational
"hints" in WWW documents?  I call them "hints" because a client is always
free to ignore any markup it doesn't like or understand.

been taking place in comp.text, comp.text.sgml, and etc.  I would call your

(Someone will shortly begin firing 22 caliber rounds into my office[1],
 so I will leave this verbose.)

Claim:
  Textual inclusion is a fundamental indirection/abstraction mechanism,
  required if www is to scale in volume and duration.

Argument:
 1 Inlining of dynamic/living documents is needed.
 2 This can be done at server or at client.
 3 You sometimes(often?) dont want to do it at server.

Elaboration:
 1. What happens if you cant inline dynamic information?
    Options:
      - Copying, and then either maintaining consistency or
                                 accepting obsolence.
      - Hyperlinking to it, even when you need it in flow of the doc.
      - Doing both, and push the burden onto the human.
      - Giving up.
 2. ...
 3. ...

Mumbles:
  I have fuzzy recollection of a cern doc which mentions brewster at
TMC in cambridge.  He switches jobs.  Does tim 1- leave it outdated
(print model), 2- hand edit it every time brewster moves (toy system
model), or what?
  What if I wish to inline think.com's phone number or mailing address?
  Suppose I write a living document criticizing unix.  To illustrate
my point, I wish to quote some single FAQ entry.  Do I 1- copy it, thus
losing the benefit of improvements to the FAQ, 2- point to it, forcing
me to use a document structuring I didnt want, 3- periodically hand
edit it (not), 4- have an agent edit it, n- or what?
  Can I create a composite document with out either losing consistency
or looking like a gopher menu?
  Inlining, by virtue of making the web representation more powerful,
might be used to address other problems.
Caching might be addressed by something (remotely) like
<A HREF=<INLINE HREF="http://wwwnamed-host/cern-cache">/pub/mumble>cern</A>.
WWW cache inheretence then follows the DNS hierarchy.

Must go.

Clarification:
 [1] Ceiling lights being rehung from concrete.

But it is much more impressive and intuitive, when you click on an
image and it starts moving in place. Paradise Software Inc. have a demo
which shows a hypermedia newspaper. In that demo there are two images 
which serve as anchors to two movies. When you start the movies they 
will run at the location of the images. I showed the demo to a couple 
of people and all were very impressed.

RARE has set up a short study on network access to multimedia
information, which I am conducting.  I'm listening to the discussions on
extending HTML and HTTP with great interest. 

Talking to some of the potential USERS of multimedia information servers
(MMIS) and looking at their projects, I came up with a list of
requirements.  I know that WWW can do much of this, but not all, and it
seems that this might be a good time to mention some of these
requirements.  There are sections on Hyperlinks, Presentation (this
matches up with discussions on text flowing, inline images etc),
Searching, QoS and Management.  I'd be interested in comments. 

HYPERLINKS

It is clear that many applications require their users to be able to
navigate through the information base according to relationships
determined by the information provider - in other words, hyperlinks. 

Some "hypermedia" systems are in fact simply hypertext, in that they
require the source anchor of a hyperlink to be in a text node.  A true
hypermedia system allows hyperlinks to have their source anchors in
nodes of any media type.  This allows a user to click the mouse on a
component of a diagram or on part of a video sequence to cause one or
more related nodes to be retrieved and displayed. 

Some hypermedia systems allow target anchors of a hyperlinks to be
finer-grained than a whole node - eg the target anchor could be a word
or a paragraph within a text document.  It is not clear to me whether
this is a critical requirement.

PRESENTATION

Related information of different media types must be capable of
synchronised display.  The synchronisation may be in time and/or space. 
For instance, an image may have an associated text caption which should
be retrieved at the same time as the image and displayed adjacent to it,
perhaps in a window which the user can scroll.  A sound clip may have
some associated text (perhaps a translation) which must be displayed in
sync with the sound, eg in an automatically-scrolled window. 

SEARCHING

Database-type applications require varying degrees of sophistication in
retrieval techniques.  Typically, non-text nodes form the major data of
interest.  Such nodes have associated descriptions, which may be plain
text, or may be structured into fields.  Users need to be able to search
the descriptions, obtain a list of "hits", and select nodes from that
list to display.  Searching requirements vary from simple keyword
searching to full-text indexing (with or without Boolean combinations of
search words), to full SQL-style database retrieval languages.

The user must be able to retrieve and display all the information in a
record in a single operation.  (This may involve several separate
retrieval operations "under the hood", but the user should not be aware
of this.)

QUALITY OF SERVICE

User toleration of delay in computer systems depends on user perception
of the nature of the requested action.  If the user believes that no
computation is required, tolerable delays are of the order of 0.2s.  If
the user believes the action he or she has requested the computer to
perform is "difficult" - for instance a computation of some form - then
a tolerable delay is of the order of 2s.  Users tend to give up waiting
for a response after about 20s.

Such user expectations are difficult to meet, particularly for
voluminous multimedia data.  There are several ways of alleviating this
problem, some of which are described below. 

 *	Give clues that fetching a particular item might be timeconsuming -
	simply quoting the size may be sufficient. 

 *	Display a "progress" indicator while fetching data. 

 *	Allow the user to interact with other, previously fetched information
	while waiting for data to be fetched. 

 *	Allow several fetches to be performed in parallel. 

 *	Pre-fetch information which the client software believes the user
	will wish to see next. 

 *	Cache information locally. 

 *	Where multiple copies of the same information are held in different
	network locations, fetch the "nearest" copy.  This is (sometimes)
        known as "anycasting". 

 *	Offering multiple views of image or video data at different
	resolutions and therefore sizes enable the user to select a balance
	between speed of retrieval and data quality. 

 *      Make provision for using isochronous data streams (if available)
        for audio and video.

MANAGEMENT

In order to support applications involving real-money information
services (eg academic publishing) and learning/assessment applications,
there must be a reliable and secure access control mechanism.  A simple
password is unlikely to suffice - Kerberos authentication procedures are
a possibility. 

Users must be able to determine the charge for an item before retrieving
it (assuming that pay-per-item will be a common paradigm - alternatives
such as pay-per-call, pay-per-duration are also possible).  Access
records must be kept by the information server for charging purposes. 

Learning applications have similar requirements, except that the purpose
here is not to charge for information retrieved, but to monitor and
perhaps assess a student's progress. 

OTHER

Another requirement which has escaped from the above list is the ability to
specify in a hypermedia document a mail address, in such a way that the
user can click on it to invoke his/her mailer with the address ready
in the To: field.

The current DTD specifies that anchor text is PCDATA. This perhaps too strong
as it rules out ANY tags occurring between <A> and the </A>. The same is true
for the tags: <EM>, <TT>, <STRONG>, <B>, <I>, <U>, <CODE>, <SAMP>, <KBD>,
<VAR>, <DFN> and <CITE>.

The DTD also gives limitations on which tags can occur within lists - namely
the preceding tags, together with <LI> and <P>, but *no* nested lists.

I have a feeling that most people find the SGML DTD rather hard to follow
in detail. Goldfarb's account of SGML almost seems to go out of its way
to make life difficult for the newcomer. Perhaps we need to supplement the
HTML DTD with a more accessible BNF style description.

An easy to understand, yet precise description of the core HTML is needed.
I feel we would also benefit from some guidelines for dealing with bad HTML,
and pointers to experimental extensions.

My first browser did this - but I got fed up with all the error messages!
Perhaps the browser should just report the document as not conforming
to the core spec and leave it to a separate program to generate a full report.

The problem here is twofold.  Firstly, the old HTTP version
only knows about two formats, plain text and HTML.  It distinguishes  
text from HTML by prefixing it with <PLAINTEXT>.  Now it is possible  
of course to get a postscript file returned as "plain text" and then
treat it as postscript.  Secondly, though, there is a bug in XMosaic
which causes it not to look at the <PLAINTEXT> let alone strip it  
off.  This is because (contrary to the protocol) it guesses from the
URL (which is specified as being opaque and meaningless to hte  
client) what sort of a format it is and pipes it directly to
ghostview.  I guess it doesn't strip off the PLAINTEXT because it
just wants to open up a pipe.

I have put a -DXMOSAIC-HACK patch into the W3 library to allow the
library to return data to clients which have not said they can handle  
it. before that they would just say "sorry" if you wanted a picture  
and could only handle plain text. I hadn't realised there was this  
extra problem with the <PLAINTEXT> with mosaic.  The trouble is, if  
the <PLAINTEXT> is left out, everything returned will be parsed
(by conforming HTTP0 clients) as HTML.

Beware of course that if you put up data using this server, there are  
lots of people out there with the line mode browers who, instead of  
getting the postscript in a usable form which they can print, will  
get it parsed as HTML!

Moving to full HTTP is better.  The line mode browser and various  
others include the version 2 cern library which includes the full  
HTTP (or at least, this part of it).  I hope it isn't too much in the  
long term for xmosaic.  All multimedia browers should use the full  
HTTP. Otherwise servers can only assume that they can only handle  
ASCII and HTML.

BTW Marc I have put in the porting mods from xmosaic's tcp.h
into tcp.h in the new library ...

This is all my fault for not getting libwww v2 out earlier in the  
xmosaic development schedule.

Your proposed tags are similar to the ones I suggested some time ago.
I ended up with two new tags: <input> for bools, free text, dates
integers and floats, and <select> for single and multi-valued list
selections which can be visualized as the browser chooses. Tim suggested
that rather than introducing a new tag, the <LI> tag should be used for
specifying list members. It would take an optional parameter to specify
selected choices. Other ideas concern the need for indicating that fields
are currently in error or can't be altered (grayed out).

We seem to have several ways of passing the field contents to the server:

    a)  as part of the URL following a "?"
    b)  as part of the URL using variable substitution
    c)  as part of the TEXTSEARCH method with HTRQ/V1.0
    d)  as part of a new 'method'

One suggestion that would fit well with existing practice is to specialise
the format of the search string. The BNF for URL's defines the search string
as zero or more alphanumeric or symbol chars, where the symbols belong
to the set: "$-_@!%^&*()."  You can then pass a list of field values using
the BNF:

    QUERY  ::=  FIELD [+QUERY]
    FIELD  ::=  name@value | name@(VALUES)
    VALUES ::=  value [&VALUE]

e.g. "name@value+name@(value&value)

The use of brackets for multiple values allows servers to continue to treat
the characters &, ^, ! for logical operators.

Any comments?

The current HTML standard as defined by the DTD forbids nested lists. It is
therefore no surprise that the line mode browser doesn't support them. Other
browsers have made extensions to the standard. It is certainly true, that the
SGML DTD doesn't specify how such lists should be rendered, however, the
accompanying description should provide sufficient guidelines, that authors
will have an adequate idea of how each construct will appear. The current
document says for example:

   "The representation of a list is not defined here, but a bulleted list for
    unordered lists and a sequence of numbered paragraphs for an ordered list
    would be quite appropriate. Other possibilities for interactive displays
    include  embedded scrollable browse panels."

The current spec needs extension to define what kinds of nesting of list tags
are permitted together with some comments on rendering issues.

I think you are mistaken here. Forms can be defined in terms of a collection
of fields with specified types and allowed values. My proposal does indeed
do this - leaving it up to the browser to decided how to render the form. One
may also want to make it possible for authors to pass hints to browsers, but
this is a separate issue. Tables too, can be specified without getting mixed
up in the details of rendering, although some layout hints are useful.

Subject: help! need URL's & guidance for K-12 demo Friday
Message-Id: <CMM.0.88.736047305.strata@apple.com>

I have just grabbed the xmosaic binaries and report so far so good on a 
Sun 4/330 running 4.1.3.  Haven't tested sound stuff yet, will try it
on a Sparc2 tomorrow.  I have some questions, though....

First of all, where can I find some good multimedia stuff for a demo
of Mosaic to a local K-12 unified school district?  I just got dragged
into this at the last minute, you know how these things are.  There's
some good stuff in the Mosaic demo document, but I'm hoping to find
stuff for both teachers and kids elsewhere, preferably at least some
of it education related.  Are there URL's for good GIF sites,
especially anything Space related?  I would love JPL or shuttle
images, and sound files of astronaut stuff would go over really well.
We'll be doing this over a T1 link, and are assuming a T1 for this
particular site, so the more the merrier, and huge files are not a
problem!

A source for reading netnews via XMosaic would be good as well, I want
to test the news interface but got a "disallowed" message when I tried
to enter any of the groups in the netnews page.  I want to demo the
"kids" and "sci" groups in particular to these folks; if the news
interface is like the rest of mosaic, I feel pretty confident that
K-12 can handle it trivially.  This was in the demo doc, by the way--
the "Usenet" under the Documents menu doesn't even get me that far.

This brings me to another question-- a number of the most important
documents in the "Documents" menu seem to be inaccessible.  The
"Information by Subject" "Data Sources by Service" and some other
"meta-lists" are refusing to serve the documents.  Some sites may be
inaccesible, but (for instance) I am seeing plenty of other stuff from
info.cern.ch so why not these documents?

Has anyone prepared an initial document which has resources for K-12
teachers and students?  How about for small businesses or independent
researchers?  The Gopher interface is great, but you can't easily
distinguish between full-text documents, book reviews, and so on.  The
folks who were looking over my shoulder this afternoon were quite
disappointed when much of "the good stuff" turned out to be course
descriptions, not documents.

With respect to WAIS, I keep getting these WAIS pages that say <big
type> foo.bar.baz is a WAIS server for some topic, but where do I go
from there?  The "search keyword" is grayed out, even when the text
says "a WAIS server which supports keyword searches on such and so".
What might I be doing wrong?  Clicking in the "Search Keyword" area or
actual box sometimes gets me a text prompt but it just beeps when I
type!

Given the cynicism of much of today's youth, you can understand why I
want to overcome some of these issues before the demo Friday morning!
Any help is much appreciated!

One more question-- the school system in question may decide that it
wants these (and other) tools but doesn't want to maintain their own
Unix hosts, just to connect via Xterms or somesuch.  I have looked at
the Mosaic copyrights and it looks like it would be legal for one of
the commercial providers to put the binaries up or run a web server or
whatever for the school system.  But what if the commercial provider
wanted to let their regular customers use it too?  Would that still be
legit, as long as their customers are buying an account, not buying
Mosaic or any specific rights to use it?  I don't want to install this
for some provider and then find out that I'm helping to violate UIUC's
copyright!  Guidance on this would be appreciated....


Thanks for any help on any of these; probably best to send to me and
not the list.  I'll be happy to summarize the URL info if I get any,
and will certainly pass on any K-12 demo-style document I end up
generating.

X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.2

The vote was successful for the creation of the group by a wide margin.
I tried to post the vote yesterday, but uunet seems to be really confused,
and it couldn't find the moderator of news.announce.newgroups, despite
all best efforts.  Uunet fixed that today.  (Then I sent this notice
out to www-talk, and it bounced.  Then / on our mail machine filled up
and I lost the response from the postmaster at uunet about the
mail to news.announce.newgroups.  I love mail).

The procedure at this point is that I "post" the results (they go
to the moderator of news.announce.newgroups, and he posts).  Five days
after they are posted, if there are no major complaints, the moderator
will send out a message to create the newsgroup.

If anybody happens to know why I can't send mail to uunet, that would
help things a bit.

Tom,

I sympathize with your mail sufferings, and apologize for the
bounce from www-talk.   I also apologize for everyone trying to
do anything with www on info.cern.ch yesterday.  An auto NFS mounted
file system couldn't automount for no reason I could find and
then between 1am and 9am the darn thing fixed itself for no
resaon I could find either. Maybe the reason you can't mail uunet
is someone has an nfs mounted disk somewhere. :-}

Hopefully others can help with more general recommendations, but I
suggest you take a look at.....
        
        http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/evl/Welcome.html

.....although there are some SGI-only images and animations in there,
it's got a lot of good, impressive, content-filled (I can say that
since I didn't create it) multi/hypermedia stuff that can be viewed on
any color platform.

If you have a valid NNTP/netnews server available to you, set
environment variable NNTPSERVER to it before starting Mosaic and then
you can access any group with URL's of form......

        news:alt.hypertext

......or whatever.

CERN (the source of those documents) had machine problems today.  I
see they're back up now (2:30am Central time).

Others can maybe help there -- the global answer is that the Internet
isn't yet a library in any reasonable sense of the word is because
nobody's paying anyone to make it a library.  Hopefully through the
use of technology like WWW/WAIS/Gopher etc. this will one day happen.
But there are pockets of definite non-technical content here and
there.

Suggest you contact us directly (mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  Sounds like
a strange problem.

Suggest you contact us directly wrt this too -- the threshold from our
side is that if a commercial concern is distributing and/or modifying
Mosaic in a commercial context, as part of commercial activities, then
it's probably be a good idea to come talk to us.  Everything else is
free (including internal company use, btw).

Tom Bruce broght up the question of allowing
entities for more than the ISOLatin1 set.
Anyone care to take on defining a reasonable set?
(Like not all unicode?)

We would need
	
	names from some standard,
	
	suggested translations into latin 1 equivalents
	for those without them?)

Tom's initial need was for section sign, pilcrow (paragraph mark),
mu and a few other Greek characters in common use outside Greek,
and the registered and copyright signs.

I am usingthe term "HMML" to refer to the next DTD following on from
HTML, to distinguidsh from HTML which I think should stick at latin1
for the sake of stability.

Hypertext of the consitution of the US? link from
http://fatty.law.cornell.edu.:80/usr2/wwwtext/lii.table.html
find it from subjects->law.  US students are all supposed to thrive
on this, others may not be so excited!

The vatican exhibit is just incredible, and you have to take a tour  
there if you have time. URL is ftp://seq1.loc.gov/pub/vatican.exhibit
or find it under Subjects->Literature and Art.  Unfortunately there  
is no guiding hypertext... so look under exhibits and then under  
(say) music.  Bring up the Music.txt in one window, and on a cloned  
window keep the list of pictures hich you can bring up as you read  
through the text. These are some beautiful pictures, and a serious  
commentary.

[A volunteer to hypertext this and show them the result? These guys
need a few pointers in their text and a fast http server. But if
you don't mind directory listsings, its great as it is]

How about the CIA fact book as an atlas?  Find the index under  
subjects: geography. Look for a country, then try "world". Sorry, no  
maps.

It is really difficult to know which line you should take as a demo,
there are so many things to show.  With a vt100 you probably want to  
use Lynx.  Pity you can't use the fancy stuff above!

One example:

follow

Subjects -> computing -> unix manuals -> sun manuals -> keyword  
search, find "time", -> time.1v

Now, point out:

1.	We have used a mixture of searchs and jumps to get where
	we wanted

2.	We now have some very useful links offered, including
	those back to the top of the manu pages for sun, and
	also a link to the equivalent page in the HP, pyramid, and
	ultrix manuals (useful for comparison!), and to other
	man pages called "time" in different sections of the sun
	manual.
	
3.	These links were all generated automatically by a program:
	noone had to write them.

What's the problem?

Take a test case:

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Paper/www-server-guide.ps

This is a postscript document. I can read it with XMosaic (0.9), I  
can read it using:
WWW LineMode Browser version 2.04-beta (WWW Library 2.04)
on a next.

The CERN server is now at 2.04, but as far as I know the
document has been has been readable for some time.
There was a fix (the -DXMOSAIC_HACK library compilation option
mentioned in previous messages) which was introduced into
the library recently, but this does seem to solve the problem.
We will have to keep this -DXMOSAIC_HACK in until xmosaic
goes to v2.

If you have a document you can't pick up, then what it its URL?
Could be a server update would help.

There are two parts to this, auto-inlining and inlining on selection.

There is nothing to prevent browers from inlining on selection right now,
though it would be nice if you could pass a window id to xv and not have
to build in all that code.  Having browsers and external viewers cooperate
should be an easy project.  Any volunteers?

I think in 10 years auto-inlining anchors (for other than iconic purposes,
which is what <A><IMG...></A> really does) will be considered the GOTO of
hypertext.  Good document design should minimize them, but they are handy
when you are in deep shaving cream.

It talks about REL=Embed which is pretty interesting for doing outlines.

Wouldn't adding a <IMG ALIGN="flow"> hint do the job?  I haven't researched
all the different ways people like to flow text around images but I think
this would solve 80% of the problem (which is that people don't want all
that empty space).  I don't see anything preventing browsers from flowing
text right now.

Is anyone using MacX (an Xterminal emulator for macintoshes) as their
X-server for xmosaic?  If so, which xmosaic binary (sun, dec, alpha,
...)  are you using, and does it work reasonably well? 

Is this a reasonable thing to be doing or is it completely nuts :-) ?

I have a modified version of xv that supports this.  I'll clean it up

Building viewers so that they can also operate on some pre-existing
window, instead of just creating their own, is an excellent idea.  I'm
always surprised when otherwise-wonderful viewers, such as Ghostscript
or xv, don't do this  from the start.  Probably just doesn't occur to
their authors.  Also, it seems tricky to do with most (all that I know
of) Xt-based toolkits.

Ghostscript 2.5.2 does this.
    GHOSTVIEW="__window_id__"
    DISPLAY="whatever"
    export GHOSTVIEW DISPLAY

Ghostview 1.4.1 uses this feature.
Now we just have to fix xloadimage, mpeg_play, (and you said you had a
fixed xv).

Clearly Ghostview talks to Ghostscript in some fashion.  Is the actual
communication protocol between the two documented in some fashion other
than the source code?

It opens a pipe and talks postscript to it I'm sure.

Yes, it works fine... I believe MacX is an X11R4 release of X and thus
not all fonts requested by Xmosaic are available (about 4 fonts in
total I think)... any Xmosaic client (sun, dec, etc) ought to work.
I depend on the IBM xmosaic client and it works fine... opening
telnet sessions does not work, "aixterm -v" is used for that and
it fails when it can't get the "vtsingle" font.

Ah, I had hoped that you might actually know.  There is an additional
protocol using X Client Events that runs between ghostscript and
ghostview.  Also, the environment variable protocol you described seems
to be more complex; it's more like

    setenv GHOSTVIEW "<window-id-1>  <window-id-2>"

where <window-id-1> is the window on which ghostscript is supposed to
render, and <window-id-2> is the window to which ghostscript sends
events, in order to run this out-of-band additional protocol.  I believe
that

    setenv GHOSTVIEW "<window-id>"

will also work in some fashion, though I don't know to what extent the
protocol will be crippled.

Subject: Interapplication communication

Folks:

The talk about Ghostscript prompts me to raise a question... MS
Windows incorporates protocols for local communication between
applications (two of 'em, in fact).  They seem vaguely similar in
purpose to the protocols mentioned by the folks discussing
Ghostscript...

I would very much like to build some recognition of these into anchors, so that local apps
could be fired up/communicated with by some means beyond recognition
of file extensions (I have a particular purpose in mind which involves
feeding queries to a proprietary database client, but there are a few
billion more uses for such a thing).  Question is, what's the best way
to do the URL? I could invent something local to the Windows
environment, but it would seem that as there are analogues for other
platforms something general would be handy.  Or have I missed the
point, with this problem long since resolved under some other scheme?

Regards,
Tb.

Marc,

In "http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/SDG/Software/MacSoftDesc.html" you have
used an unusual variant of description lists:

    DL>
    <DT> <I> Version: </I> 1.0
    <DT> <I> System requirements: </I>
    </DL>

There are <DT> tags without any corresponding <DD> tags. Currently, the
HTML spec seems to require each <DT> to be paired with a <DD>. Furthermore
there must be at least one <DT> in the list.

Now are you suggesting that we relax this requirement?
If so what should be permitted with in <DL> ... </DL>?

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

Aaaaagh!  I didn't write that document.  Mosaic has been trained to be
very liberal about what goes into a DL just because various documents
already on the net were doing very strange things (like above) and now
I see that our own Publications group is doing them -- sigh.  But I
didn't do it myself.

Speaking of unusual variations....in 

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/evl/cave/cave.html

I find....

   <ul>
   <li><h2> Stuff </h2>
   <li><h2> More Stuff </h2>
   </li>

elsewhere I have seen the complimentary

   <h1>This is <ul><li>some<li>stuff</ul></h1>

Clearly someone has found such constructs useful, but they seem to be against my 
feelings for what <h1>/<h2> mean, and are unlikely to produce the desired 
results on most existing browsers. 

Do people feel that constructs such as this should be supported? 

Presumably the DTD says something explicit about whether the above is legal HTML 
or not, but (hoepfully) most off the people producing HTML will not (want) to 
read the DTD, so I feel that (in addition to the DTD) a document that describes 
in a more informal way which combination of tags is likely to be portable across 
browsers is badly needed.

I think this is another place where variables are needed (cf. Jay
Weber's message of a few days ago). Then one could have URLs of the
form:

Tim, my apologies if you've fixed this in libwww v2 already, but...

It seems that the reason Mosaic will present some of you with lists of
article headers of news groups just fine, but then refuse to read any
articles ("430 No article by message-id
<1993Feb3.134631.2976@ncsa.uiuc.edu>, sorry."), is that some nntp
servers out there are just plain broken.

How, you ask?  RFC 977 directs news servers to return articles
identified by article ID when sent a command of form:

        ARTICLE <1993Feb3.134631.2976@ncsa.uiuc.edu>

....and also when sent a command of form:

        ARTICLE 335

....where 335 is the article number.  Right?

Well, some servers only allow the latter method.  This seems strange.
Does anyone know what I'm missing here?

Thanks,
Marc

Subject: Announcing tkWWW 0.7, the first WYWSIWYG X11 HTML editor


tkWWW Version 0.7 alpha (joe@athena.mit.edu)
--------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?

-------------
World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext project which seeks to build a
world wide network of hypertext links.  There are several different
browsers for this system including a simple tty interface.  For a 
demo of the terminal browsers for WWW, telnet to the following sites:

 telnet info.cern.ch or telnet 128.141.201.74 (SWISS)
 telnet eies2.njit.edu or telnet 128.235.1.43 (USA [NJ])
 telnet vms.huji.ac.il or telnet 128.139.4.3  (ISRAEL)
 telnet info.funet.fi or telnet 128.214.6.100 (FINLAND)

 and login as "www"

Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily.

tkWWW is a Tk interface to (WWW).

it is very easy to make modifications and extensions to the system.
tkWWW is the first X11 browser with the ability to edit HTML!!!!!

What has changed since 0.6?
---------------------------
Rough WYWSIWYG editor!!!!!!!!!!! 
   (with help from Nathan Torkington <Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz>)
Bug fixes courtesy of Jon Hurley (jhn@biosym.com)

and I got a lot of name conflicts which are the results of (new) long names

If no one is planning on doing this I would be willing to volunteer -- I

I have found a problem in retrieving news thru both www (linemode) and
xmosaic. Both correctly pick up my news server name, and if I follow the
links from `By Type' thru `Network News' to a specific group, both programs
correctly list the articles, but cannot access the article texts, giving
me instead the message `Connecting to NewsHost ...' and then coming back
with `Back, Quit or Help:'

It is clear that both programs are expecting articles to be stored in files
with names set to the message-id. I have never encountered a system which
does this, and my own server runs plain vanilla nntp and Cnews, which puts
articles in files whose names are the article numbers (sequential, 1+).

As the www server is capable of finding the directory (and is presumably
grepping for 'Subject:' and piping the results back into HTML---or is it
actually opening each file in turn?) could not a simple addition to the code
see if the files are named (=message-ID) or numbered (=message-number) and
act accordingly?

If this is not possible, where do I find a news system which stores articles
under message-ID filenames instead?

Peter,

Your www program is not contacting a www server at all. When the
document address specifies "news:..." the it talks NNTP.
NNTP says nothing about how articles are  stored, but allows
one to ask for them by Message-id.  Sounds like your newsreader
doesn't have the articles. There should be an error message.
Try
	www -v news:a7fd5104@random.se
to see what is going on.

I have found a problem in retrieving news thru both www (linemode)  
and
xmosaic. Both correctly pick up my news server name, and if I follow  
the
links from `By Type' thru `Network News' to a specific group, both  
programs
correctly list the articles, but cannot access the article texts,  
giving
me instead the message `Connecting to NewsHost ...' and then coming  
back
with `Back, Quit or Help:'

It is clear that both programs are expecting articles to be stored in  
files
with names set to the message-id. I have never encountered a system  
which
does this, and my own server runs plain vanilla nntp and Cnews, which  
puts
articles in files whose names are the article numbers (sequential,  
1+).

As the www server is capable of finding the directory (and is  
presumably
grepping for 'Subject:' and piping the results back into HTML---or is  
it
actually opening each file in turn?) could not a simple addition to  
the code
see if the files are named (=message-ID) or numbered  
(=message-number) and
act accordingly?

If this is not possible, where do I find a news system which stores  
articles
under message-ID filenames instead?

I run xmosaic on HPUX w/ few problems (don't bother trying to
open it on a Sun server -- only problem I know about).

The upshot of this is that this is the same problem I sent mail to
www-talk about a few days ago.  Many news servers do not honor the RFC
977 (NNTP protocol spec) requirement to support fetching articles by
article ID -- they only allow fetching by group and message number.

This is a big, big problem.  There really aren't any answers, except
to have one's news admin switch to a working NNTP server (I'm not sure
which versions of what are working and broken, only that some servers
work and some don't).  URL's aren't currently designed to reference
articles by group and number, and as Tim pointed out this isn't really
feasible, since message number is a very transient property.

If anybody has any other ideas, please post them to the list....

Cheers,
Marc

If you are looking to replace your NNTPD I'd recommend INN.  In
addition to being really quick, it has fine grained control on
who can and can't read news articles.  (For instance, it lets
me offer Reuters news access to single users on other machines.)

A news guru colleague has pointed out here that my nntp server does
support retrieval by article-ID, it's just that it doesn't work...:-)
It seems my history file is broken, so I'm attempting repair (although
why this should be I cannot understand). My understanding is that this
failure is fairly widespread, but can someone please point me at a site
where retrieval thru www _does_ work, so I can institute some comparisons?

Hi all,

I'm not sure this is the correct group for this, I only joined
a couple of days ago. But...

I have setup an experimental web service here on 

	http://web.nexor.co.uk/

It has the usual links to other places about, some sales info about
the company, and a link to Warchie: an archie gateway I wrote that
shows its findings as links (host, directory and file), and allows
substring and regexp searching too.

I'd appreciate any comments on either.

Here is the server documentation:
    http://www.bsdi.com/server/httpd.html
Here is where the code lives:
    http://www.bsdi.com/server/
See this for the latest information:
    http://www.bsdi.com/server/overview.html

The whole server is only 50K of perl source.  The base server is only
410 lines (13K, that includes the directory browser).  The rest of the
bulk is 13K of documentation and 22K for the various gateways (1441 lines
total).

This server is based on the perl server developed at cs.indiana.edu
by Marc VanHeyningen.  See:
    http://cs.indiana.edu/perl-server/intro.html
    http://cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/mvanheyn.html
I did some work to make the base code more portable and then I've
been adding gateways like crazy.

I've been running it for several weeks now adding a little bit each night,
so it's fairly stable.  You can try out various feature by browsing our
server at http://www.bsdi.com/.  Please keep in mind that currently this
system is on a 56K line so if things are slow you might try back later.
I'll be moving it to a faster net at some point in the near future, but
it will be transparent to the user (it'll keep the www.bsdi.com name).

This server is NOT supported in any way but feel free to send me comments
or bug fixes.  Note that some of the gateways are designed to work on a
BSD/386 system and might require some porting to work on other systems
(the date gateway is a good example).  I've tried to provide some reasonable
documentation for the server so that it will be easier for people to hack
on it.  If you add any neat feature please let me know.

If you think of a good name for it let me know.

Features:
    The Date and Time Gateway
       See the data and time in any timezone (demo)

    The Finger Gateway (with faces support)
       Finger people (demo)

    The Directory Browser
       Include last mod time and size and file/directory indicator.
       Check out http://www.bsdi.com/server/ for an example.

    The Fortune Gateway
       Get a fortune cookie (demo)

    Calendar
       The current months calendar (or you can specify year or month/year)
       (demo)

    Restricted Access Directories
       restrict access by account number and IP address.

    Image Decoding
       Some tools to support image decoding when browsers are able to
       send the x, y coordinates of the mouse click when you select
       the image.  If you have xmosaic and would like an advance demo
       of this check out http://www.bsdi.com/demo/hypermedia.html.
       The patches required for xmosaic 1.0 are pointed to by that file.
       PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, don't use them for production code.
       Only use them for this demo.  I'm hoping I can get support
       for this in xmosaic 1.1 (to do it right requires changing
       <IMG SRC...> to support something like <IMG ISMAP SRC...>
       to enable the new code only on images that support it.

    Directory Search
       Allows regexps on a whole directory hierarchy in a simple fashion.
       Quick enough for about 50 files or 1MB on low volume servers (1
       second search time on a 486DX2/66 running BSD/386).  Above that
       you need something like WAIS.

CWIS-L@WUVMD.BITNET  is the list.  I assume a normal listserv

Subject: Explicit Linking is Impossible
Date: Tue, 4 May 93 11:10:35 EDT

At relatively small scales, it is possible to create hypertext
where authors hand craft the links between various places, say
via typical IDREF mechanisms.  Given a "standard" document of
100 pages, one author can reasonably manage to create say 1000
links within that 100 pages.  We do it as a matter of course
within IBM.  Across a library of 10 such books, we can manage
crafting 100 links from each book to the other books, but just
barely.  The cost is the cost not of initially creating the
links, but of maintaining them as the documents change during
development.  This can just be managed within one library where
all the books are finished and delivered at about the same time.

The next order of magnitude up would be linking across libraries.
This is impossible once the number of cross-library links goes
above about 50 because of maintenance problems--there are simply
not enough hours in the day or people on the job to create, maintain,
and test these links.  The next order of magnitude up (cross-enterprise
linking) is so clearly impossible as to be not worth considering.
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [emphasis added -marc]

Thus my contention that explicit linking is impossible at large
scales.  Even if you apply tools at one order of magnitude to
make the impossible possible (say a database system to track
links and manage changes), the next order of magnitude increase
will be impossible.  With change management and tracking, the
human element cannot be eliminated and you quickly reach the
practical limit at which humans can manage change.

Note that within IBM, and specifically within the Networking
Systems line of business, we are now at the cross-library linking
stage.  Using the BookManager product, we are creating, by hand,
explicit hyperlinks between the NetView, VTAM, NCP, and related
product libraries.  We think we can manage a relatively small
number of links at this level, but there's no way we could do
it at any larger scale.  We need to move up to the next order
of magnitude (cross-enterprise linking), but we can't with the
explicit-link-based tools we have today.

Note that when I say explicit or hand-crafted links, I mean
only from the author's perspective.  Exoterica's experience
with the Cinemania project is instructive here.  If I understand
it correctly, they used declarative markup in the SGML source
to enable creation of all links associatively, and then bound
those links explicitly in the derived form that was actually
delivered.  From the author's viewpoint, all the links were
implicit, but from the final application's viewpoint, they
were all explicit.

The cost of hypertext is the cost of creating and maintaining
the links.  I don't have any numbers, but it's pretty clear
>from my experience with the extensive hypertext we've created
in Networking Systems, that the cost of maintenance is not
a linear function of the number of links, but increases dramatically
(geometrically?) with the number of links, compounded by the
degree to which the linked objects' schedules are not synchronized
and the life span of the linked objects.

Marc, thanks for forwarding this message.  Perhaps I should start
reading comp.text.sgml.  I am quite new to all of this, so I don't
know what has been discussed, and what views you different people
might have.  My limited experience of writing HTML documents and
converting old plain text documents to HTML makes me agree with Eliot
Kimber's conclusions.

Adding and maintaining hypertext links up--back--forward between
chapters, sections and subsections is so easy, that I have already
automated it.  Adding hypertext links between a text and an alphabetic
index (or a dictionary) should be as easy, and just as easy to make
automatically.  But manually keeping track of hypertext links between
a text that I maintain and another text that someone else maintains,
would be next to impossible.

I don't know, Marc, what your seemingly sarcastic two line remark
means.  If you mean tbat maintaining hypertext links within large
collections of texts is easy and affordable, if you have good tools
for this, perhaps you could enlighten me and other people about this?

Thanks, Marc and NCSA, for X Mosaic.  Is there an NCSA HTML editor
too?  Today I have GNU Emacs.  I would like two Mosaic windows, and to
create hypertext links between the two documents by clicking a mouse
button.  If the destination document is maintained by someone else, he
should be notified that I have a link going there, so he doesn't
rename or reorganize his document without notifying me again.

It's not necessary to make really deep explicit links to other
people's hypertext; often times it's enough to pre-load a search that
takes people near the right place.  E.g. you don't say "page 342 of
ISBN 1-56592-027-9" you say "Look up the section on environment
variables in the O'Reilley MH book".

Authors do this all the time - if you can assume a good index (or do
automatic indexing and be prepared for some slop) you can get quite a
bit of the effort done.

It was just a joke... fyi, I'm an ex-IBM'er, and it amuses me greatly
to see the "we can do anything, and if we can't, it's not possible"
mentality still in action.

No, I don't think that maintaining hypertext links within large
collections of texts is currently easy and quote-unquote affordable,
and I don't have any magic tools, but that has nothing to do with
whether or not such a task is "impossible".  Limitations of current
technology should not be extrapolated to judge possibility or
impossibility; I would have thought the Wright brothers taught us that
principle some time ago.

Pardon, however, the humor, 
Marc

What exactly does "pre-load a search" mean, and how do I implement
this in an HTML document?  Say that I want to refer to the WWW
Provider's Style Guide by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, for the section
about how big to make each document.  Now, all of you readers of
www-talk can find this manually, and have probably already read that
text, but that is not why someone invented hypertext and the
world-wide web.  How do I do this without explicitly saying
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/DocSize.html"?

What if Tim and his WWW service moves from CERN to a new place?  What
if Tim decides to rename "WWW/Provider/Style" to "WWWSTYLE.DIR"?  I
don't say that he would, but he certainly could, and that would be
like pulling the rug away from under my feet.  Would I fall and would
that hurt?  If someone can pull this rug, why should I stand on it?

I would be happier to refer to an ISBN number, because then I only
specify the publisher, and not the library where I found the book, and
there would be an organization for registering new ISBN numbers that
would stop an author from changing a documents name.

There are already number series for books (ISBN) and serials (ISSN).
What I seem to ask for is ISHN, or an International Standard for
Hypertext Numbers.  These would have to be longer than ISBN numbers,
because they would not only refer to books, but also to sections and
paragraphs within a book.  An author would register an ISHN for each
section or paragraph of his book, and other authors could only refer
to these numbers.  After that, the author must not change his book.
This sounds too complicated to me, so lets hear some better solutions!

Use indirection, make the anchors say "the part of the foobar manual about
blat" and then have a database that translates them to actual HREF's and/or
computes them on the fly.  There is no magic wand or silver bullet to
solve these problems, but you can make it easier to maintain when something
goes away.  In the local arena you can use backrefs to manage changes,
not so easy with global documents (though DOCid's and HTTP2 will solve
some of the problems).

There is nothing wrong with adding a layer of software beteen HTML
and whatever documents you are storing to make life easier.

Part of problem lies in the approach.  Hypertext is designed as a
distributed information management system (how else can you expect to put
a yottabyte of data online :-), and they are trying to do everything local
and then publish this whole big thing.  No doubt they are having problems.
No doubt that the problem they are trying to solve is hard.  The fact that
link complexity is non-linear isn't a new problem.  Every system that has
relationships has this problem, including human interaction.  This is the
big company/project problem and you can use some of the same techniques
to minimize its impact.

In summary, I agree that massive explicit linking is impossible, but it
isn't desirable either.  I like what Edward Vielmetti, just said about
it, he sums it up better than I.  Yes, there is a need for tools in this
area, keep in mind this is a VERY young technology (you can tell becuase
hypertext still means something, unlike older technologies like
Object-Oriented programming which have ceased to have any real meaning).
To me it's not hypertext if it's not interactive (authoring tools!) and
we aren't quite there yet.

tkWWW has editing functions (you can add links on the fly) but it needs
work before it's "production" quality.  The problem is that HTTP2 isn't
in place yet so you can't send the changes back to the server anyway.

This is what DOCid's are.  A namespace like DNS where you register
documents.  Someone just has to do it.

A large part of what you're talking about is coming, in the form of
the Uniform Resource Name or whatever it ends up being called.
Distributed hypertext is still in its infancy; be patient... (or
better yet, keep contributing ideas and criticisms).

Just a note: transparent addition of hyperlinks is one of my top
priorities for Mosaic this summer (they will initially be handled the
same way as personal annotations are now, and then extended along with
personal annotations into group/community/world sharing and
collaboration).  I'm planning on using the same user interface
Intermedia uses/used, btw (select the text of the hyperlink in one
window/document, choose "Start Link" from the menubar, select the text
for the target of the hyperlink in another window/document, choose
"Complete Link" from the menubar).  Anyone have better ideas?
(Something drag'n'drop might be nice...)

Also, I don't yet have a plan in place for tracking positions in
documents for this -- initially I'll probably use a combination of
character position plus context, so Mosaic will at least be able to
tell you when a hyperlink you made previously has become invalid due
to the text changing (it will then append it to the file, just like
annotations are now) -- unless a better idea comes along.  Suggestions
welcome...

Yow!  Still own stock??

these talk about UDI's a little:

I couldn't find much that talks about DOCid's directly (there isn't much
because they don't exist yet :-).  Anyone know where some docs are that
talk about this?  I've seen them but couldn't find them right now.

I thought about writing a perl script that retrieves and greps http

  What exactly does "pre-load a search" mean, and how do I implement
  this in an HTML document?  Say that I want to refer to the WWW
  Provider's Style Guide by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, for the section
  about how big to make each document.  Now, all of you readers of
  www-talk can find this manually, and have probably already read that
  text, but that is not why someone invented hypertext and the
  world-wide web.  How do I do this without explicitly saying
  href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/DocSize.html"?
  
Let's say that we had the equivalent of "archie" or "veronica" for
WWW.  Call it "spidey".  Then you could say
	href="spidey://spidey.msen.com:5000/DocSize.html"
(to match by file name) or	
	href="spidey://spidey.msen.com:5000/timbl+style+docsize"
or maybe even
	href="spidey://spidey.msen.com:5000/ISBN=2-012523-096-3+docsize"

Search #1 is the equivalent of the archie "-e" exact search.

Search #2 is the equivalent of a WAIS or Gopher search, with some
keywords; you can imagine a slightly enhanced version if you know that
the database is somehow structured.

Search #3 is what you would do if you do if major World Wide Web
collections had International Standard Book Numbers, and shows a
reference to an index in a book.

Each of these are probabilistic, but they should *both* get the user
close enough to the document to make it possible for them to find it
on ther own *and* not be immediately obsolete once the document
changes or moves.

  There are already number series for books (ISBN) and serials (ISSN).

ISSN numbers are useful and easy enough to get.  They are not as
useful as they could be because they are too short, too unstructured,
and because you don't have to pay for them.  There is a payment
mechanism keyed on ISSN numbers - in the US, the "Copyright Clearance
Center" - but it's done at the article level and is widely ignored.

ISBN numbers cost money, but not that much; you can put a number on a
document for not more than a buck or two, much less in quantity.
People on this list (O'Reilley in particular) already have them.  All
we need is a few more network publishers to get up to speed and we'll
be set.  ISBN numbers in the USA show up in "Books In Print" - if you
want to have Tim's "WWW Provider's Style Guide" show up in Books In
Print you better be prepared to send someone a copy (on disk or on
paper) if they decide to order it at the listed price :)

Yes, the solution you suggest (spidey) could work.  While the present
scheme is like "go to the Royal Library in Stockholm, 2nd floor, take
to the left, walk 20 meters, turn to the right, there it is on the
3rd shelf, 15th book from the left, page 257.", the spidey scheme is
like "I think that John Shakespare wrote something about dreaming in
the middle of the summer".  I would still prefer ISBN numbers.  When
will spidey be up and running?

Subject: Problems with httpd
X-Charset: ASCII
X-Char-Esc: 29


I compiled the httpd-server from CERN (version 2.04) on a sun-sparcstation 1+
with SUN/OS 4.1.3.

I started it from the command line with:

	httpd -R -v -p 3767

When I wanted to test the server with

	www http://w2.infosys.tuwien.ac.at:3767\
		/home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html

the server printed the following on the screen:


New anchor 4c240 has hash 99 and address
	`/home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html' 
HTAccess: loading document
	/home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html
HTFile: can't stat
	/home/w11/elmar/WWW///home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html
HTAccess: Opening
	`/home/w11/elmar/WWW///home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html'

FTP: Looking for /home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html
HTTPAccess: Can't find internet node name `'.
TCP: Error 2 in `errno' after call to FTP file load() failed.
        No such file or directory
HTAccess: Can't access `/home/w11/elmar/www/WWW/Commands.html'


Therefore I checked the file 'HTFile.c' and found that the filename is put
together in line 306 (function 'HTLocalName'):

	sprintf(result, "%s/WWW/%s/%s%s", home, access, host, path);
	
When I deleted this line and returned only the path, the server gave back
the information to the client which displayed it on the screen.

Because I have no debugger here, I couldn't test if this change will have
some unwanted consequences. Any ideas?

Sorry, you can't operate with no rules at all now.
Operation is defined by the first in priority of:

1.	-r <file> option, where <file> exists.

2.	a directory name on the command line, in which
	case a default rule file is assumed which just maps
	everything into that directory

3.	A rule file httpd.conf if that exists

4.	If no rule file exists and no directory name,
	a default rule file will be assumed which exports
	the directory /Public as in (2).

Operation without a rule file does not work as the path
sent is not a complete url, and the rule file must map
to a URL starting with file: .

I have fixed the online documentation to reflect that
the -R option should not be used.  (It was a
security hole anyway, as was documented!)

>(Something drag'n'drop might be nice...)

It might be simpler if you don't have to select "Complete link" from the
menubar, since the default expectation is that, apart from navigation
commands, the command following "Start Link" will anyway be "Complete
Link". Why not simply let the user press "return" or "enter" or something
like that once the destination has been selected? Something similar is used
in HyperCard: when you choose "Start Link" a little dialog window appears
on your screen which remains there while you navigate to the destination
(in the same or another window), and then you choose "Link" or "Cancel"
from the dialog. It does not make much difference with the scheme Marc
proposes, but slightly decreases the complexity of remembering and
selecting the "Complete link" command.

Drag and drop would also be nice, but the problem is that you would first
have to select the destination anchor on which the source anchor should be
dropped. Otherwise the system would not know whether you want to link to
the whole document, window, section, sentence, or word... Having to make
the selection beforehand would obviate the advantage of drag and drop
editing. You might avoid this by proposing a default selection for the
destination, e.g. the sentence in which you drop, but that would make the
default system rather inflexible.

A perhaps simpler possibility is that the text  being selected as a source
anchor S would be highlighted in a particular way (e.g. selecting with the
mouse by double-clicking or by clicking with the shift key), indicating the
entering of the "link mode". When another text chunk D somewhere else would
be selected the system would by default assume that you want to link the
former to the latter, and propose the dialog "Link S to D?" with "OK" or
"Cancel". Graphically this might also be represented by an arrow or line
starting from the source text and moving with the mouse to the destination
text being selected. The presence of the arrow would denote "link mode",
and as long as that mode is on, any selection would automatically be
interpreted as a destination anchor.

You can embed WAIS searches in URL's which is really the same thing.
Also, my server has a search package included so you can do this
pretty easily (some assembly required).

For an example the following directory is searchable.
    http://www.bsdi.com/info/lawsuit/
and you could embed a query in a link
    http://www.bsdi.com/ifno/lawsuit?frey
will pop you into a menu of press releases by Donnalyn Frey.

You have a goood point of the scalability of the web.  This has been
made by some people here who have the same wories.  A solution which
works in software systems is to have, in any work, a set of anchors
which are explicitly declared "public" just like a global
declaration of a routine.  This declation means that the author
will maintain that (named) entry point.  It may be that the server
will want to keep a table of entry points to map them onto real  
places, and indeed in the HTTP2 protocol there is a specified but
unimlplemented by anyone yet as far as I know (SBUAYAFAIK,
vapourware for short) facility for an HTTP server to return a new
URL as a name server, instead of the document.

Other anchors whch are not declared public would not be linkable to
outside the document. This would be a convention which you could
enforce locally.

This scheme scales quite well, as for any size entity (article,
chapter, book, shelf, department, library...) there would be,
independent of its internal size, a fixed number of global entry  
points, so the problem scales as log N ie better than the
organisation which wrote it. (Not a dig at IBM but a comment
on hierarchical management perhaps)


Ed's system of referiing to searches in the index
"Look up the section on environment
variables in the O'Reilley MH book"
is similar, though heuristic if you don't contract with
ORA that they there will always be a section on envirnonment
variables in the book.

Discovered by accident earlier today....

Hold your hand (the right one works best) up, and curl your pinky
down.  Three fingers are now sticking up.

Spread them apart (if you keep them together, you look like a Boy Scout.)

Now, it makes the letter "W" stand out reasonably clearly.  Plus,
you're sticking up 3 fingers, so it represents the number 3.  So it's
a W!  It's a 3!  It's W3!  What more could anybody possibly ask for in
an official WWW hand gesture?

Someobdy needs to develop a secret WWW handshake based on this.

In HTTP there is another SBNIBAYAFAIK feature that the client can
quote the "referee" (ie link source) when following a link. The
features is designed to allow backward links to be built up as the
forward links are followed.

If there exists an index which covers the area (like if I got around
to WAIS-idnexing all of that, you would quote something like

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext?style

and point the reader at the results of a wais serach for style in
the database.

	A big difference between the http deamon and the ftp daemon
	is the document name to filename mapping. Though I wish
	I had named the documents "/InformationSystems..." rather
	than "/hypertext", I won't change the document names even
	if I move the files. I will write a server which maps the  
document names into their new places. In fact, already you are
	spared making references to
	"/Net/dxcern/userd/timbl/hypertext..." thanks to the
	mapping.  Look at the mapping as a local name server so that
	within the server the path is in fact a name not an address.

	[Of course filenames aren't addresses either. I wouldn't like
	to have to count how many mappings occur before we get to
	the disk track/sector/cylinder numbers.]

> If someone can pull this rug, why should I stand on it?


	If I want to, I cn turn the server off. But I don't want to.
	It is in my interests to maintain the pointers.

Have you joined uri@bunyip.com to talk about naming and addressing
of document resources?  If not, you might like to. Mail uri-request  
of course not the list.

What will be the relationship between www-talk and 
comp.infosystems.www once it is formed. Will the newsgroup replace 
www-talk?...or should both continue? It the latter then what is the 
difference in their purpose, or should we just cross-post everything?

Well, consider that some of us don't have access to Usenet and the
news groups, so if the mailing list disappears, we disappear. (Believe it
or not, CNRI... home of the Internet Society is one such place).

I look forward to reading comp.infosystems.www INSTEAD of www-talk.
I hope to be able to unsubscribe from www-talk (unless the amount
of traffic on it goes way down).

At IETF last month we came up with the official hand gesture for
Internet, Combining the symbol for i, the symbol for net, and the symbol
for friends, it is formed by hooking the two pinkys together.

I vote to link the newsgroup and mailing list, the wais discussion has
become far less usefull now it is spread over the list wais-talk and the
group comp.infosystems.wais, not to mention two (or maybe three) z39.50
mailing lists.

Subject: Release .3b of The WWW Browser For Emacs

Hey folks,
  Its time to announce yet another release of my World Wide Web
browser for emacs.  This will be the last release for a while, as I am
contemplating a major rewrite as an independent project for school.
(Better image support, real parser, et al)
  
  The files can be gotten from:
file://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/w3.tar.Z  for the main files
file://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/extras.tar.Z for the support files
file://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/DOCS.[dvi|ps] for some documentation

  If you'd just like to check out the documentation, look at:
http://moose.cs.indiana.edu:80/elisp/w3/docs.html - it is the start of a
documentation tree for the browser.  I'm also working on a latexinfo
version of the documentation, but its slow going. :)

  As always, happy emacsing, and please send me a mail message if you pick
up the package.  Also, please mail any and all bug reports/fixes and URLS
that break my browser to wmperry@indiana.edu - I'll try to get back to you
as soon as possible.

Thanks,
   Bill P.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I'm calling this .3b - here is a list of the major changes from the last
public release (.1?b or some such):

Mon May  3 08:16:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Can now print the url under point - no key binding yet.
* Added the ability to store a gopher link into the hotlist - thanks
  to scott snyder <snyder@fnald0.fnal.gov> for patching gopher-mode to
  support this.  No key binding yet.
* Added the 'links' menu back into lucid emacs.

Fri Apr 30 11:56:57 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed a problem with viewing local files with w3-viewer-alist

Thu Apr 29 11:43:13 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-fetch now defaults to the url of the current document if the
  document you invoke it from is in w3-mode.
* Added ability to find links of just #link - doesn't need to reload
  the whole document.
* Applied several patches fro Alastair Burt (burt@dfki.uni-kl.de)
  * Better updating of menu bar in Lucid
  * Updates the interal w3-hotlist when you delete a hotlist entry
  * Problem with the w3-viewer-alist - it tried to play
    Something.Thesaurus
* Fixed problems with w3-graphics-converter-alist, and lots of
  problems with the w3-hypertext-extns.
* Fixed problem with finding files for dired-mode - would still try to
  do the viewing, etc.

Wed Apr 28 07:23:56 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed problem with dired-ing remote ftp files.  Removed lots of
  useless if file-directory-p [...], and just did a find-file - let
  ange-ftp and dired take care of it - they know how better.
* Fixed problem where w3-epoch-frob-resources would not set the
  defaults if no Xresources were specified - thanks to Luis Miguel
  Silveira (lms@rle-vlsi.mit.edu) for noticing it.
* Changed the w3-delimit-links variable so that you can specify
  'linkname as its value, and have the old style "Link text
  here[link#here]" style of showing links.  Nil shows nothing,
  non-nil, non-linkname shows [[ & ]] around link text.

Tue Apr 27 15:37:18 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed problem in gopher handling - if no port was specified, it
  would get completely confused.

Mon Apr 26 17:06:33 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.2b
* Fixed problem with putting remote dirs into dired-mode with a bad
  default-filename.  Thanks to Larry Masinter
  (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing, and for the fix.
* Added newest nntp.el to the extras tar file
* Fixed problem where w3-current-last-buffer was not set correctly
  when reading news.
* Added support for news: links - single articles as well as whole
  groups are supported.

Sun Apr 25 15:36:55 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed recursive make install bug - thanks to Larry Masinter
  (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing it.
* Fixed problem with no default gopher object type.  Thanks to Larry
  Masinter (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing it.
* Fixed problem with no default gopher port.
* Fixed the auto-documenter so that it would insert "M-x <funcname>"
  if no bindings were found in the keymap. Thanks to Larry Masinter
  (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing it.
* Fixed problem with w3-file not passing to a viewer correctly.

Thu Apr 22 13:22:53 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed the handling of URL#link finding . . . depends on which
  emacs you are using, due to the weirdness of zones, etc, in each.
* Split the files up again.  Figure with >2000 lines, it should be
  done. :)
* No longer need w3-links-list - store all relevant information in the
  data segment of a zone.  Changed every function to use this new
  structure.

Wed Apr 21 08:24:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added variables w3-use-html2latex, w3-html2latex-prog, and
  w3-html2latex-args.  If w3-use-html2latex is non-nil, then
  w3-html2latex-prog is called in a subprocess with the flags defined
  by w3-html2latex-args, with the html source as standard input.
  Default is to do my (bad) regular expression matching to convert.

Tue Apr 20 08:51:19 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Can now specify regular expressions as the car of
  w3-viewer-assoc-list 
* fixed problem where epoch would not defvar the styles - just moved
  them out of w3-epoch-frob-resources, and it works.  Weird.
* Fixed several bugs in the w3-convert-html-to-latex function - now
  handles addresses and &amp; correctly.
* Fixed yet another dumb bug in the insertion of <PLAINTEXT> in
  non-hypertext documents.
* Added w3-member, instead of builtin (or predefined) member, since
  some definitions don't use equal for comparison like they are
  supposed to.

	This reminds me of the IETF meeting (resaurant BOF) at
	which the official sign language sign for "Internet" was
	constructed.  It was based on the "I" sign  (little finger
	of main hand only up?) and included suggestions of "wire"
	(two little fingers meeting in the middle tip to tip
	in a straight line?) and "friend" (two little fingers
	linked). It was something like little fingers tip to tip
	rotated back and forth one against the other.
	I may have got this all wrong -- Cynthia you
	can correct me.  I don't know whether it made it to RFC
	status yet.
	
	As for WorldWideWeb,  it sounds like it matches similar
	criteria.  It is based on W (middle three fingers only
	up, palm away from you). I don't know what "3" is.
	(Three fingers together?)
	Maybe to distinguish "WorldWideWeb" from "W" it has to be
	be modified a bit -- perhaps the three fingers of one
	hand (W) meeting the three fingers of the other hand (3)
	reminicent of Internet, connection, wire.  If something
	suggesting "knowlegde" and/or sharing could be snuck in
	there then that would be all the better. Is the sign for
	"W" backwards (palm toward you) already taken?
	
	Cynthia: WWW is an information-sharing system for the
	Internet, in case you haven't come across it (which I hope
	you will, as I'd like to see all the Internet Drafts and RFCs
	available on it.)

	World-Wide Web Software Put Into Public Domain
	===============================================

A declaration that the basic World-Wide Web software from CERN is in  
the public domain has been signed by H. Weber, CERN's Director for  
Administration and W. Hoogland, Director for Computing.

The declaration, signed on 30 April 1993, makes it clear that this
is not a precedent for CERN software. It states, "CERN's intention
is to further compatibility, common practices, and standards in
networking and computer supported collaboration."

The declaration covers the "libwww" common code library, the line  
mode browser (www) and the W3 server (httpd).

The World-Wide Web (W3) is a global information system with a
easy point-and click interface. It provides access to almost all
existing Internet-based information as well as a whole new world
of data presented to the user as multimedia hypertext.  By a sequence  
of hypertext jumps and text searches, anyone can find his way though  
the mass of information available all over the world.

The High Energy Physics community, of which CERN is a European  
center, already uses W3 extensively.  In all there are more than 70
servers around the world providing data using special W3 protocols,
including such diverse areas as hypertext of US law from the Legal  
Information Institute at Cornell University, to the "Thesaurus  
Linguarum Hiberniae" collection of medaeval Irish manuscripts from  
University College, Cork.

Software for making servers is part of that put into the public  
domain by CERN. The other part is the "client" software which allows
the reader to move seamlessly through this data and also all the  
existing data on servers using existing "FTP", "WAIS", "Gopher", and
network news protocols. There are more than 14 different client  
programs for different computing platforms, written by people from
institues in many countries.  "The existence of a common, public  
domain kernel of software to handle the protocols will ensure
compatibility, and prevent people having to 'reinvent the wheel'",
says CERN's Tim Berners-Lee, W3's creator.

The W3 project is a success story of international collaboration.
The National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) in
Illinois have been a powerful force, producing a popular "Mosaic"
client for workstations, and other contributions have come from many
other universities throughout the world.  In the US, the Web is seen  
as an answer to the Clinton administration's call for a National  
Information Infrastructure. It is growing fast. "Traffic we see on  
our CERN server has more than doubled every four months for the last  
two years", says Berners-Lee, "and of course there is a new server  
every few days".

"With the Web, we are sharing knowledge," says Berners-Lee, "without
discrimination as to who or where in the world you are."  The W3
developers look forward to a time when the Internet, and so the Web,  
will be accessible from homes and high schools anywhere.  As well as  
an opening up of research centers and government, they are looking  
for a sharing of ideas and educational material for all tastes and  
ages.

Ends.

title of the article is "Adventures in Hypertext: Creating an electronic  
hypertext library."  I'd like to find one or two people who would proofread the  
paper for technical accuracy.  Contact me via e-mail if interested.  Thanks.

This is a rather informal announcement of a rather informal web-server,
located at http://www.acns.nwu.edu/

I'm running the NCSA .3(beta) release of httpd, and have gotten the feeling
that non-Mosaic products don't get along all that well with it, but that's
one reason why I'm announcing -- to find out how true that is.  But I use
XMosaic, and have some inlined images and stuff -- that's really the
platform I'm creating for.

Of course, the real reason I'm announcing is that I want people to come
over and visit and tell me what they think!  Like I said, very informal,
but I could use some feedback about how things work and look...

Currently, we have:
* a sprouting collection of Jazz information grepped from
	rec.music.bluenote
* the SURFPUNK Technical Journal archives
* the space where the BLINK electronic journal archives will be  (our first
	issue goes out next week)

I'm also talking to Pete Ashdown, author of the XDZebra Techno Music
reviews about hypertexting and presenting his back-issues and future
stuff...  And, if anyone else has stuff they've been wanting to see
archived, and I find it interesting enough to stare at for hours of
hypertexting, we might make something of it...

Most of the files aren't very hyper-text-y yet, but as I find time and get
ideas, I'll work on it -- if any of you see ideas for good links or other
structural things, I'd appreciate word...

Thanks,
	Joe Germuska

Subject: The gateway to Whois servers
Reply-To: murphy@scotty.dccs.upenn.edu


I have a question about the gateway to whois, the items in this gopher
menu: gopher.tc.umn.edu 70 1/Phone Books/WHOIS Searches

The question is: Does the use of this gateway really have to _double_
the usage of a Whois server?  I've noticed that for many months now,
the SAME EXACT query would come into the Penn whois server within
seconds of each other, but from two different hosts.

Between approximately 11:44 AM and 12:54 PM (a little over an hour)
today, the log shows these lines (as well as a bunch of others which
were all from on-campus hosts, so I've omitted them):

Using Whois servers in this fashion is quite inefficient, and
irresponsible.  At the moment, whois queries are not terribly
expensive for us, but if they were, the gateway usage of this machine
would be crushing our server.  Please explain why the gateway behaves
so strangely, and what plans there are to fix this problem.

----- Begin Included Message -----
	
	As for WorldWideWeb,  it sounds like it matches similar
	criteria.  It is based on W (middle three fingers only
	up, palm away from you). I don't know what "3" is.
	(Three fingers together?)
	Maybe to distinguish "WorldWideWeb" from "W" it has to be
	be modified a bit -- perhaps the three fingers of one
	hand (W) meeting the three fingers of the other hand (3)
	reminicent of Internet, connection, wire.  If something
	suggesting "knowlegde" and/or sharing could be snuck in
	there then that would be all the better. Is the sign for
	"W" backwards (palm toward you) already taken?
	
----- End Included Message -----

How about this:

- You hold your middle three fingers ("W" and "3") out with palm facing
  down (information source).

- Another person holds middle three fingers out with palm facing up
  (information need).

- Both people meet and interlace the fingers ("web").

- Each person holds their other hand out similarly, but with the palm facing
  in the opposite direction

- Seek out other people with which to randomly interconnect.

- Repeat until it's world-wide. :-)

Ok, after a day's search, I give up:

where can I find WAISGate.c and ParseWSRC.c mentioned in the
CommonMakefile of the 2.05 daemon distribution?

(I found //info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Implementation/WAISGate.c,
but am not sure if this is the right version, and where is the
ParseWSRC bit, anyway?)

Thanks!

This one is a bit more practical than the astronaut.  It puts up a little
book icon at the bottom of the page and you can use it to select UP,
FORWARD, or BACK in the text.  To be fully functional (so it knows were
you clicked on the icon) you need the xmosaic-1.0-image-hack patches
available from the demo page.

I'm thinking about how to do auto-indexing because there is no point in
doing this by hand (esp with my weird syntax for this).  It'll probably
be database driven with an HTML+ interperter in the server that takes
something like
>>>INDEX_ME<<<
in the document and sticks the index info there.  Any thoughts?  My
next project towards this goal is file type mapping in &send_file;
so it'll take foo.xxx and run it through a specified filter that
converts it to html (for dumping databases, doing interpreted menus,
and on the fly indexing).

The demo is at:

http://www.bsdi.com/demo/bookmark/index.html

The code is http://www.bsdi.com/server/bookmark.pl
The image data is http://www.bsdi.com/images/bookmark/

I haven't documented this in the server docs yet.  I will before 1.1.

Enjoy!

Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.36.1.1]

I am drafting an extended verion of the HTML standard and would
like to know if anyone is using the <BLOCKQUOTE> element for quoted
paragraphs. This element has a name greater than 8 characters
which could cause problems with some SGML parsers.

Would anyone object if we changed the tag name to "QUOTE" ?

Cheers,

Dave Raggett

 I grabbed this on the wais-talk mailing list. See at end : "Research  
Workshop on Information Access and the Networks", to be held after  
the conference, on July 1st. Someone should go there to represent  
World-Wide Web. Reply quickly: statements of interest are due May 15!

               PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS
                 Sunday, June 27, 1993

       SIGIR tutorials provide an opportunity to learn the basics
of IR or to learn about a new or specialized area from experts in
the field.  This year, six half-day tutorials are available prior
to the main program, held in parallel sessions during the morning
and afternoon.  Separate registration is required for tutorials.


             Morning Tutorials: 8:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.

               Introduction to Information Retrieval

            Keith van Rijsbergen, University of Glasgow

       This tutorial will enable participants to reach an
understanding of the science and engineering underlying
information retrieval research and development.  It is aimed at
anyone who wants to:
(a)    do research in IR but has little or no basic knowledge in
       the subject;
(b)    examine the state of research and development in IR for
       commercial purposes;
(c)    teach IR at advanced undergraduate or postgraduate level but
       has no prior knowledge;
(d)    think about IR but has rarely thought about it before and
       does not know where to start.
The tutorial will answer the following questions:
(a)    What is IR?
(b)    What are sensible models for IR?
(c)    How to measure things in IR.

       Keith van Rijsbergen was born in Holland in 1943.  He was
educated in Holland, Indonesia, Namibia and Australia. He took a
degree in mathematics at the University of Western Australia. As
a graduate he spent two years tutoring in mathematics while
studying computer science. In 1972 he completed a Ph.D. in
computer science at Cambridge University. After almost three
years of lecturing in information retrieval and artificial
intelligence at Monash University he returned to the Cambridge
Computer Laboratory to hold a Royal Society Information Research
Fellowship. In 1980 he was appointed to the chair of computer
science at University College Dublin; from there he moved in 1986
to the Glasgow University where he is now, and indeed is head of
department.

       Since about 1969 his research has been devoted to
information retrieval, covering both theoretical and experimental
aspects. He has specified several theoretical models for IR and
seen some of them from the specification and prototype stage
through to production. His current research is concerned with the
design of appropriate logics to model the flow of information. He
is also involved in several Esprit projects concentrating on the
engineering issues associated with the building of IR systems. He
is a fellow of the IEE and a member of the BCS. In 1993 he was
appointed Editor-in-Chief of The Computer Journal. He has also
recently been appointed a member of the Advisory Committee for

    Developing Information Retrieval Applications using Object    

                       Database Technology

              David J. Harper, University of Glasgow

       The field of information retrieval (IR) has yielded a range
of techniques for efficiently and effectively storing and
retrieving information items based on their text content.  The
utility of many application systems could be greatly enhanced by
employing these techniques. Examples of such applications include
office information systems, hypertext systems, and advanced
information systems for government and industry.  In this
tutorial we describe how modern IR techniques, namely automatic
indexing and best-match retrieval, can be efficiently implemented
and conveniently delivered to application developers 

using object-oriented design and object database technology.  We
examine some sample applications and thereby demonstrate that the
resultant IR framework, which takes the form of a class library,
is both useable and extensible by application developers.  We
argue that our approach has a number of advantages over
traditional mechanisms of delivery such as standalone packages
and conventional programming language libraries.  The tutorial
is aimed at software designers and engineers who want to employ
modern IR techniques within application systems, academics and
researchers who are interested in implementing, experimenting
with or prototyping IR systems, and managers wanting to assess
the benefits of implementing IR applications using object
database technology.  Basic knowledge of IR and database concepts
is assumed.  A brief introduction to object-oriented concepts and
object database technology will be provided.

       David J. Harper is a lecturer in the Department of Computing
Science, University of Glasgow, Scotland.  He is a principal
investigator in Glasgow on the EEC-funded ESPRIT project
Comandos, which is concerned with the construction and management
of distributed open systems, and he leads a major research stream
on object data management services. His other research interests
include information retrieval systems, object-oriented design and
programming, formal specification of database systems, and office
information systems.  

He received his B.Sc.(Hons) in Computer Science from Monash
University, Australia, in 1973 and his Ph.D. in Computing Science
from the University of Cambridge, England, in 1980.

              Trends in Multimedia Development

           Alan Griffiths, University of Sheffield


       New products and applications for multimedia are being
announced almost daily and there is a considerable hype over what
is still a commercially insecure field with ill-defined standards
and user groups.  This tutorial will provide a stimulating
overview of multimedia and will discuss a wide range of examples
including computer-assisted-learning (CAL), image banks,
electronic books and virtual reality. The currently available
multimedia products and services will be examined to look for
trends in development and these will be extrapolated into the
future to propose products and services which will take advantage
of the hardware, software and intellect combinations to create
imaginative learning and information environments. This
enthusiastic view will be tempered by discussing the very real,
and unresolved, problems in designing large multimedia systems.
The aims of the
tutorial are:
(a)    To provide an overview of current and future trends in
       multimedia;
(b)    To provide thought-provoking possibilities for information
       products incorporating multimedia;
(c)    To stimulate discussion on how information retrieval
       techniques can and are being implemented into multimedia
       products.

       The attendees for this tutorial will be people interested in
the stimulating prospects that multimedia offers, but not
necessarily specialists in the field. Multimedia will not provide
a solution to information retrieval but it can provide front-end
systems which use the algorithms and techniques outlined
elsewhere in the conference.

       Alan Griffiths is an independent consultant working in the
areas of database and multimedia design, and is also a part-time
lecturer in multimedia at the Department of Information Studies,
University of Sheffield, England. Over the past ten years he has
completed consultancies for a diverse group of clients ranging
from heavy industry to public sector organizations. These clients
have included Birmingham City Council, the Council for British
Archaeology, Hewlett Packard, various parts of the British
government, Basil Blackwells, Bridon Ropes and the Health &
Safety Executive. His hazardous chemical software, produced for
the Health & Safety Executive, is marketed by HMSO and used
world-wide. His presentations on multimedia have been given to
academic groups, software houses, companies and the public in
England, France, Italy, Canada and Mexico.


            Afternoon Tutorials: 1:30 - 5:30 p.m.

        Natural Language Processing for Information Retrieval

     David Lewis and Elizabeth Liddy, AT&T Bell Laboratories and
                      Syracuse University

     Our subject is the application of natural language
processing (NLP) methods to information retrieval (IR) systems. 

We will discuss the characteristics of human language that make
IR difficult, and will provide an extensive treatment of both NLP
methods and their non-NLP alternatives for addressing these
characteristics.  We will also discuss the newer area of using IR
components to aid NLP systems.  This tutorial should be of
interest both to researchers interested in past work and current
research directions, and to application developers and managers
who need to choose practical strategies for immediate
implementation.  Linguistic examples will be drawn primarily from
English and Japanese, with a scattering from other languages.  A
bibliography on NLP and IR will be distributed.

       David D. Lewis (lewis@research.att.com) is a Member of
Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ,
where his research areas are IR, NLP, machine learning, and their
intersections.  Lewis has implemented a variety of experimental
and operational IR and NLP systems, as well as being an organizer
for several large scale evaluations of such software.

       Elizabeth D. Liddy (liddy@suvm.syr.edu) is an assistant
professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse
University, where her research areas are discourse linguistics,
semantic disambiguation, and the use of natural language
processing in information systems.  She is a co-principal
investigator on the DR-LINK project funded under the DARPA
Tipster initiative on text retrieval and filtering.


            Information Retrieval and Databases

       Norbert Fuhr, University of Dortmund, Germany

       Besides basic database functions such as concurrency,
recovery, security and integrity, future IR systems will also
need data modelling concepts for coping with structured documents
and powerful query languages in order to ask for any kind of
object in the database (for example authors, affiliations,
journals). On the other hand, database systems are required to
handle textual attributes and to provide appropriate text
retrieval facilities. This tutorial will present specific
database concepts which are important for both types
of systems.

       After a short introduction to basic database concepts, three
major lines of research will be considered:  modelling data
structure (relational and  NF2 models); modelling  structure  and 

behavior (object-oriented databases); and modelling uncertainty
(Fuzzy, Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer approaches).  For each of
these approaches, examples for their application to IR problems
will be presented.

       The target audience is those who have basic knowledge in IR
and now want to learn about the database aspects of the field.
The course would be most useful for people designing or building
IR or database systems.

       Norbert Fuhr is professor in the computer science department
of the University of Dortmund, Germany.  He holds a diploma and
doctorate in Computer Science from the Technical University of
Darmstadt.  He is well-known for his theoretical and experimental
work on probabilistic IR models.  Recently, his research
interests have focused
on the application of IR methods to factual databases and the
integration of IR and database systems.


        Non-Textual Compression in Full-Text IR Systems
          

           Shmuel T. Klein, Bar-Ilan University, Israel

       Data compression has received increased attention lately,
resulting in a large number of recent publications in this area.
The tutorial presents an overview of these recent developments.
We shall first classify the various types of files that appear in
a full-text
retrieval system. The focus will be on the auxiliary structured
files, such as dictionaries, concordances and various forms of
bitmaps, (which may significantly enhance the retrieval
algorithms) and will present state of the art approaches for
compressing them. The tutorial
is intended for researchers, designers and users of large textual
IR systems. By the end of the tutorial, the participant should be
able, for a given file, to choose the appropriate compression
technique and design his/her own encoding and decoding routines.

       Shmuel T. Klein received his Ph.D. from the Weizmann
Institute of Science in Israel. He then spent three years at the
University of Chicago and is now at Bar-Ilan University in
Israel. Dr. Klein has worked on two of the world's largest
natural language full-text information retrieval systems: the
Responsa Project at Bar-Ilan University (in Hebrew),
and the Tresor de la Langue Francaise at the University of
Chicago (in French), and has published several papers on various
aspects of compression in IR systems.

                 INFORMATION ACCESS AND THE NETWORKS
              A Research Workshop (held after SIGIR'93)
                  July 1, 1993  ---  Pittsburgh, PA

Information access involving networks is one of the most important
growth areas in the broad field of information technology.  User
demand has caused a massive growth in the size of the Internet and  
the
amount of information accessible on it.  This has made it imperative
to develop new technologies to provide an infrastructure for this new
information space.  This workshop will bring together researchers and
developers to discuss network-based information services in both
general and specific terms, drawing upon those attending ACM SIGIR  
'93
and the communities related to:
        * Archie
        * Digital Libraries
        * Gopher
        * HyperPage
        * Knowbots
        * NCSA Mosaic
        * NNTP/Usenet
        * Prospero
        * Veronica
        * WAIS
        * WWW (WorldWideWeb)
        * Z39.50
along with other related initiatives, protocols, systems, and  
services.

Attendees will include persons with an active interest in
network-based information systems and relevant research.

Presentations will include design and implementation of
client-server architectures, resource discovery, distributed file
systems and services, development of integrated network tools, and  
innovative 

applications of more basic technologies, such as bulletin board  
systems and 

electronic mail.

The workshop format involves a plenary session from 8:30-11:30 a.m.
with invited speakers, each of them addressing a major theme in the
area of wide-area networking. After some discussion, the workshop  
will
break up into groups, starting with a working lunch.  The  
organization
of these groups and assignment of participants to them will be based
on a short interest statement provided by each participant.

The workshop will conclude with brief summary presentations by
group leaders.  Notes from the plenary talks and interest
statements will be provided to attendees and made available
for online access after the workshop.

In addition to discussion of the initiatives, protocols, systems, and
services listed above, other topics of interest include:
         * scaling - to handle more users, more databases or  
documents,
                 bigger databases, larger data items (e.g.,  
multimedia)
         * efficiency - algorithms, data structures,
                simulations, experiments
         * effectiveness - evaluation methods, studies, designs
         * interfaces - platforms, user needs, development methods,
                 evaluations, integration with other applications
         * limitations and future plans for enhancement
         * progress in developing standards or using existing ones
         * technical details relating to protocols, implementations
         * user studies, application surveys, innovative uses
         * integration - plans, designs, requirements,  
implementations
                 of systems to integrate information access over
                 the networks
         * novel applications using network-enabled information  
access
                 technology.

Rob,

I was hoping you could give me the benefit of the views of O'Reilly and
Associates on some features that we could put into the extended standard for
HTML. In particular, I would like some input on how much information is
needed to specify tables.

It seems to me that tables can be characterised as follows:

    o   tables consist of headers, rows and columns

    o   tables often have dividing lines (single and double lines)

    o   alignment of cell data, e.g. left, right, on decimal point, ...

    o   tables can be nested (breaking a cell up into a nested table)

How important do you guys think it is to give the author detailed control
over things like dividing lines and cell alignment?

I would be very interested if you have any thoughts as to how HTML should
handle tables and the level of detail to aim for. We want to keep HTML
reasonably simple while hitting most peoples needs. As experienced publishers
of technical material where do you think we should take HTML?

Many thanks,

Dave Raggett

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]

readers:

chapter 6 of the march 15, 1993 version of "Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML)" by Berners-Lee and Connolly discusses "Link Relationship values."

i have several questions about this chapter:

first, what is its status? are there browsers in use that recognize
these link attribute values? have any of these attributes been promoted
to be part of the standard?  are they likely to become part of the
standard? if so, when and under what authority?

second, if browsers ignore attribute values that they do not recognize, why
must these "experimental" values be preceded with "X-".

third, are there any example documents showing the use of these values?

fouth, is the value "Made" correctly described in this chapter?
the chapter says that Made means that the:

   Person (etc) described by node A is author of, or is responsible for B

where A is the source document and B is the destination document. however, 
the chapter also says that one use for the value is "for sending
mail to authors," and it seems to me that Made would be more useful if
A and B were reversed in the definition above.
that is, it seems more useful for a document to contain a pointer to a file
describing an author where the link relationship would be "Made" with
the understanding that the person described in B is the author of A.
can someone clarify this (what seems to me to be a) discrepancy?

fifth, since we are looking for a way to connect html documents with
their authors or responsible authorities, the value Made appears to be
a possible approach.  but, i would be interested in knowing any other
conventions for recording such information that may be planned or under
discussion.  i would actually prefer (at least intuitively) to have
a tag defined for the document <head> section that could be used to
record responsibility for the document.  for example, <owner> could
be defined and have name, organization, and e-mail address as attributes.
our browser could then pick up the owner e-mail address for posting
comments from users reading a particular file directly to the owner.
in particular, we might have the following tag 
     <owner name="Michael Grobe" e-mail="grobe@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu">
comments?

Disclaimer: This posting represents the poster's views, not those of IBM
News-Software: UReply 3.1

It's clear from these postings that the WWW system is pretty
sophisticated and has many of the functional attributes one would
expect in a HyTime-based system, including sophisticated query links,
various addressing methods, and so on.  I would urge the the WWW folks
to consider recasting the WWW in HyTime terms.  By using HyTime
constructs to define hyperlinks and other WWW functions, the WWW
system would become compatible with all other HyTime-conforming
systems.  It would, for example, make the WWW able to manage
hyperlinks to and from document in any DTD that used HyTime-compliant
hyperlink elements, meaning, for example, that both OSF-DOC and
IBMIDDoc documents could be integrated into a WWW system without
change to the documents themselves.  It's unlikely that I would add
support for WWW-specific link elements that were not HyTime compliant
to IBMIDDoc, but it is highly likely that I would add support for
WWW-specific addressing notations in IBMIDDoc implementations if WWW
used HyTime for hyperlinks.

This functionality was suggested by a colleague; it sounds good to me.

We would like to publish our prospectus in HTML. At the back of the
printed copies of the prospectus, ther are details of how to contact
Cranfield by post or email for further information on particular courses.

In the HTML version, it would be nice to have a URL like

<a HREF="mailto:course-info@cranfield.ac.uk/Name: \nAddress: \nCourse:
\nref: \n">Send an enquiry</a>

This would have the effect that when the anchor is activated, clients
display a window (initialised with the optional text following the "/".

This is not the first time a mail address has been suggested as a URL
and I think it is so useful that it should go in.

It IS the first time that mail header fields have been suggested as  
part of the URL.  I am not so sure about that one -- it would have to
be well defined.

I like the idea of the mail address, as I can see a sophisticated  
browser not just opening a mail send window, but representing the
mail endpoint with for example a list of mail messages which the guy  
has written.  Creating a link between
a document and the "person" would mail the document to the person,
just as creating a link between a document and a newsgroup would
post the document, etc..

In this case the additional fields in the URL would rather confuse
things, as they wouldn't in fact define a more specific mail  
location, they would be more of a template or a script.  I would
prefer to see that sort of thing handled properly with forms in HMML.

What to you URI folks think of this? The simplest form is
to specify

	mailto:user@host

where the LHS is a regular Internet mail address.

* This would nicely integrate mail address servers, as a form for  
returning mail address info

* The To: and From: fields of messages would be treatable
as hypertext links, just as the Newsgroup: and Reference: fields
are now.

* A link type <LINK REL="AUTHOR" HREF="bloggs@acme.com"> would be
 a formal way of attributing responsability.
 

* etc etc

I think this would be pretty neat, really useful, not too much sweat.
What do you think?

This functionality was suggested by a colleague; it sounds good to  
me.

We would like to publish our prospectus in HTML. At the back of the
printed copies of the prospectus, ther are details of how to contact
Cranfield by post or email for further information on particular  
courses.

In the HTML version, it would be nice to have a URL like

<a HREF="mailto:course-info@cranfield.ac.uk/Name: \nAddress:  
\nCourse:
\nref: \n">Send an enquiry</a>

This would have the effect that when the anchor is activated, clients
display a window (initialised with the optional text following the  
"/".
When finished, the user confirms the contents, and the client sends a
mail message to the address shown.

Subject: Automatic reply in HTML

Peter:

I've already implemented something akin to your mailto: URL in Cello,
though not as detailed.  My method may be slightly more in line with
URL syntax (or it may not, who knows) and looks like:

       mailto://some.mail.host.dom/somebody

The behavior is for a mail form to pop up with the user's
(preconfigured in the MS-Windows equivalent of a .rc file) e-mail
address as sender, and with somebody@some.mail.host.dom as the
recipient.  I thought it unnecessarily complicated to try to specify
the content of the message beyond this....

Incidentally, this works quite nicely with any kind of doc (such as
text returned from a CSO/qi server) which contains 'actionable' email
addresses, and provides a nice way to do staff directories and such.

Regards,
Tb.

That sounds very strange. That is not how it should work.  The
parser should clear the host field if "file:" is present. If the
field is clear, then local access it assumed.  The relative names
are hierarchical, not a matrix -- you can't pick up a hostname
from another protcol for example.

It sounds as though there is some difference in behaviour.  This will
go away when Mosaic picks up the new library.

Sounds as though they have used their own code for URL parsing.

There is of course one good reson for explicitly declaring the  
hostname for a local file: that is, in order that people on other
machines which don't have it don't get confused.  The URLs are
supposed to be quatable anywhere. If you use a hostname, then even
if the file is not retrievable from off that host, then at least
a foreign person following the link will get an reasonable error.
Th eidea of a URL is that if one perosn quotes it and the other  
person follows it, then they will be talking about the same object.
If one guy says "look in file /rtc/printcap on line 100"
and th eother guy does so, they get confused. The reference
doesn't work.

How about in your case, if you have a whole cluster or campus which
has the same file system, invent a name for it or use one master
hostname.  This would appear in all the absolute links.  The
rule file would then map it to a local name

map file://cluster.cmu.edu/* file:///*

This can be ina cluster-wide rule file.
I have put in the dummy name "localhost" (not case sensitive)
into the next release,
so this can be made more explicit.  It will be equivalent to an
empty host field.

Absolutely. I didn't intend the initial mail contents to be a "mail
header" far from it, I simply suggest that a way of filling in a form
as well as posting arbitrary mail is a definite requirement. If there
is (to be) a proper form spec, let's use that, though it will have to
clearly documented how a filled in form is to be translated to a text
mail message. Using MIME mail is NOT satisfactory, as the system should
work when the mail recipient is not MIME aware.

Subject: Re: Automatic reply in HTML


I agree the functionality is useful.  I am not sure that
a special purpose URL is desirable.  Perhaps a more
general approach is possible.  Consider that reply mail
contains aspects of general purpose form-filling queries
(which we've discussed, and which even Gopher has already)
and has also been implemented at least once by Nathaniel
Borenstein in AtomicMail (a Lisp-subset for making email
messages with programmable but safe side effects.  reply mail
was one of the key purposes of AtomicMail.  alas, it is proprietary
to Bellcore as I understand it, though he is working on a new
and better version which will be presented as an RFC.)

So though I have no specific syntactic proposal to make I
suggest reply mail might be either
 1) a special case of general programmatic invocation
 2) a special case of form-filling-queries

On the other hand I recognize the trend of late in WWW to
implement special purpose features in an adhoc manner without
trying to design the ultimate feature set; and this may even
be a good idea given our lack of experience in the matter.

They have not been promoted to part of the standard, but if they
are tested they could be.  RFCs don't become standards without
implementations.  No browsers that I know of implement them though
many people have expressed great enthusiasm.  The thing will go
in RFC direction, the authority will therefore be IANA and the IETF
or whatever officially is the authority in the nwo (IAB? ISoc?)

This scheme (which is used for many Internet standards) means
that ifyou invent a scheme which puts a certain semantics on
a new relationship, you can guarrantee that the scheme won't break
because someone just happens to use it for something else with
different semantics.  During the test phase, you can't be SURE
that noone else thought of the same X-relation, and that their
documents will totally confuse your software.  (though it is
unlikely especially with a this list running)

Nope (correct me?).  [[Historical note:  The first hypertext system I  
wrote used typed links.  An interesting result was
that though I had initially imagined that the number of link
types would grow without bound, in fact I settled down with a
dozen or so having all the semantics there seemed to be
beteween the things I was making notes about]].

Every link type can be used in a REL attribute or in a REV
attribute (or in some -- non acyclic -- cases conceivably both).
The REV attribute is just the same, but the direction is
reversed.  This saves having to have a convention for
naming reverse link types such as "made-by".

Whilest any useful additions to HTML for HMML are open to
discussion now, I would like to see more generic forms used.
This is because HTML is not an application-specific document
type, it is in fact a great big compromise which allows enough
fairly generic structures to represent most things anyone wants.
If "owner" can be represented as a generic relationship, between
a document and a person, with a particular type, then I would
prefer the generic form to be used rather than a specific tag  
invented.  I think this will make processing easier, also expansion,
and keep the DTD small.

<LINK REV=MADE HREF="whois:S=Grobe;G=Michael;O=Ukans">

Here is one example of something which is
easier to do is a web traversal filtered by relationships. Consider
"Give me a list of (and fire :-) all the people who have MADE  
software which is USED BY this program and for which there is no  
document which DESCRIBES that software"

Yes.  I guess we have to be a little more definite about the object
which is being located.  I prefer to see the web as something with
a state which one can alter, rather than a recipe book scripts behind  
the buttons.  The
"mailto:" URL suggests the well defined concept of a mailbox which
may or may not contain documents and may or may not have
restricted access. Perhaps "mailbox:" would be better than "mailto:".
Moving a document into somone's mail box is just like moving a
file into a directory: it is an operation with pre- and  
postconditions.  It just happens that mail uses a particular
protocol which is optimised for particular operations,
has a wide penetration, etc., but can otherwise be treated
with the same user interface metaphor as news and retrieval.

"telephoneto" like "telnet" doesn't fit into that model, and
so is less usefully integrated.

Is there not a subsyntax for the usermailbox@domain bit, with the
comment personal Name removed?  It would have the example of being
a little closer to something which one can test for equality.

Yes. I had intended to keep "=" in the URL spec
so that it could be used to map /attribute=value/ such as x400.
If you directly quote an RFC822 address, then you run across
the fact MIME uses = instead of %, and all kinds of things.
Would it be possible to remove all RFC822 quoting and apply
URL escaping as a reversable and well-defined transformation
which would presvent the horrible results of layered escaping?

I agree completely.  Tom's format was designed to look as like
as possible to http URLs, but there is in the
news:artic@leid a precedent for exactly the same reasons for
keeping the original as uncorrupted as possible.

The discussion about local files prompts me to ask - how does one
distinguish between ones own local ftp area (which is what the outside
world sees when following a file URL), and the local file system
mounted under root (which is what a client program like xmosaic sees)?.
How do I refer to my own ftp area?

As far as I can see, no URL should refer to different mechanisms in
different contexts. Lets have ftp: (use ftp ONLY) and file: (local file
system ONLY, further use discouraged). I don't want an afs: URL,
because it's equivalent to file: if you're an AFS site, and useless if
you aren't. OK, AFS sites (we are one) can mount each others file
systems, but it's NOT a preferred method of allowing the world access
to info that we want to make public.

I have been toying with a similar idea, how to keep track of documents
which you would like to have in a "hotlist," but are more numerous and
require more structure filing, e.g. like UNIX files in the filesystem.

What I have done is modify some code in gui2.c which allows local files
that are "opened" from the File "Open local..." menu item to be symbolic
links which point nowhere, but include the URL, e.g.

% ln -s http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/evl/cave/cave.html .

which creates the symbolic link cave.html.  The patch is quite simple
and is included.  There needs to be additional work done to allow the
user to specify the name on the command line, e.g.

% xmosaic cave.html

and have the additional test of a local symbolic link encoding a URL and
to the file browser to show such entries (it might be nice to even
identify such entries as URL's).

In addition, some consideration should be given for allowing a third
party, e.g. the LookingGlass software, to send a message to Mosaic
asking it to load a local file.

My $0.02.

Maybe.  I'm not sure how far the distinction is important, but you can't
externally specify delivery to my actual mailbox, nor can you determine
how many of those I have and how your message will be routed by filters
I impose on incoming mail.  All you get with a "mailbox name" is an
abstraction with which you can deliver something to my host's mail user
agent; after that, what happens to it is a local responsibility/issue
that is traditionally not subject to Internet protocols.

>"telephoneto" like "telnet" doesn't fit into that model, and
>so is less usefully integrated.
   Actually, if you are trying to deliver an audio entity, or have
text-to-speech capability, they are pretty similar in theory (the
practice is different because we tend to attach different tools to
mailboxes, but you can't predict this from the protocols).  Whether a
telephone number addresses an individual or a group can't be determined
in the general case.  Whether the message is recorded or discarded after
first reading/hearing is a local matter, as are a series of possible
forwarding and diversion operations.

>Is there not a subsyntax for the usermailbox@domain bit, with the
>comment personal Name removed?  

  First, just to clarify for those who aren't used to the syntax (or who
have seen it for years and not paid attention)...
     (this is a comment)   It is, from a protocol standpoint, noise that
can be discarded without loss of important information.
     The personal name ("phrase" in RFC822-speak) isn't a comment, it is
part of the address.  Mail systems have some obligation to preserve it
(a rule often broken) and not map it into a comment or vice versa
(thereby destroying or inventing information--also often broken).  In
environments at the periphery of the network, where mailboxes cost
money, personal names are often used to differentiate among users of the
same mailbox and post-delivery dispatching arranged on that basis.
    But, yes, one could eliminate the personal-name part as not machine-
addressable.  But there are still a number of variant forms.

>It would have the example of being
>a little closer to something which one can test for equality.
   Not much.   One of the intermittent interesting questions in email-
land is "how do I look down a list of addresses and eliminate
duplicates".  The general answer is "can't".  There are two problems,
both of which related to the mailbox-abstraction issues discussed above.
The first is that there are religious debates about whether
   Joe <someuser@somehost>     and
   Mary <someuser@somehost>    are the same
The machine-processable mailbox strings are the same, but "Joe" and
"Mary" tend to think they are different.

The second is that there is really nothing you can test for equality
anyway.  I've just done a quick count and probably forgotten a few, but
I've got at least eight addresses (different apparent mailboxes on
different apparent hosts) that cause mail to appear in the vicinity of
klensin@infoods.unu.edu, plus one that causes _most_ of the mail sent to
it to appear here, but which keeps the rest.  It takes far more
information than the mail system "owns" and will tell you to deduce the
relationships.

>Would it be possible to remove all RFC822 quoting and apply

  At the risk of being cynical, it depends on the standards of quality
to which you can hold implementors of URL systems and, to the degree to
which humans have to see or type these things, those people.  If the
quality is comparable to what we have experienced with email, it is
hopeless--the quoting conventions in RFC822 are not implemented
correctly by a painful number of systems (and they've had a decade to
get it right).

Presumably this is going to be specific to address formats of the
general form we all know and love, "smtp://cs.indiana.edu/mvanheyn"
seems to me the most consistent and unambiguous method for specifying
my mail address.  I think calling something "mail" or "mailto" is
rather unclear, since the number of different ways to specify mail
routing and the like is greater than one.  We already have silly
ambiguity with "file:" being both local file reference and FTP; let's
not do that again with mail.

On the contrary (as I argued before), rfc-822 mail addresses are
independent of routing!  E.g. at our site all outgoing mail from a
workstation is first moved onto the central mail server machine which
takes care of delivery using whatever method it sees fit.  In fact
most of our users won't even recognize "smtp" as the name of a mail
delivery protocol.

In general different sites may have different mechanisms to deliver
mail, but the same mail address works for all (ideally, anyway).

Also note that the "host" part of a mail address needn't be the name
of a real host -- it is just a mail domain.  The use of
"smtp://host/user" smells too much of direct delivery at a particular
host, while in fact the proper way to send mail is to hand it to a
local agent that knows what's right...

Regarding the issue of embedding email pointers within documents:

  I would like to see some sort of mechanism for including within an
email "form" information about the context from which the meesage was
sent.  For example, as the recipient of such a message, I might want
to know how/where it was generated.  Suppose the same pointer/tag was
embedded in multiple documents, I might want to know that a particular
message was sent from document A so I can go back and change the
reference if necessary/appropriate.  Or perhaps I'd like to know that
over 80% of such messages were being generated from document A and only
10% from document B; then I might be more inclined to spend time on
developing A than B.
  Which header field would be most appropriate to put this info?  News
uses the "Followup-To" header for an analogous purpose; it tells you
the context within which the message was generated.

#
# 	As for WorldWideWeb,  it sounds like it matches similar
# 	criteria.  It is based on W (middle three fingers only
# 	up, palm away from you). I don't know what "3" is.
# 	(Three fingers together?)
# 	Maybe to distinguish "WorldWideWeb" from "W" it has to be
# 	be modified a bit -- perhaps the three fingers of one
# 	hand (W) meeting the three fingers of the other hand (3)
# 	reminicent of Internet, connection, wire.  If something

In ASL, if you shake W's towards each other, you get "war".
( a push-pull sort of conflict sign, with W's for war. )
Accurate as the connotations might be, you might avoid that
for the official sign.

I suggest don't try to make cute puns a language unless you are FLUENT
in it -- or you may get more than you asked for.  Depending on exactly
how the internet sign was done, I could see more similarities to "pain"
than to "friend".  I think I would have modified it to be more like
"story" with "wire" handshapes.  Would have retained the initial "i"
handshape, which is nice.


I'm hearing, and I'm not fluent in signs, but I'll suggest the following anyway.

If you want a sign for WWW, a very easy one is also very natural, and
that is simply to sign W W W.  When a single letter, (particularly one
with a handshape like W) is repeated, you don't open and close your
hand three times to make the W's -- rather you lean the W forward and
down, fingers straight out almost horizontal, and kind of bounce
downward thrice, each time a little to the (right-handed) signer's
right from where the previous one bounced.  The third time down, you
hold it there a moment, and don't bounce it back up.  This
leaning-forward and boucing-to-the-signer's-right is readily understood
to mean repitition.

It would be like the sign for the number "22" or "33", except thrice,
and in ASL the number 3 uses the thumb, index, and middle fingers,
whereas the W uses the three middle fingers. 

It has the advantage that a deaf person who does not know your
secret code sign for WWW would still see "WWW", just as if you said
"WWW" to a hearing person who did not know what WWW means, but could
recognize it later, or plug it into context hearing "World Wide Web".
("World" uses "W" handshapes, and "Wide" can.  I don't know web. )

The only danger I can see with "WWW" is some similarity to "world war
2" or "world war 3".  The context of this proper noun is different
enough from that proper noun that it's probably not a problem.




The best signs come not down from above, bestowed graciously on the
deaf by a hearing authority, but rather trickle up from below, from the
actual communities and their living languages...  and there should
be some deaf communities somewhere on the net, but I'm ignorant where.

Hmmm... I'll agree that "smtp" is too specific and a bit ill thought
out.  However, I believe that "mail" or "mailto" or the like is too
general.  Something like "rfc822" could be a bit clearer, albeit
rather cryptic.  There has to be a better way.

(Most users I know wouldn't know "rfc822" any more than "smtp", I
acknowledge, but oh well.)

General comments...

smtp is not only cryptic but also not wholly appropriate -- one never
gets information *from* smtp the protocol, and the act of simply
firing off a mail message via the system mailer doesn't really have
anything to do with smtp anyway.

mailto is the most appropriate one I can think of -- mail should be
reserved for reading mailboxes, for if and when that becomes an issue.

It makes little sense to mangle the address into something like
mailto://ncsa.uiuc.edu/marca; what happens with nonstandard addresses
such as uunet!foobaz!bar@cs.utexas.edu or foobar%foobaz@glom.com or
some of the more cryptic addresses (e.g., gatewayed through Sprintmail
-- anyone seen one of those yet?  strange stuff...) that are starting
to pop up?  Sure, there can be mappings established, but why bother?

I finally picked a name for my server code: Plexus

Plexus Version 1.1.1.1 is available through http://www.bsdi.com/

I integrated the SpaceWalk and Bookmark demos in the source release and
did a lot of cleanup.  Note that the demos moved because of this (I'll
leave pointers to them in the old locations for a while), check out
the home page http://www.bsdi.com/ for pointers.

The documentation is in better shape also.  I've started to split it out
into many files.  I need to add the bookmark stuff, flesh out the internals
part and talk about writing new gateways.

In case you are new to this list I've included some basics about Plexus.

It's great for playing around with new server ideas because you can
prototype them quickly in perl and the server can load them each time they
are accessed so you don't have to restart the server a hundred times.
When you are happy with them you can load them at startup for better
performance.

Plexus Features
---------------

Plexus is an HTTP server writen in perl that includes the
following features:

    Date and Time Gateway
	Displays the date and time using 61 different timezone translations.

    Finger Gateway
	Finger people and print out relevant faces.

    Directory Browser
	Sorted, last modification stamp, file size, and directory indictor.
	Allows HTML headers and footers.  User can specify filters using
	search keyword.

    Fortune
	Print out a fortune from the fortune database.

    Calendar
	Prints out calendars by month and year, will also do whole years.

    Restricted Access Directories
	Restricte access by account number and IP address.

    Image Decoding Libaray
	Find objects in images using bitmasks.

    Directory Search
	Search directory trees using perl regular expressions.

    Bookmark
	Iconic UP, FORW, and BACK using image decoding library and menus
	embedded in the URL.

As a deaf person myself, I'm fluent in both ASL and English sign languages.
I had an interesting conversation with Tim Berners-Lee, Chris Weider, 
Mitra, Steven Foster and Naomi Courter.  We actually invented a new sign 
for "Internet" - just like what Tim mentioned earlier.   The sign has the 
combination as a "network", "friend" and "wire".

I've been thinking about WWW something similiar, but to "distribute
information worlwide on-line".  Perhaps we could get together again
at Amsterdam if anyone interested in sharing ideas to create a new sign 
for WWW.

I agree that we could avoid anything "war" or "cutesy".

Hmmm... I'm looking, and I don't see HTML tags for some simple markup
features like, for example, <CENTER> or <FLUSHRIGHT>

Now this may be because HTML is, as a subset of SGML, not supposed to be so
specific about formatting.  But to create aesthetically pleasing documents,
one needs a little more than flush-left/ragged right text!  It seems that
center and flush right (and maybe even justified) could all be interpreted
by any client to fit the appropriate display size, and it'd make for a
little variety in HTML docs as well...

Also, I'm sure it's there, but I haven't run into it -- is there a
canonical list of HTML tags?  That isn't the DTD but something more
friendly to look at?  

Thanks,
	Joe

On the contrary (as I argued before), rfc-822 mail addresses are
independent of routing!  E.g. at our site all outgoing mail from a
workstation is first moved onto the central mail server machine which
takes care of delivery using whatever method it sees fit.  In fact
most of our users won't even recognize "smtp" as the name of a mail
delivery protocol.

In general different sites may have different mechanisms to deliver
mail, but the same mail address works for all (ideally, anyway).

Also note thatthe "host" part of a mail address needn't be the name
of a real host -- it is just a mail domain.  The use of
"smtp://host/user" smells too much of direct delivery at a particular
host, while in fact the proper way to send mail is to hand it to a
local agent that knows what's right...

....which apparently caused some misunderstandings.  My point, which I
thought was clear, was that email addresses, including
Sprintmail/X.400 addresses, should be left alone and not arbitrarily
rearranged as part of a 'mailto' or 'smtp' URL.  That is,
marca@ncsa.uiuc.edu should be:

        mailto:marca@ncsa.uiuc.edu

and not:
        
        mailto://ncsa.uiuc.edu/marca

and a Sprintmail address like (just to make one up)
/PN=joe.blow/FOO=bar/BLAZ=blech/ARGH=urgh@sprint.com should be:

        mailto:/PN=joe.blow/FOO=bar/BLAZ=blech/ARGH=urgh@sprint.com

and not:

        mailto://sprint.com//PN=joe.blow/FOO=bar/BLAZ=blech/ARGH=urgh

or:

        mailto://sprint.com/ARGH=urgh/BLAZ=blech/FOO=bar/PN=joe.blow

or whatever.

Again, my point was: email addresses (including Sprintmail/X.400)
GOOD, rearranging email addresses BAD.

Hope that clears things up.

You are dead right, HTML is not supposed to be specific
about formatting.  If we started with justification, where would
it end?  (Actually, we started with <I> for italic, but there
it ended.) 

Notice that even the line mode browser centers H1 headings
and right justifies ADDRESS sections for example.
I think that Mosaic for X doesn't because the text widget
used doesn't have any justification or tabbing.  
There is no reason why a browser should not have the
justufication style user-defined for each element.
Cello allows you to tailor a lot of things, maybe that,
(checks.) Not on my preprealpha version.

There have been a lot of advantges in sticking to the
logical markup rule.  It has allowed lots of browsers
to be creative and flexible in presentation, and
has allowed for example TeX to be generated intelligently
from a set of HTML documents.  If explicit markup had been
there, it would not have been possible.

The ADDRESS tag is used for formatting things in an addres-like
way.  people use it for all kinds of stuff email and paper mail
addresses, etc etc.  It is a visible thing, not a hidden link.

There are many more uses of the mailto: URL.

I agree that HTML should not be specific about formatting. But it
would be good if there were better guidelines about how browsers
should implement formatting instructions. This is because writers of
hypertext make some assumptions about how will their text be
presented. For example, when should carriage returns be inserted into
text? Many writers assume that CR is inserted automatically before
each header line, and do not put it in there explicitly. Now, someone
else might want to make a list item appear in the header style, like
this: 
 <LI><H1> This item should attract attention </H1>

The formatter that inserted CR before each header would add an
unintended CR when header starts, and line would come out like this:

 o
This item should attract attention

instead of like this:

 o This item shoud attract attention

To correct this problem, the parser could either not insert CR before
the header, or use a rule of thumb like "do not insert CR before
header when you are in the line item".

I am thinking about adding such rules to my parser. But then whoever
edits documents and uses my parser to look at them, and then sees
their text displayed differently on another parser, will complain.

If there are no guidelines, the writers might just settle down for the
simplest formatting. I would prefer some kind of standard, so that
people who desire some variety in their text could get it.

Although it's not quite polished enough to share, the Digital Media Group
within O'Reilly and Assoc. is working on a proposal and library to support
stylistic hints or suggestions which can be available to a browser which
would like to attempt to render a document as close as possible to the
publisher's original intent.

I just thought I would mention that there is some hope on the horizon. 
Fear not!  I'll try to polish what we have up quickly so that we can get
the community involved.  </rr>

Mosaic (i.e. the HTML widget) had centering at one point, but it
wasn't used because we thought headers looked better without.  At some
point we'll do full style sheets, and have it as an option...

(However, that does raise the question of what it means to have
headers embedded in other elements, and if that's even allowable, as
has been bandied about here in the past.)

Please don't set up a bi-directional gateway.  Just forward this list to
the newsgroup.  Having to discard umpteen messages from various gawkers
at different educational sites is one of the fastest ways to kill an
interesting list.  Having to send to the mailing list (and having to
find out what the mailing list is) provides a small but useful filter on
input noise.

Rather than add things like <CENTER> and <FLUSH-RIGHT> to the HTML
document, it seems that this sort of thing should be decided by the user
in their browser.  That is, probably most text should be filled and both
right and left justified by default, unless the user specifies
otherwise.  The user should be able to specify things like this for
different region-types of all documents, not for specific regions of
specific documents.

As things stand, the hypertext is not compatible with WWW but, as soon

that uses a compatible hypertext mechanism.  However, I don't see how
I could make it compatible with existing previewers: the features
offered by (La-)TeX are significantly greater, as far as I can tell,
than those available in any existing WWW viewer.

I have added some "Typical rendering" instructions to the
descriptions of headings, lists, P, ADDRESS, etc., in the HTML
description linked to
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html
which might help.

Absolutely.  Those conversant with SGML realise that the H1 means
"this is a heading, do everything which is appropriate"
which implies paragraph break, maybe a new page if H1 is printed on  
paper, a big font, numbering maybe (not on the screen, please, but  
perhaps on paper), centering maybe, and lots of luverly white
space all over to make it stand out and easyto read, and an entry in  
a table of contents anyone might be generating, plus extra weighting  
of all the heading words in any full text index anyone might be  
generating. Much more than a font change, folks.

Aaagh.  Look at the DTD:  Not allowed.  Why? because it doesn't
make sense.  The heading isn't a style, its a heading.  Putting an H1
in a list is like putting an engine on a fruit tree.

The elements H1..H6, ADDRESS, UL, DL, BLOCKQUOTE imply paragraph  
break and a special paragraph style.  Do not confuse these with the
character highlighting elements, listed separately, such as EM, (and  
A) which do NOT cause a beak or define paragraph style.

Ok, could you look at what there is and tell me where it is  
inadequate? Thanks

This sounds very interesting. Not least, because we have a lot of TeX
and a lot of math.  Does the previewer operate on TeX files directly,
or does it need precompiling to dvi?

Obvioulsy one can convert HTML to TeX but not back.  The most  
important thing for you to stick to is the W3 addressing (URL)
syntax for the links.  This will allow your TeX documents to
be part of the web, wherever they are.

WWW servers have the possibility of providing alternative
representations depending on the capabilities of the client.
It might be interesting to look at automatic conversion of
HyperLaTex documents to HTML, with aplogies inserted
in place of equations, so that one an have universal readership
of a document with HTML, with those who can display the TeX
using that.

This sounds like extensions to TeX!  I assume you point to or
embedd foreign objects like JPEG etc. Correct?

O-Oh... security problems?  Same applies, but for JPEG read
scipt?

Certainly the author has more control over format, and can achieve
many more things.  The reader loses control over the format, unless
he can tweak standardized TeX macros which are used by the document.

Will you be able to produce a wysiwyg editor?

Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.25]

In <9305111102.AA02689@www3.cern.ch> Tim discusses email & URLs:

Tim's suggested format for email URL:

>        mailto:user@host

Seems fine to me, except I would prefer the prefix "email:", as in

        <A TITLE="add www-announce" HREF="email:listserv@info.cern.ch">

I too am doubtful about including the mail headers as part of the URL,
but note that the optional TITLE attribute for anchors can be used to
specify a title field. Clicking this link would bring up a mail-window
(e.g. "xterm elm listserv@info.cern.ch") so that the user can then
type the body of the message and modify the headers.

Peter Lister's suggestion for the equivalent of a "paper reply-paid card"
with boxes to be filled out by the customer, would be a good fit for a
form, invoked by clicking the link. In this case the form would be specified
as a separate document, which when completed is mailed rather than being
sent back to the server.

Good idea.

This is not at neat - the parser needs to know that REL="AUTHOR" implies
that the HREF is an email address. It would be more straightforward to
stick to the previous format and require the presence of the "email:" prefix.

        <LINK REL="AUTHOR" HREF="email:bloggs@acme.com">

Jim Davis comments:

Jim, there is no need to implement special purpose features for this. We will
be able to handle forms in a general way with HMML and the new HTRQ and HTTP
protocols. The addition of "email:" (or mailto) to the URL format is
a logical extension.

Cheers,

Dave Raggett

n.b. Jim, I am currently drafting a proposed standard for HMML (aka HTML+)
     and will distribute the results real soon now. Send your input to
     me c/o www-talk discussion group.

Good news!  I've convinced my news admin to set up the gateway.  What I'd
like to do now is have a fast informal vote on various possibilities.
Please vote on only one proposal.

Proposal 1.
  No gateway, let the mailing list die.
  Vote here if you are planning on reading the newsgroup and unsubscribing
  from the mailing list.  Note that there will be at least a one-direction
  gateway; I just wonder how may people won't care if it is there.

Proposal 2.
  Bi-directional gateway.
  Vote here if you have no USENET access whatsoever and want to use the
  mailing list as an interface to the newsgroup

Proposal 3.
  One-directional gateway. (from mailing list to newsgroup)
  Vote here if you can read USENET, but not post, or if you want the
  mailing list to become a small subset of the newsgroup, so you won't
  have to read the newsgroup.

Proposal 4.
  One-directional gateway plus newsgroup archiving under the Web.
  Vote here for a compromise between Prop 2 and Prop 3.

Proposal 5.
  One and a half directional gateway.  Articles are sent from mailing
  list to newsgroup.  Digests of articles are sent from newsgroup to
  mailing list.
  Vote here if for reasons I can't imagine.  Well, maybe if you
  are a uucp site, with no USENET or Web access.  Yuck.

Tony,

Thanks for pointing this out. Quite often I am browsing through some part of
the web and would like to print out a whole chunk. Unfortunately, while it is
simplicity itself to print the current document, it is really tough to print
out a collection of related material, involving multiple documents.

If we can address this issue well, it will also make it much easier to put
books and technical documentation etc. onto the web. By addressing the needs
of publishers the Web itself will become more pervasive.

You suggest:

> The most obvious thing to add would be:
>    <ONLINE>click the mouse or select item</ONLINE>
>    <PRINTED>see page such and such</PRINTED>
> But I have a strong feeling this isn't the correct way to solve the problem.

The issue you mention of how authors refer to hypertext links can be solved
through guidelines to authors on how to write such references in a form
suitable for both online and paper media. Tim has already written on this
in "http://info.cern.ch:80/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Printable.html".

Perhaps we need some structuring elements which determine how a group of
related documents can be sequenced into a form suitable for printing, along
with a way of automatically generating a table of contents, and an index.
Hypertext links could then be converted into the appropriate page/section
references.

The obvious structuring element corresponds to the contents list, e.g.

        <CONTENTS>
            <A HREF ="doc1.html">Introduction to home brewing</A>
            <A HREF ="doc2.html">Equipment Needed</A>
            <A HREF ="doc1.html">The basic skills</A>
            <A HREF ="doc1.html">Popular recipes</A>
        </CONTENTS>

i.e. in SGML terms:  <!ELEMENT CONTENTS (A+)>

This would be placed somewhere convenient with links back from other
documents using the <LINK> element, e.g.
                                                    "Previous" and "Next"
        <LINK REL="CONTENTS" HREF="contents.html">   relationships could
                                                     also be useful here.

This would allow the browser to work out how to print the material as a book
from any one of the constituent documents. At worst, The index can be
generated automatically from analysing the document text for key phrases.
Better still, would be to have markup which identifies key words or phrases.
The header and inline emphasis tags are potential candidates, but I think
we should add a new tag to support professional quality indexing.

What do you think?

Regards,

Dave Raggett,

==================
A one-way gateway will raise a severe problem.

Imagine that you read in News an announcement of x, post a followup 
and assume that it will reach x, but x doesn't read news and so will
not get it.

I would like to switch to the Newsgroup and unsubscribe from the
mailing list because I want to reduce my mail traffic. But
I still want to fully participate in the discussions on www-talk.

It will be a severe mistake if the experts will talk on www-talk
and leave the users or potential users alone on the newsgroup.

The World Wide Web needs Users to become a successful project.

The already mentioned bad example is WAIS. I don't follow the
newsgroup any more because I also noticed, that the real experts
have there own discussion group and seldom answer questions on
the newsgroup.

So I would like to see:

- that the mailing lists dies completely and there is no gateway at all

  Proposal 1, without explanation

or

- that there is a bidirectional gateway.

  Poposal 2, but I have usenet

or

- there is a bidirectional gateway and users of the mailing-list
  can subscribe to a digestified mailing-list, where they get one
  summary mail per day. That is how the Khoros Group solved the 
  problem of large mail traffic.

  Proposal 6, new one

Arnold

How should HTML+ (aka HMML) handle compact lists?

        <OL COMPACT>    or      <OLC>
        <UL COMPACT>    or      <ULC>
        <DL COMPACT>    or      <DLC>

Can you let me have your opinions please?

Also what about a means for specifying an explicit string in place
of the standard bullet for unordered lists, e.g. <LI LABEL="a)">?

Best wishes,

Actually Aleksandar, headers are *NOT* currently permitted in <LI> list
elements. Instead you should use the emphasis tags.

Should we change this for HTML+ (aka HMML)?

Hi,

some time ago we found it necessary to convert some of our
Latex documents into HTML. The result of this was a crude
translator from a small subset of Latex commands to HTML.

For more information see:
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/tex2html.html

Here is an extract from the above document:

A full translation from Latex to HTML (or SGML) is NOT possible. 
Having said that it is possible to translate Latex commands which have
direct equivalents in HTML and treat the rest of the document as
unformatted ascii text. This works for ``undemanding'' documents which
do NOT make use of equation, picture or table environments, or
user-defined commands and styles. 

The translator was created to address specific needs and it
sometimes handles some commands in a very subjective way. Although
this makes it less general than it perhaps ought to be, some of its
functionality may still be of general use.

And browsing.  As you mentioned, this would give you the ability for "next"
and "previous" type on-line browsing.  In addition you could view and
navigate through the TOC on-line.  I feel that using this kind of
information in an on-line browser can really help to reduce the "lost in
hyperspace" problem.

Would these be top level headings?  I think a level indication is
appropriate in this case, so instead you'd have entries like:

>      <A HREF ="doc1.html"><H1>Introduction to home brewing</H1></A>

While this make sense in a printed world where each chapter (node) only
appears in one book (for the most part), it doesn't make sense in the
hypertext world where a node can potentially occur in as many books as
people can dream up.  It would be up to the browser software to keep track
of the current book or books that you're browsing through.  The model would
be that an on-line book is just another "view" into the information space.
I think that this is a powerful and useful notion.

If a browser were able to automatically generate a table of contents  
(T.O.C.), you'd have all you need to print a book.

Consider FrameMaker. To generate a T.O.C. in Frame, one specifies  
which "paragraph formats" (as Frame calls its markup tags) to include  
in an automatically generated T.O.C.

If a user were to ask a browser to search for and list a  
user-specified set of tags (such as headers), and if the user could  
then select which items to include/exclude in the T.O.C., the user  
could have his/her own custom book.

But how does the user specify the limits of the search? All the Web?  
This raises the spectre of the web-roaming cyberbots discussed  
earlier. Or matches to keywords found in headers throughout the Web?  
This becomes WAIS-like. Or local nodes only? There's an issue here of  
what constitutes a "group of related documents": the author's intent?  
Or the reader's interest?

It's interesting to consider that printing a book and searching the  
Web might be closely related issues. I've come to believe that a book  
is not a document, but rather a point of access to an organized  
collection of documents. I'd be happy to elaborate out-of-thread...

>From this point of view, it seems a bad idea to include "structuring  
elements" inside documents that tie them together for printing (if  
that's what you were suggesting), though there's no harm in  
encouraging authors to provide one or more T.O.C.'s (or encouraging  
readers to contribute their own T.O.C.'s).

in regard to the question of supporting centering and right justification
and compact in html (and with apologies to anyone who gets
redundant copies):

i am a new user of html, and an old user of roff.  my first reaction
to html was "what a weak formatting language."  as i thought more
about displaying documents on a wide variety of clients, however, i
began to understand better what markup without formatting was about
and thought "what a clever idea to let clients use whatever capabilities
they have to display what needs to be displayed."  as i prepared
my first document (which is a quick reference to html by the way), i
was frequently frustrated by not being able to get things to look
quite right.  in particular, <dl> didn't seem to want to cooperate
with my aesthetic (nor did <dl compact>.)  finally, i realized that
it was the renderer, not html, that was not cooperating; html provided
a suitably defined <dl> structure, but the renderer was making 
decisions i didn't like.

extrapolating just a bit from this line of experience, i concluded that
an html renderer (or www client) should allow the READER to
define how to render html constructs.  for example, the reader should
be able to define the typeface, indentation, line spacing, and characters
used for bullets (if any) at each level of a nested <ul>. in addition,
the reader should be able to change this rendering while viewing a particular
page.  in this context, the centering and right justification questions
seem to become a matter of reader choice. the reader may choose to have
the client center headers and right justify text, or not.

having prepared documents for years, i have spent a lot of
time trying to pick display formats that convey information clearly.
it is something of a relief to imagine moving the display format
responsibility away from the information provider to the information 
consumer (not the client program, but the reader herself), who should
actually be able to do a better job of it, since each reader knows
or can discover her own preferences (provided, of course, that the
client gives them the capability). 

from this perspective the "compact" of <dl compact> is even something
of an encroachment into the responsibilities of the renderer/reader.

as i mentioned, i am new to html, so this may be old hat to the www
community, but it may also serve to remind veteran users of the
learning process experienced by new users.

On the issue of automatically generating a TOC, I don't think it would be
very easy to generate a coherent book TOC, even given a set of nodes to uses
as a basis.  You'd have the headings, but how would you order them?  I
suppose a program could try and decide upon some kind of structure/ordering
from the links in the nodes, but it wouldn't be easy.  The best use of some
kind of automated TOC generator might just be to give a human somewhere to
start from.  In a program like Frame, the task is a lot easier because you
are already starting with a limited set of information that has a linear
ordering and (supposedly) meaningful elements from which to generated the
TOC.

I don't see books as something that the user can just conjure when he or she
is trying to track down some information.  There's better ways to handle
that kind of interaction requirement.  I see books as something that are
authored by someone, much like a node is written.  The cool thing about this
is that this would make it possible for people to easily write "virtual
books" based on existing information.  Of course, they may wish to add some
nodes of their own while they're at it to tie everything together.  But the
large existing base of information is going to make organizing and finding
information easier than ever.

It sure is!  The interesting part is that the same basic organizational
information can be used in both cases.

> I've come to believe that a book is not a document, but rather a point

Exactly my point.  In a meta-sense, though, even a book is a document,
albeit at a higher level of abstraction.  Carrying this one step further,
who's to say I can't put together a "library" that contains bunch of books.
I still like to picture it as "views" on the information.  You've got access
to a giant collection of (mostly) unstructured information, and by looking
at it through one or more views the information can become much more useful.

Yes, that's just what I was suggesting.  Although it is more convenient
to have that information available, I'm afraid of the limitations that
it implies.  And if you can't already guess, I'd be all for encouraging
anyone and everyone to contribute their own TOCs.

Exactly!  (he says, blushing and hoping no one realizes that he was the one
who started this thread from the opposite side of the field... :-)

No, but I get it now, and would very much like to see this kind of
customizability added to web browsers, especially (of course) XMosaic --
especially mostly because a GUI offers so many more formatting options and
XMosaic is my GUI browser of choice...

That reminds me -- can HTML authors declare new tags?  It would seem far
too complicated for clients to deal with newly introduced styles, but
perhaps, with customizable displays, the client could just add unfamiliar
styles to the "style index", and the user could make changes as desired...
(remember I know next to nothing about the implementation of Web clients,
so if this is outrageous, please be gentle :-)

I'd vote for 1 myself, since I definately prefer it in news to mail, (in
fact I read it on a locally gatewayed copy of the list). But lets set up
the bidirectional feed if even a few poor souls cant get Usenet.  

Please please, make the gateway bidirectional.  Dont let people write
here thinking they are writing to the whole of the audience, only to
find that half the readers wont see their message.   If you want to do
that, then let us know so we can set the newsgroup to moderated and feed
anything written here (in the group) to the list instead.

Subject:  VMS SEARCH SERVERS

Hello All,

I have written two new VMS SEARCH gateways.

The first one is a regular Search server and the second is a phone search
server.

This servers can execute VMS search (like grep) commands and return a
hypertext pointer of the files found with match.
(The phone search server return the items found in each file as plaintext)

The search have AND and OR capabilities (currently just OR or Just AND).

What this server means is that it is possible to search all the *local* node
tree or define any part of the local node for searching.

I will put it in anonymous ftp www.huji.ac.il cd WWW/VMS_SEARCH

I think that it will be good if someone will do the same for Unix grep.

**
**      this server accepts the following:
**      http://node/SEARCH/intro_file_name%search_area?keylist
**      http://node/SEARCH/intro_file_name%search_area?
**      http://node/SEARCH/search_area?keylist
**      http://node/SEARCH/search_area?
**      where
**	- intro_file_name: Is an introduction file describing the search
**	- search_area: Is a VMS description of the files to search, it
**	      can be any of the following : disk:[...]*.*,disk:[user]*.ext ...
**      - keylist: Is a combination of words separated by : for OR
**           or & for AND (can't mix OR with AND YET @@), for example
**           A:B:C (A OR B OR C), A&B&C (A AND B AND C)
**	     @@ NOT PERMITTED YET !!! (A:B&C)
**
**	Important: The directory in which the server run must be with o:rwd
**	so the search result can be written and letter read and delete.
**
**      Bugs:
**	- Can't mix AND with OR

While I welcome the shift of emphasis from the information provider to
the consumer, the outlined policy has one major flaw: the presentation
becomes very boring. Yes, I like to be able to decide the font size
and family, but no -- I do not want to make presentation decisions
for every page I open. Consequently, all the H3 headlines I read are
18pt helvetica.

Newspapers, on the other hand, are very conscious when selecting fonts
for headlines. The more important the articleis, the bigger font size
is used. If the content is "soft", a serif font is selected etc. So,
the visual presentation of information can not be entirely separated
from the content. 

The conflict between the content of presentation and the preferences
of the reader has not been properly addressed yet. Either, the format
determines the final form presentation 100% (e.g. dtp formats), or the
responsibility is handed over to the reader/client application (e.g. html).

A better approach would be to let the information provider and the
consumer (represented by the client program) negotiate the final form
presentation. The information provider should be allowed to suggest
that "this piece of text is best presented using a hard font and
justified text". The client application could respond that, "yes, my
reader doesn't mind hard fonts, but absolutely hates justified text so
I'll go for ragged right instead". Etc etc.

All that is needed for the above outlined presentation scheme to
become possible is to make room for optional presentation hints when
defining a format. There goes my vote..

Seems a little late in the game for me to be asking this question, but
what is the proper interpretation of successive <ADDRESS> tags not

para? Is the assumption that they will fill in from the right, ie.
with last <ADDRESS>text</ADDRESS> at the right margin, last-1 to its
left, etc.? or is a newline implied by the as it were necessity of
placing both at the right margin?

(I've just turned up a buglet and am hoping for the easy way out :-(
).

Subject: Page Breaks and Tables of Contents in HTML
Reply-To: p.lister@cranfield.ac.uk
Date: Mon, 17 May 93 10:54:59 BST
From: "Peter Lister, Cranfield Computer Centre" <ccprl@xdm001.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk>

I would like a page break in HTML, e.g. <page> would tell a viewer to
display text following this point as if it came from another HTML
document (though it is NOT desirable that any other functions would be
limited in this way, e.g. searches). There would be a method (probably
an anchor automtically generated by the viewer) for moving on to the
next page, or back to the beginning.

To go along with this, a table of contents would be nice (i.e. an
automatically generated table of intra-document reference anchors), so
that users can warp straight to the relevant text from the beginning of
the document without having to search through a large file (whether via
a search function or by eye).

All of this functionality happens now, it's just that books have to be
divided into separate files for each chapter manually, and have a hand
crafted TOC. All I ask is that the hooks be put in place for this to be
done by the viewer. Since most systems do generate mulit-page documents
in a single file, HTML translators are made a bit more awkward if the
translator has to open a new file (and insert anchors) or kludge (like
I do) by inserting a line of dashes.

Again, XMosaic already has much of the functionality there, as the
Motif text widget forces page breaks. Maybe OSF's design constraint
wouldn't look so bad if we could structure HTML more like a real book.
I find a document so big that it forces an XMosaic page break is *very* unfriendly.

Is this supposed to affect the label for the current instance, or all
following  list items? I would prefer 

<LISTLABEL="a)">

which would recommend a label to the viewer for all future <ul>s

Have we considered

<OLLABEL3 ="%d1.%d2.%d3>>">, which would make all <OL> subsublists be labelled

4.1.3>> Index entry

%dn being replaced by the sequence number at level n. (1=list, 2=sublist,...)

To take this to it's logical conclusion, why not reduce <ul> and <ol>
(even <dl>?) to a generic list type with definable labelling
strategies. There would be one or two common ones (corresponding to the
existing UL and OL, and maybe others a, b, c.... and i, ii, iii.... ),
but specifics can be defined by the document author. It occurs to me
that legal documents would benefit from automatic labelling of things
as Section (a), subsection iii(f). Or maybe not.

From: "Peter Lister, Cranfield Computer Centre" <ccprl@xdm001.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk>

I'm about to attend a meeting with various non-tech staff from other
departments about how best to publish their info. They seem to be
strongly in favour of Gopher - probably because they haven't had much
news of any alternative from their "normal" sources, because they're
aware of how widespread Gopher is, and because they've heard that it's
easy to set up.

I shall extol the virtues of Xmosaic, and HTML documents, while
assuring them that anything they want to publish can go into Gopher,
and also that they'll be able to get at Gopherspace, Veronica, etc via
XMosaic (or www on a terminal).

However, the more I think about it, the harder it is to justify HTTP
and httpd. If I can get at all my HTML docs from within Gopher space,
why bother? All the refs from local HTML docs to other http places will
work OK (won't they??), and I can provide a trivial default page for
httpd (so that the existing WWW community who know us that way are happy).

The mapping functionality of httpd can be useful, but does it do much
that can't be achieved by bunging symbolic links in a Gopher directory?
OK, so one can map different filename formats and that has been useful
here, if not vital. However, directory browsing is *not* nice with
httpd if I have to tag every directory with .www_browsable; I want
inexpert users to be able to publish information, and I forsee problems
if they need to do anything "unexpected" like that.

HTML is great, but is HTTP worth it? I'm want practical details, so
don't send me philosophical waffle or flame me for being a traitor to
WWW, cos I'm not. Yes, I know that there are rumours that Gopher is to
become proprietary. Unfortunately, while I regard that as bad, others
here may regard it as *good*; the idea of paying for a support contract
makes them feel warm, and secure, despite what experience should by now
have taught us.

That is one particular httpd -- at least one other that I know of
(NCSA httpd) and I assume others (BSDI's, etc.) always support
directory browsing.

HTTP is very lightweight and very simple, which facilitates extremely
fast server implementations for document query and retrieval.  This
will be significant for serving many people simultaneously vs Gopher
or FTP.

It can also be argued that HTTP is more flexible, as servers can be
trivially constructed to handle a wide variety of specialized data
retrieval functions.  (For instance, a colleague wrote an HTTP 'xgraph
server' the other night that accepts URL's that contain multiple sets
of {x,y} coordinates and returns documents containing inlined images
that have the points plotted out using the guts from xgraph for the
graphics -- try that with the Gopher protocol.)

Well, this is a whole 'nuther issue.  The only thing I want to point
out right now is that there's no reason you can't pay for a support
contract for any protocol/server, including FTP, NNTP, or whatever.
And besides, it shouldn't have to be an either/or proposition -- look
at freeWAIS (CNIDR) and WAIS Inc.  And besides, Gopher will likely
still be freely available to non-commercial users, and besides, if
not, others will be doing Gopher servers that will be (if Gopher is in
fact worth doing this for; no comment from me on that one).  And
besides, blah blah blah...

Here's a practical detail, one which pushed me over the edge to setting
up an http server for internal uses.  I wanted to be able to refer to
documents (via hyperlinks) which were rooted somewhere, rather than having
to do a lot of messy stuff like "href=../../../foo/bar.html".  I found it much
easier to use "href=http://site/foo/bar.html"

a lot easier to maintain.

One could use ftp instead of http, but http is a bit more permissive about
following symbolic links (e.g. outside of ~ftp, for example).

Subject: IMG extension for Mosaic 1.1
X-Md4-Signature: b7085a5cc74060fac894bc348f629949

This is a pre-announcement that Mosaic 1.1 will include support for
Tony Sanders' ISMAP attribute as part of IMG elements (see
http://www.bsdi.com/server/walk/walk.html for details) as an HTML
extension.  

I realize that this is another unplanned change that I'm making
without getting a consensus or having it added to the spec or
whatever.  I also realize that, as with the IMG tag, it may be used
fairly widely in documents on the net even though it's not part of the
HTML spec, possibly making those documents not as friendly to other
browsers (although I hear the next Midas will support this, and
really, it's not that complex to add to an existing image-capable
browser).

There are three reasons I'm going ahead and adding support for it to
Mosaic anyway: (a) as it happens, I need to support this capability
internally for certain things in any case, (b) this adds a lot of
power and flexibility to browser interaction without too much overhead
or complexity on either client or server side, and (c) there is simply
no other way to get the same effect, due to a lack of an appropriate
CGM-style hypermedia graphics description language for use in the Web
that would support things like overview diagrams of document sets and
geographical maps with documents tied to different regions, and we
need this functionality in general.

So I hope I don't make anyone too unhappy; if anyone has thoughts or
comments, I'd like to hear 'em...

Hello again

We have quite a few documents which contain footnotes, i.e. links to
short clarifications or definitions which don't break the flow of the
main text. Other browsers generally display them separately from the
main text in pop-up windows, but they remain part of the document, not
a separate file.

I'm trying to translate these documents into HTML. Any chance of a
footnote tag in HTML to make life easier?

Pro tem, I'll probably shove them at the end after a separator, and put
intra document links there and back, but I can't help thinking there's
a more elegant way.

Let me say at this point what will be set up.  There WILL be an archive
of the newsgroup, with a Web interface, maintained at this site.  I'm
in the process of setting it up now.  So it will be possible for people
with no access to usenet to READ the stuff thru the web.

Now for my opinion.  Traffic thus far on the newsgroup has been light.
While there has been a lot of noise, this will be reduced as soon as an
FAQ is ready, and as soon as people stop seeing the newgroup message.
Hopefully this will be more true here than in other groups because they
(newbies) will have the thrill of reading the FAQ thru the web, so they
can play with the software rather than annoy us with questions.

I very much agree with the notion that for a successful web, we have to
get the newbies involved.  As it is, the mailing list is seeing some of
this anyway, and I think the mailing list is to big to handle.  If
we really really want separate channels for such discussions, I'd suggest
we do one of the following:

  1. add another (moderated) newsgroup - comp.infosystems.www.tech
    (who wants to moderate it?)
      or
  2. create a separate mailing list for same.

Bill Jansen (Wed, 12 May 1993 19:39:23 PDT) says:

I agree with Bill in leaving the style settings to the browser.
The long term success of HTML and WWW will depend on our resisting
the temptation to add style information to HTML. This is critically
important to supporting a wide range of document types, and continued
presentation independance on a wide and evolving range of platforms.
Have you see the screen sizes on PDAs?

We have a chance to come up with a ubiquitous world beating standard.
This will depend on presentation independence, lightweight processing
demands and our skill at understanding people's real needs for a wide
range of on-line and paper documents.

I would be really interested in having a look at the Docbook DTD,
and some of the background assumptions and motivation for this work.
Can you give me a pointer to where I can get further information?

When viewing an HTML document, I find it a common experience to want
to print out part of the web, not just this particular document.
Supporting a model of how retrievable chunks form a larger whole would
permit this. Furthermore, it would permit authors to exploit peoples
familiarity with printed material as an additional navigation model
to basic hypertext. Authors will need to bear in mind that the documents
will also be read on paper media, and avoid reference to clicking etc.

For this reason, I am currently studying how we could represent such
models effectively in HTML+, and analysing a wide variety of fiction,
reference books, magazines, newspapers and technical documentation.
The guiding principles are:

    o   superset of the current HTML DTD

    o   presentation independance (no style info)

    o   easy/fast to process with modest programs

    o   offline compilation of indexes/contents

    o   support the needs of a wide as possible
        range of on-line and printed material

The results so far are very encouraging. Provided you don't mind seeing
work at an early and incomplete stage, you may be interested in looking
at "ftp://hplose.hpl.hp.com/pub/dtd2.html". I would be very interested
in collaborating on this work.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett,

p.s. Tony, I am including change bars in the draft proposal for HTML+

No, it would be an abuse of the concept of what a header is. To specify
the level of each entry you really need another mechanism.

 (By the way your example is bad practice - the header tags
  should include the anchor element - not the other way round)

I have been studying fiction, reference books, various types of technical
documentation, magazines and newspapers to get a deeper understanding of
what presentation independent markup is needed. It now seems to me that
A more explicit mechanism is needed which includes tags for chapters,
sections, and subsections etc. The analysis looks really encouraging and
I am working out how to fit it into the DTD.

I remember discussing this point with Tim Berners Lee in a trip to CERN last
year. Users will want to exploit the table of contents view and the ability
to print out collected chunks from arbitary points. This suggests the need
to define links from the currently viewed document to such elements.

Hypertext links from outside into particular sections of an on-line book
are normally consistent with the notion of following references between
books - it doesn't change what the user expects to get printed. It is only
in the case where you have books which "borrow" sections from other books
that the trouble occurs.

Reconciling these two models can be achieved by:

    a)  normal links don't change the "standard" association between
        a retrievable chunk and an on-line book/magazine/newspaper etc.
        as defined by <LINK REL="CONTENTS" HREF="contents.html">

    b)  links which have the effect of borrowing sections from other
        books are special and override the "standard" association.

These special links could be designated by the REL attribute in the <A> tag.

  e.g.    <a rel="borrow" href="http://foo/bar">A borrowed section</A>

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett,

The problem with allowing headers in lists, is what do they mean.
When compiling a table of contents, the header level is valuable to
how you structure the contents. Headers inside lists would seem to be
subservient to one which aren't - but how do you compare them?

Actually the ability to extend HTML with specific semantic tags would
be useful for a variety of applications. At its most straightforward
the extra tags would be simply ignored by HTML browsers, but would be
very useful for special purpose indexing or database interfaces. Such
extensions should be declared using the appropriate SGML elements
e.g. <!ENTITY>, <!ELEMENT> and <!ATTLIST>.

Yes. Current thinking is to adopt the NCSA's <IMG> element, perhaps with
some additional attributes, and to also have an element for inline icons.

Can you tell me what you want these for. Footnotes and cross references
are best handled in other ways, while a full treatment of mathematical
equations is outside the scope of HTML and best handled by embedding
figures.

Good idea.

The approach I am considering is to allow for information to be specified
as being outside the linear flow of the document. If you look at magazines

I think there are two aspects to this:

(A) Identifying a subset of the Web - a number of asssociated HTML
    documents (and other non-text data).

(B) Processing this set in some way - eg printing it, indexing it,
    searching it, perhaps mailing it to someone while preserving the
    links within the set, etc.

For (A), the set could be determined by the author (eg, someone who
publishes a manual on the web as a set of HTML documents).
The set could also be determined by the reader, who may say "Include all
documents no more than N links away from this one".  Or more generally,
you could add an attribute to a link giving a "relevance number"
decrement: the user could specify an initial relevance count, and the
set would be all documents which could be reached from the currently
displayed one without reducing the relevance count to 0.  I think
this is appropriate for much of the information presently on the Web,
and is more realistic than expecting readers to write their own TOCs.

The actual processing of the set of documents needs some extra
information - eg, printing requires sequence information (available from
a TOC).  In some ways, it would be nice to separate the subsetting (A)
from the extra information needed for processing (B).  But its not
obvious how to achieve that.

How about more than one level of TOCs? A manual chapter could have its
own TOC, which would be linked to from the overall manual TOC.  Many
Microsoft programming manuals are structured like this.  This would
shorten the main TOC and would also give the reader the option of
printing out the whole manual or just one chapter.

Well, just to throw my $0.02 into the works, I saw such a technique
utilized under Microsoft Cinemania.  They used a broken underline vs. a
solid underline to indicate additional material directly related to the
document being browsed vs. another document.  They used this distinction
to allow for document pop-up windows to display associated material
(e.g. footnotes).

I gather from your explanation that document components or "meta"
documents are needed to determine the scope of the material which should
be printed.  I agree in principle, but would also like to present the
possibility of utilizing relevance ranking to determine the scope of
material received or printed, i.e. find document A, tell the system to
print, the system would locate all other documents "similar to" that
document and present them to you hierarchically (optionally) and then
allow you to trim the tree either explicity or implicitly (via
specifying a relevance cut-off).

Again, my $0.02.

I would be really interested in having a look at the Docbook DTD,
and some of the background assumptions and motivation for this work.
Can you give me a pointer to where I can get further information?

When viewing an HTML document, I find it a common experience to want
to print out part of the web, not just this particular document.
Supporting a model of how retrievable chunks form a larger whole would
permit this. Furthermore, it would permit authors to exploit peoples
familiarity withprinted material as an additional navigation model
to basic hypertext. Authors will need to bear in mind that the documents
will also be read on paper media, and avoid reference to clicking etc.

For this reason, I am currently studying how we could represent such
models effectively in HTML+, and analysing a wide variety of fiction,
reference books, magazines, newspapers and technical documentation.
The guiding principles are:

o   superset of the current HTML DTD

o   presentation independance (no style info)

o   easy/fast to process with modest programs

o   offline compilation of indexes/contents

o   support the needs of a wide as possible
range of on-line and printed material

The results so far are very encouraging. Provided you don't mind seeing
work at an early and incomplete stage, you may be interested in looking
at "ftp://hplose.hpl.hp.com/pub/dtd2.html". I would be very interested
in collaborating on this work.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett,

It would certainly be useful if the WAIS "spatial indexing" work
could be dovetailed nicely with the existing World Wide Web
browsers taht support direct point-and-click selection on images.

This looks like a good time to get involved in those efforts,

Subject: Planning for the future

We are ready to integrate the spatial indexing and search functions into
the WAIS code, so that rather than be an add-on it would be another  command-
line option in waisindex and would be evaluated as a word condition, preferably 
using the boolean constructs that have been added by gilbert@uibio.

Our choices are 1) integrate with the b5 code with extensions and no copyright
concerns, 2) integrate with the freeWAIS code and dovetail with Z39.50 (92)
or 3) write our own indexer and server that take cohesive portions of code
from b5 but make it easier to follow and be more extensible.

What is the best path to take to make the spatial processing code portable
so that it can be used now and also with the 1992 compliant server?  The main
programmer we have working on this is getting increasingly disenchanted with
the code noting that it is not easily extensible -- a feature that should
be pursued in new versions of the WAIS code.  We also need someone with 
discipline to collate and 'sanitize' the code so it looks like it was written
by one author in a highly structured way.  I had expected this with freeWAIS
but it did not happen.

Word is/was that the search engine will be completely rewritten to anticipate
the 1992 Z39.50 compliance.  Is this already being done?  How will it be
rewritten and how will its features be coordinated with contributing authors?
Or will it just be rewritten to accommodate attribute searching but be left
mostly as-is?  Who is doing this?

What is the best investment of our effort in the next couple of months?

When returning a document of unknown content what should the header
format say?

Options as I see it are:

1   Content-type: text/plain\n\n[raw data]

2   Context-type: text/html\n\n<PLAINTEXT>\n[raw data]
    [Is <PLAINTEXT> being depreciated?]

3   Context-type: application/binary [for binary files and]
    Context-type: text/plain [for text files]

I'm assuming option #3 unless I hear otherwise.  It will work well
if browers do something like <PLAINTEXT> for text/plain and
pop up a save file dialog for application/binary.

I presume a binary file is any that contains an octet outside the values
[00H..7FH]?  In that case, sounds reasonable to me.  Remember that
text/plain really means "text/plain; charset=us-ascii".

Yes (3).  When in complete doubt, punt to an octet-stream.

I figure application/x-cave will be enough.  People outside NCSA/EVL
probably don't need to think about this particular one, its presence
in the Mosaic code notwithstanding, but the same issue will come up
repeatedly all over the place and the answer should almost always be
an experimental (x-) MIME content subtype.

Ok, I've got my server running the latest Plexus that supports HTTP/V1.0.
It seems to work ok with Mosaic 1.0 (using HTTP/V0.9) and tkWWW 0.8 (using
HTTP/V1.0).  I'll continue to learn about MIME and tweek the Content stuff.
Please give it a whirl and let me know if you have any problems.

    http://www.bsdi.com/

The source is in http://www.bsdi.com/server/Plexus-2.0.tar.Z and
http://www.bsdi.com/server/ but you should probably wait for 2.1
so it'll be more stable.  I also need to update the docs, consider
V2.0 beta code for now.

BTW: Thanks to joe@Athena.MIT.EDU for the idea about putting
the context-type in %ext.

  There are many different possible approaches to searching the web and
extracting subsets of it for various purposes.  As architects of the hypertext
infrastructure, our job is to provide an information architecture rich enough
to support any search/pruning method.  We should avoid imposing any particular
interpretation upon the information, but rather enable others to apply their
own interpretations as they see fit.  The author of a document may choose to
publish one or more default organizations along with the information itself,
and readers may choose to select an alternate organization.  So, all we need
in HTML is a *general* way of specifying relationships between documents, which
is what we already have in the REL attribute. 

  Note that the list of HTML link relationships is not part of the HTML
standard (see http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Relationships.html).
This is good and allows for different standard "sets" of relationship values
to be defined and used.  I am reminded of the "element sets" referred to as
part of ANSI Z39.50 (ISO 10162/10163).  That standard does not require that all
clients or servers support any specific element set.  Rather, each registered
element set has a unique name; the client and server neogiate on the element
set(s) to be used in a session. Several archetypal element sets are defined for
well-defined domains such as bibliographic references, but the protocol itself
does not limit the definition of element sets in general.  In fact, Z39.50
servers can use ASN.1 to describe element sets to clients who would otherwise
not recognize those sets.

  Similarly, relationship-sets could be defined for some archetypal forms
which we all use and understand (journals, books, programs, etc.).  For
instance, while we certainly would like the capability to break out the
chapters and other components of a book, it doesn't make sense to speak
of a "chapter" of an animation any more than it does to reference a "frame"
of a book.  So, we use different sets of relationship attributes for different
types of data.  Perhaps we should add a relationship-set specification to the
document header. Something like,

<HEADER> <REL-SET NAME="US Book 153.5"> </HEADER>

If we allowed relationship-set specification within an anchor tag, then we
could support the use of mulitple relationship-sets within a single document.
For example,

<A HREF="http://foo/bar" REL-SET="CERN" REL="Made,REV">Dr. Elmer J. Fudd</A>
<A HREF="http://foo/bar" REL-SET="ISO-Journal 101" REL="ABSTRACT">Abstract</A>
ARTICLE TEXT HERE
<A HREF="http://foo/bar" REL-SET="US-MARC" REL="BIBLIO">References</A>

Of course, once we start using different relationship sets, a client may come
across a document containing relationships which it doesn't know about.  This
could be solved using ASN.1 just as is done in Z39.50.  
   
  An alternative approach would be to use multiple DTD's. Why not just
incorporate generic SGML parsing into the browsers and have many "variants" of
HTML.   We could provide a mechanism in the protocol for requesting the URL of
the DTD corresponding to the structure of some other URL and then use that DTD
to interpret the incoming document.  That is, when the user activates a link
to some document, we contact the server specified in the HREF of that link and
rather than requesting the item referenced in the URL, we request the DTD
describing the tags contained in the referenced item.  The server then would
either return the DTD, or a URL for that DTD.  Once we have parsed and perhaps
cached the DTD, we would then request the referenced item and process it
accordingly.  (I hope my ignorance of SGML isn't showing too badly here)

Announcing the availability of an experimental new service within the
World Wide Web (WWW), the Unified Computer Science Technical Report
Index.

WHAT IT IS

It's pretty simple, really.  A daemon runs and pulls index files from
many various FTP sites which archive tech reports (and similar
material.)  At present, 39 FTP sites are included in the index, with
over 1,400 reports included; both of these numbers are growing rather
rapidly.  This information is then converted into entries for each
tech report with hypertext anchors to the TR itself, producing a
really big file.  This file is then searchable for keywords by a
Simple Index Keyword Search (SIKS).  I believe it represents a
potentially nicer general interface to this informational resources
than existing methods (e.g. WAIS pointers to ftp sites).  It certainly
is not the ultimate information browsing tool, but I hope it may push
the migration towards such a little.

Note that this index only maintains pointers to papers that are
available online by a simple mouse click within XMosaic; following a
link will not entail walking to your local library or sending somebody
a check.  I do not know of any other indexing system for CS papers
which is this large and which easily allows direct network access to
the documents themselves.

HOW TO USE IT

The URL is:

    http://cs.indiana.edu/cstr/search

LIMITATIONS

This is still highly experimental, but I wanted to mention its
existence to the world so people can start to play around with it.

I'm sure there are some sites that archive TRs and the like that
aren't included in the TR listings I got my hands on.  I'm not even
done looking through the listings I have yet, so please don't bombard
me with random names of archive sites not yet indexed just now unless
you are the maintainer of one.

There are a lot of different archive sites, and thus there are a lot
of different file formats for the indexes.  Some sites don't have an
index at all.  Some sites have file structures that are not easy to
grok.  The daemon I have written understands several different types
of indexing, but does so in a rather crude way; thus, the results are
typically functional but may not always look pretty.  If you don't
like this, then you'll have to go out and persuade every site that
archives TRs to agree on a standardized index file format.  Good luck;
should take about 10 years. :-) If you would just like one specific
site (say, yours) to look a little nicer, write some code in perl to
do so and send it to me and I'll see what I can do.

Obviously, if an FTP site happens to be down when the index is made,
its stuff won't be in there.  Other errors (e.g. typos in index files)
can cause problems, but I can't really fix them.  Since the index file
is so large, obviously I don't check all (or even very many) of the
entries in it.

There are some sites with rather non-helpful filenames.  For example,
the Xmosaic browser will automatically pop up a PostScript previewer
if the filename ends with .ps (or .ps.Z or the like); however, some
sites have PostScript files without that name.  Not much I can do
about that.

Anyway, give it a try.  Feel free to send constructive criticisms,
praise, or lavish gifts.

I'm looking for a mapping from gopher paths to URL's and in particular
wonder how xMosaic, and in general WWW handles it, at first I thought
it could be done by simplistically going  

	gopher://<site>:<port>/<path>

but although this works to retrieve files and menus, it fails for the
type 7 query, this takes two forms - either with or without a search
term. 

I believe it was proposed that with a search term it should read 

	gopher://<site>:<port>/<path>?<searchterm>

but then what does a term without a query look like. 

	gopher://<site>:<port>/<path>

wont work because there is no way for a client to know that it needs to
prompt the user for a search term, or does WWW always obtain a type from
somewhere other than the URL?

You might like to check out:

http://www.vifp.monash.edu.au/techreports/sitelist.html

It is the first run at converting my technical reports archive list
(posted regularly to comp.doc.techreports, news.answers, etc) to html.
It's also available as a WAIS database (cs-techreport-archives).
Ideally, I'd like to maintain it in html, and convert it to text for
posting, but I never seem to get enough time.  It contains about 140
ftp sites that I've collected that appear to archive technical
reports.

I also maintain a WAIS database of abstracts from technical reports
(cs-techreport-abstracts).  The format I use is being used now by
several sites, so they can get their data into the database very
quickly (daily automatic checks).  The rest of the abstracts I have
either formatted manually, or written a perl script to convert (where
the conversion looks like it will be useful in the future), with more
and more of a leaning towards writing scripts (who cares if I've got 40
scripts lying around, and never used again?  Besides, I'm a
Perlaholic :-).  For information on the format, see:

ftp://daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au/pub/techreports/sites/README

and on the whole project in:

ftp://daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au/pub/techreports/README

The database contains nearly 7000 reports, with over 2000 abstracts
from about 70 universities and research organisations.

My grand plan has been to have the entire database searchable,
returning a group of abstracts, with a hypertext link to the paper
itself, or if it's not available via ftp, a "mailto:" that will allow
the "contact" for that paper to be emailed a request for the paper.
This will all be done in W3, I've been converted :-)

I can see some common stuff here, so perhaps we could talk about
combining our efforts Marc (in private email, of course).

have fun,
rik.

via anon ftp to www.bsdi.com:pub/Plexus-2.1.tar.Z or
http://www.bsdi.com/server/doc/Plexus.html
Demos of server features can be reached at http://www.bsdi.com/ (I keep
meaning to put links to all of them in the server docs, some are but not all).

It supports HTTP/1.0 pretty well now (I think).  I'll have to wait and
see what browsers start supporting before I add many more features in this
area.  I've updated the docs quite a bit (since the insides changed some).
I think it's a lot cleaner now plus I've fixed quite a few hidden bugs.
I moved a bunch of config options into the config file (things had crept
back into the source over time).  Right now it ignores Accept: and
Accept-Encoding: because the browsers I've seen so far don't send
this information correctly.

Here is an example 1.0 reply header from Plexus 2.1:
    HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
    Date: Monday, 24-May-93 00:49:16 GMT
    Server: plexus/2.1
    MIME-version: 1.0
    Last-modified: Sunday, 23-May-93 20:42:02 GMT
    Content-type: text/html
Which brings up the question of Date format.  The Date format you see is
RFC850 (as specified by the current HTTP spec).  Any reason we aren't
using RFC822 as modified by RFC 1123 format that MIME specifies for it's
dates (Mon, 24 May 1993 00:49:16 +0000)?

What are you browser writers thinking about supporting wrt HTTP/1.0 request
headers (e.g., see the kerberos proposal below)?  We need to think about
how to implement the ChargeTo: and Authorization: headers in a generic
way so the browser can easily support different styles.  I would
like to see From:, User-Agent:, and Referer: being used (currently
I've only seen "Accept: text/plain" and "Authorization: user xxx").

If the browser just forked an external program with it's stdout pointing
to the network and let it send whatever headers it needed that might work
(what arguments would it need? maybe just the URL).  However, this might be
too inefficient.  I think the right way to do it is build the
browser on top of some extensible language (lisp, tcl, forth)
but that's not always an option.

I'll probably be doing another release in the near future (hopefully with
the kerberos stuff mostly done).  Here is my current proposal for the
kerberos additions, the XXX part needs work.  I haven't figured out what
unique thing to encode and send with each request to verify the client.

Ideas/comments welcome.

Proposal for kerberosIV Authentication using HTTP/1.0

I am considering this scheme for adding kerberos authentication to
existing Web software (other ideas are welcome).  The purpose of this
proposal is to solicit input from users and browser developers about
what they would like and hopefully to agree on something so that
browser writers can implement it and everyone can start using it.

Steps that require user interaction are marked with a ``*''.

Initial browser-server interaction:

    * 1) The user requests a document that is restricted (unknown to her
	 or the browser).
      2) The browser sends the request as currently to the server.
      3) The server returns ``402 Payment Required'' with the Cost: field
	 filled in.  For now assume ``Cost: 0''.  Also, the server would
	 return an X-kerberosIV: field with it's Instance@Realm information
	 e.g., ``X-kerberosIV: web.userid@BSDI.COM''.
    * 4) The browser detects the 402 error code and intiates a dialog
	 containing the information from the Cost: field and requests
	 the password which is used to authenticate the user in the
	 servers Realm and get a ticket for the servers Instance.
      5) The browser then reissuse the request sending along a header
	 ``Authorization: kerberosIV-1/x-ticket,x-ident''.  The x-ticket
	 and x-indent specify additional headers for the server to check
	 for the kerberos information.  x-ticket: contains an ASCII
	 encoded ticket for the server; x-ident contains a short message
	 encrypted with the session key and converted to ASCII (see Note 1).
      6) Server verifies client information and sends the requested document.
         The Content-encoding: field would be used to specify the document
         encoding (if any).  X-kerberosIV-safe for authenticated documents or
         X-kerberosIV-private for encrypted documents.

Secondary browser-server interaction:

    * 7) The user requests a restricted document 
      8) browser detects server and sends cached authentication information
      9) server returns document, unless cached information is invalid then
         go back to step 3.

Note 1: This is to prevent message replay.
    XXX: What should go in this message?  Needs to be unique for each request,
    XXX: and encrypted with the session id.

Thanks to Nick Williams for hashing out this idea in email with me.

Subject: UPDATE: Warchie
Date: Mon, 24 May 1993 09:30:47 +0100
From: Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>


Version 1.2 of Warchie, a World Wide Web to Archie gateway,
has been installed and tested on the NeXor Server:

    http://web.nexor.co.uk/welcome.html

This new version has an option of sorting the archie results by
date, and has matured from a single file program into a full
distribution. It has been running happily over the last couple
of weeks, and I've had no complaints (then again, I've had no
comments at all :-)

What I'm looking for is people to run it near CERN and in the
States (or anywhere else!): that would reduce network bandwidth
and improve performance... anybody want to give it a try?
For details see http://web.nexor.co.uk/warchie/setup.html

Incidentally, does anybody know where in the web a URL

	http://web.nexor.co.uk:1993/archie HTTP/1.0 <-- NO!

appears? I keeps popping up in my logs, but it is invalid in the
context of Warchie... If you want a link to a Warchie server use
one listed in

	http://web.nexor.co.uk/warchie/servers.html

Any comments/suggestions are more than appreciated.

A yes/no confirmation dialog is useful if there is a real cost, but the
browser should never see the password.

1) Kerberos should normally be invisible to users; there should be a
TGT whenever the user is logged in.
2) AFS kerberos uses a different password->key mapping, so you'd have a
problem with AFS sites. (Problem #1; how do you tell apart sites using
AFS Kerberos? We use AFS with MIT Kerberos).
3) It's bad policy for users to get into the habit of entering their
passwords into programs other than passwd, kinit and login.

we'd be happy to try a Kerberised client and server, as authenticated
info serving is something of a wish here.

I have written a crude but effective script which takes SGML output
from DECwrite and groks it into HTML. It's a first pass, and not
comprehensive, but it has got a few existing DECwrite docs into WWW OK.

The easy stuff is just direct translation, but because DECwrite handles
nested lists different to HTML, there's a lot of code devoted to them.
I've also got it to put footnotes at the bottom of the page, and
rebuild a table of contents. DECwrite SGML, would you believe, outputs
the page refs in a TOC as the actual page numbers as per A4 paper. :-(

The script is at http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/test/decw2html

If any DECwriters out there try it, do let me know. Ta.

Nick Williams pointed out to me that the "HTTP/1.0" bit that causes
Warchie to treat it as an invalid URL is in fact valid HTTP.
So it probably isn't in a document but in a browser somewhere.
Anyway, I had a look the various specs and changed Warchie so it
ignores further words after the URL.
Thanks Nick!

Yes, for a single realm.  The problem is that with the Web you are reading
documents from all over (many possible realms).  Are you going to require
that the user kinit in a shell window for each document at a different
site (possibly having to exit the browser each time for line-mode browsers
with no job control)?

It would have to be a different protocol  I chose kerberosIV-1 as the name
of this protocol, another might be kerberosAFS-1, there would also be
kerberosV-1 and maybe even kerberosIV-2.

I cannot think of any other reasonable solution with the current

I'm not "requiring" it, Kerberos is. How many Kerberos realms you are
known to? I'm known to only 2 (possibly 3). Cross realm authentication
doesn't work yet. I may indeed look at lots of docs at lots of sites
around the net, but I am not known to most of the Kerberi in the world,
and I am certainly not in any way privileged elsewhere in the world.
The reason I (and I suspect most people in the world) want
authenticated WWW is so that privileged folk at a site can read
confidential docs and lock the rest of the world out. When proper
cross-realm authentication is in widespread use, no-one will have to
enter passwords to get a foreign ticket anyway.

As to job control, line mode browsers start telnet happily enough, so
they can run kinit the same way.

But it's NOT a different protocol!! AFS Kerberos is the same procotol
as MIT Kerberos. The only difference is in clients which translate
passwords to keys - kinit, kpasswd and login. It just confuses matters
to treat them differently. The easiest solution is a Kerberos client
which understands both, which is invisible to HTTP.

Neither can I. However, I'm trying to be realistic; after 3 years of
looking after a Kerberos authenticated system, I think I know it fairly
well. I don't think you can get round this problem. Any "roll your own"
solution is useless unless everyone ELSE has it!

I'd guess that browser writers don't want to put Kerberos functionality
into their software - far easier to just run kinit/klog or the local
X11 ticket manager/password changer. Tyro users see the interface that
they're used to, rather than a line mode "dialog box".

Kerberos functionality in plexus is great, but won't be used unless
there are Kerberos aware browsers, so let's not make life difficult for
browser writers by insisting they re-invent wheels. I'd prefer them to
devote their talents to making the Web look nicer.

	Well, this is the problem.  The solution is not to use something like
Kerberos to authenticate a user to a publisher, since Kerberos does not scale to
the level we are going to need on the Global Internet.

	The easy solution is to support the idea of "authentication servers"
where the user is a member or subscriber to an authentication server which is
responsible to identify the particular user to potential publishers.  The
publisher is a subscriber to the same or a different authentication server (and
in this case, we assume that the authentication servers have a trusted method to
share the burden.)

	Let me try a real world example:

	aUser subscribes to AuthenticationServer-A.		
			(happens only once)

	aUser authenticates herself to AuthenticationServer-A via Kerberos.
			(happens once per session)

	aUser is now ready to receive documents.
	-----------------------------------------------------
	aPublisher subscribes to AuthenticationServer-B.
			(happens only once)

	aPublisher authenticates itself to AuthenticationServer-B.
			(happens when publisher reboots)

	aPublisher is now ready for business.
	-----------------------------------------------------
	aUser wishes to retrieve aDocument from aPublisher

	aUser requests aDocument from aPublisher
		-- Along with the request goes something along the lines of:
			AuthAgency	AuthMethod	UserCredentials
			----------	----------	---------------
			Server-A	Kerberos        [HOSTNAME] 
							[USERNAME] 
							[KERB-TICKET]  (opaque data)

			a URA (Uniform Resource Authenticator) might look like:
			Kerberos://Server-A/hostname/username/kerb-ticket

	aPublisher checks with AuthenticationServer-B for aUser's credentials

	AuthenticationServer-B does not recognize aUser

	AuthenticationServer-B contacts AuthenticationServer-A and requests
	credentials for aUser

	AuthenticationServer-A returns the proper credentials and...

	well, you get the picture....


	The idea here is that Kerberos by itself is not an authentication
service.  It is a mechanism which can be used to develop such a service.

	I would assume that all the AuthenticationServers might use Kerberos to
share info between them, and that all the Users might use Kerberos to
authenticate themselves to the AuthenticationServers.  Of course, there is room
for more and less robust mechanisms as well, depending on the publisher's needs.

	There needs to be a major infrastructure of authenticating and authorizing
capabilities on the Internet to support "publishing."  It is not simply a
question of client/server (consumer/producer) because the model does not scale.

	Ahhhh... but I am.  <smile>  O'Reilly is hoping to take a lead here, and
we are actively developing an document which outlines the problems and proposes
a solution.  We are also developing a testbed application, and will ultimately
make this available to other publishers and the network at large.

	Anyone interested in particpating, (at this point, in a discussion, but
perhaps in the beta-release), should drop me a line.

This is fine, I only said the browser should detect failure due to Payment
Required (code 402) and initiate a dialog that requests the password, I
didn't say you couldn't exec kinit to do the work.  I just don't want the
user to have to type in the kinit request by hand each time he changes
realms (even if only once, the browser and its helpers are free to deal
with this however is best, including caching TGT's for different realms).
If a user is already kinit'ed to the required realm the browser should
not have to do anything, again it's up to the browser and its helpers
to do the right thing.  You also need a way to generate the additional
headers on each request using some external program (because you can't
keep sending the same headers and avoid replay).

It is up to the browser writers to do this in a generic way so they can
support multiple authentication schemes.  It would probably help if the
server returned a header like Accept-Authentication: with a list of the
authentication protocols it accepts.  Tim BL, do you want to address this
in the HTTP spec?

Another way to attack the problem is just inject the raw authentication
protocol in the stream at some point (hand off the socket to an
external program and let it do all the work).  Tim: is this allowed?  What
do you think about it?  I don't think it would break anything since it
would only happen if both the client and server agreed on the
Authentication: protocol.  Comments?

I hope to do some prototyping at some point in the next few weeks.

FYI: the problem I'm trying to solve is not so much local access to
documents (you could simply check IP address for that and get most of what
you need) but rather the purchasing of books and other services over the
Internet.

Well put. At Cranfield we are interested in the first instance in
restricting a small area of our web to privileged local users only;
simple Kerberos 4 will do that fine. In the future, however, we
definitely want electronic subscription to journals etc, which requires
widespread the authentication described. However.....

No. What you just described was (effectively) cross-realm
authentication, and the authentication in your example *did* happen via Kerberos!!

ServerB has to contact serverA, and ask it for credentials for aUser.
ServerB can only trust those credentials if the servers trust each
other (or at least B trusts A), so each must hold a key for the other's
TGT service. This requires that their administrators communicate the
keys out-of-band (just like a new user being verbally told their inital password).

It's impractical for every Kerberos server to exchange tickets with
every other, so there needs to be a hierarchy, just like the domain
name scheme (especially since kerberos realms are conventionally
domains name UPPERCASED) - so, if want to authenticate to ORA, I do so
by a multi-hop authentication - cranfield shares keys with a UK auth
server, which shares keys with a US auth server, which shares keys with
ORA. As a detail, the actual servers themselves don't actually talk;
like DNS, each passes a reference and a ticket back to the client,
which then talks to the next server in the chain.

Cross-realm authentication is well understood, and is not limited to
electronic publishing. However, I think the lack of an application
which needs cross-realm authentication has limited it's use and not
justified large-scale organisation. Hopefully, WWW is that app. If they
aren't doing so, I implore ORA not to re-invent this particular Kerberos wheel.

OK, fair enough. But you didn't say I could, and I'm usually right to
assume (omission in description) -> (lack of function) (e.g. when
reading vendorhype).

I appreciate that you're interested in publishing. So am I, but I have
a more immediate requirement which ordinary Kerberos will satisfy. I
want to restrict certain document to certain INDIVIDUALS, but allow
those individuals to use ANY workstation (even at a remote site). IP
address filtering won't do that. I don't want simple Kerberos
functionality to be delayed for months while the rest of the community
argues about the finer point of widespread publication.

If this sounds really negative, it's not meant to be. I loudly applaud
the efforts of the folk who are doing this! :-)   :-0 :-0 :-0 (3 cheers)

Much opinion seems to be that line and page breaks are against the
spirit of HTML. I disagree, as I think there are cases where some
information of this sort is vital to a document.

It came to me last night that the obvious example is poetry. To quote a
poem in an HTML document, how does the WWW suggest that HTML should get
the line breaks in the right place? <p> is suitable between verses, but
between lines. I really don't see that adding <newline> will cause
problems. Similarly, I think that page breaks between poems are
entirely suitable; all the anthologies I possess are one (maximum 2)
poems per page, and there's alot of whitespace.

BTW, would it make a difference using &NEWLINE; and &NEWPAGE; elements
instead of tags? I can't comment on the pros and cons, but I note that
e.g. DECwrite SGML uses elements, not tags.

Sigh. Here come the flames. :-)

This brought me on to mathematical expressions. There is real
requirement for these in technical documents, and at the moment all I
can do is include a bitmapped image screen dump in a document, or link
a dvi document containing a compiled TeX expression and hope that the
browsing end has xdvi. Not good when the TeX source is circa twenty
bytes. What's the general opinion?

The general opinion, I think, is that TeX's syntax should be used.
That equates to a LOT of work.  Anyone feeling particularly wealthy
today?

X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.2


There's been lot's of discussion of late about all the wonderful
things we can put in HTML, to make it do this, or that, or the other
wonderful feature.  To format or not to format.  Include images.
Include tables.  Include widgets.  Sound, movies, sensaround, free
food, etc.

I really think we're going the wrong way here.  HTML was always meant
to be a small, even minimal document type.  The promised strong point
of the web would be multiple document types, all tied together within
a structure of HTML documents.

HTML only provides the framework by which lots of other document types
are accessed.  You want to do lot's of neat TeX things?  Use TeX.  You
want to do something with integrated text and graphics?  Use Postscript.
You want to define a single document as a collection of different
things?  MIME does this for you.  On the other hand, if we make it a
de facto requirement that everything available thru the web must be
HTML, I think we limiting ourselves severely (and being somewhat
egotistical).

MIME is supposed to be where all of our work is going right now.  By
developing a good MIME document viewer, and a good transport mechanism,
we can do all this (and come up with interface to read MIME mail and news
while we're at it).  And we set up a system which can be easily extended
to document types that haven't even been designed yet.

Last, let me make another pitch for HTPS.  HyperText PostScript.  HTML
provides the structure, and other document types provide the data.  But
sometimes it'd be nice to have the structure and the data all together.
It would be trivial to add an operator to postscript which defines anchors
as arbitrary paths associated with URLs.  That should satisfy most anyone's
desire for arbitrarily composed documents.  If anyone is interested in
implementing this, contact me, I have some good ideas.

Not that this will be trivial, but I was wondering about the possibilities
of a \TeX{} ``server'' -- a hacked up version of TeX that would accept
a few bytes and hand you back a DVI fragment.  THere is a lot of code
around for rendering that to a bitmap.  I haven't looked at the TeX source,
but it can't be a huge job (:-).  There are of course lots of questions,
such as what kind of TeX environment to assume, how much of the DVI file
actually has to be sent, etc.  

The biggest question is -- will the performance be adequate? TeX is a bit
sluggish to get going, particularly, I suspect, if started from inetd for
each twenty byte formula.

I am very interested in this because of the potential use of HTML browsers
for building codes and structural design standards.  These documents
typically have a lot of mathematical expressions -- a typical clause
is 1/2 page long and contains a formula of some sort.

I also want the formula to be ``active'', i.e. usable in a calculator-like
fashion.  For ideas on what this might look like, see MathCAD for Windows.
I have a Master's student now looking at it -- over the next month or two
we hope to float some proposals around.  I would be pleased to hear from
anyone that has doen some similar thinking.  I might be able to supply
a bit more detailed abstract in a week or two, if anyone is interested
in more details of the proposal.  I have been toying with these ideas
for ten years or so, so I have a fair understanding about whats required
on the computation side.

The kind of documents I am most interested in are about 50\% math
and 50\% text with {\em lots} of cross-references.  It is important
that the math appear in-line with the document.  A typical unit (node)
is 1/2 page.  I worry about performance if, for example, the math
portion is farmed out to TeX/xdvi for rendering, and I wonder whether
an acceptable cacheing scheme can be found (perhaps it can).

I was attracted to HTML for this purpose because of the nice tools
that are now available, in contrast to other mechanisms.

If we could actually come up with something that blends TeX with HTML
it would win us a *lot* of users who are ready to switch _today_ in
order to get the advantages of online hypermedia.  Unfortunately, I
think the complexity plus the corresponding workload involved in
creating and supporting tools to actually use such a format are
prohibitive in the near term.  (What's my point?  I'm not sure I have
one...)

Thanks for your interest, and for sending me your DTD. I really like the
change to the container model, and other SGML experts have told me that as a
rule, it is much better for verification purposes. A separate advantage is
that it allows you to make link destinations pick out a much wider variety of
containers than the <A NAME=foo> element, which is restricted to text and
inline emphasis.

My main objective is backwards compatibility with existing HTML. The change
to the container model shouldn't effect such documents. Another objective is
to provide support for groupings of HTML documents that form on-line books,
magazines, journals and conference proceedings etc. The idea here is to
provide presentation independent markup as a basis for:

    o   indexing based upon markup (title/author/subject, topics, ...)
    o   familiar navigation model (tables of contents, indexes, ...)
    o   printing related information (not just the current document)
    o   importing books, etc into the web

These extensions must be compatible with being able to parse HTML+ efficiently
using modest programs (unlike HyTime!). I am currently analysing a wide range
of paper material to see whether these documents can be adequately described
using just a few new tags.

Some things are clearly too arbitary, and would need to be described as
embedded figures using another format, e.g. Postscript or Computer Graphics
Metafile.

Other extensions to HTML add:

    o   tables (as an extension to definition lists)
    o   embedded images/drawings (Mosaic's <IMG> tag + ISMAP)
    o   forms (input fields and selection menus)
    o   nested lists
    o   change bars
    o   floating panels
    o   a few new semantic tags for indexing purposes

It would also be great to add support for annotations of various kinds, with
forward references from documents to responses etc. Further work is needed to
clarify the implications for the markup language. Anyone like to take this on?

You can see the current state of the DTD in:

    ftp://15.254.100.100/pub/hmml.dtd

Please remember that it is still at an early stage of development, so don't
expect too much consistency or completeness right now. Comments are welcome.

I appologise to those people who couldn't get access to hplose.hpl.hp.com
and have asked our support people to get it registered with the name server.

Let me know if you still can't access this file.

If we can get this right, the opportunity is there to make the Web as common
place as FTP is now. What will the effects (and problems) be when there are
millions of servers?

Best wishes,

    Dave Raggett,

The biggest problem I have with scaling kerberos to this level is the
amount to which trust also must be scaled.  A high-level
authentication server which is responsible for providing
authentication for a lot of other servers would be responsible for a
lot of commercial traffic, and thus it's not difficult to imagine
circumstances in which it would be worth a very large amount of money
to compromise it.  What agency/organization do you trust to be so free
of possible corruption and security breaches to guard these high-level
authentication servers that could govern hundreds of millions of
dollars in commercial traffic?

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe kerberos allows
for non-deniability of orgin, which is exactly what is needed for this
kind of an application (i.e. publisher A needs to prove that request I
must have been sent from user B, and could not have been forged by
publisher A, even with the cooperation of authentication authority Q.
Otherwise they can do the electronic equivalent to forging your
signature on credit-card slips, and there's no way to prove whether
user B or publisher A is lying when they disclaim wrongdoing.)

For this kind of thing, I still think PEM is the way to go, as it will
be made interoperable with MIME (which HTTP already uses, a nontrivial
win) quite soon.  (Unless, of course, things like electronic cash
actually start being available and used.)  The only serious question
is whether the better stopgap is to use kerberos for the time being or
to use symmetric-key PEM until asymmetric becomes useful (which may
not be until the patents run out in a few years, sigh.)

(By the way, this is also going to the newsgroup.  I generally am
hesitant to post to the mailing list because I'm really sick of bounce
messages.)

I'd like to see some discussion about HMML being backwards
compatible with HTML.  I think it's a mistake to set that up as
a design objective.  It also raises questions about how WWW parsers
are going to work in the future.  I would prefer to see HTML as
a frozen thing; and HMML as the next generation.  HMML documents should
identify themselves using a document type declaration and parsers
should look for this information.  

Once HMML becomes available, new documents should conform to
HMML, not HTML.  Support for HTML continues for already
existing documents.  

Also, because HTML documents currently don't have to conform
to the HTML DTD, you have a lot more variety out there than
you expect.  It won't be easy for HMML to provide a useful
level of validation and grandfather the any-which-way-it-fits
HTML documents.

There are two things wrapped together in the above paragraphs.
First, you'd like HMML markup to be rich enough and stable
enough so that the WWW software can reliably produce the 
listed behaviors.  The second is that these behaviors are
necessary to support more complex document models.  What
we really want are the behaviors, not necessarily the complex
document models.

As I see it, HMML should be designed for effective delivery 
of documents in WWW; it should be a distribution format, not
a source, or authoring, format.   If you want to do the latter,
WWW would do best by taking the approach that it accept 
any arbitrary SGML DTD.  That may happen,
one day, but it doesn't seem like the best approach today.
The main point is that I don't want to create and
manage information in HMML;  I want to use a full SGML DTD
that allows me to create and manage my information for multiple
uses, including printing or distribution in other systems. 
I can filter from the richer, SGML DTD to HMML for distribution
on the Web.  Thus, HMML should be a useful subset of the
functionality required to deliver hypermedia documents over
networks.

Just to give an example, an authoring DTD might be concerned
with the semantic difference between COMMAND and FILENAME.  In
the HMML, we need not preserve that semantic distinction, and
we can call them the same thing.  I have seen one approach in
which all these elements were just classified as in-line
elements, and an attribute was used to preserve the original
element name.  Thus, COMMAND and FILENAME might both be distilled
into the element "INLINE", distinguishing it from things like
paragraphs, lists, and examples that are different types of
text blocks.

If we don't design HMML as a distribution format, the HMML DTD will grow and
grow to include new tags for new document types.  
Look at the AAP DTD and you will see something that tries
to support lots of different document models.  The Docbook DTD has
a more limited scope but it is still reasonably large.  Short of
supporting any arbitrary DTD, we will find it difficult, I think,
to create an HMML DTD that serves complex document models you
describe. 

HMML should still describe the logical components
of documents independent of a particular presentation.  However,
we should be concerned with presentation and distribution issues in
HMML, and define the appropriate mechanisms for doing it. In designing HMML,
we should largely concern ourselves with distilling the variety of different
document types into a simpler, limited format for distribution on the net
and presentation under a variety of different browsers.

I am successfully using the Authorization field within Hewlett Packard
for providing restricted access to Web documents:

Two formats:

    a)  Authorization: user fred:secret
    b)  Authorization: user fred

When the browser gets error code 401 (unauthorized) it asks the user
for a username and password. This is then included as (a) in all subsequent
queries to the same server (same protocol, port and host name). By default
the browser always sends the user name as (b) which it obtains from the
environment variable "USER". This avoid the need for users to type
anything if they are known to the server via the .rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv
mechanism.

This approach matches our needs well, and corresponds to the standard level of
security offered with FTP, rlogin and telnet. Its really great to see someone
extending this to support Kerberos!

I have also been studying the privacy enhanced mail proposals and the general
field of authentication and encryption based on public key techniques. These
techniques require the setup of registration authorities that permit you to
look up the public key for any person on the system.

Such an approach would allow servers to use the registered public key of a
client to check that a request indeed originated from that client.
Furthermore it would allow clients to be certain that a document obtained
from a server is indeed by whom it claims to be and hasn't been altered in
anyway whatsoever.

To do this we will need to define authentication formats for both HTRQ
and MIME headers. This needs to be done in concert with other groups in
the Internet. Is anyone interested in picking this up?

I agree -- this is a good thing to discuss.  I think HTML is
expendable if HMML can be better without having anything to do with
it.  (Whether that's the case or not, I'm not sure.  I'd guess it is.)

Yes its nice to know that other people are interested in markup for poetry
too! My suggestion is a new tag <POEM> which preserves line breaks and
that browsers are recommended to use a left indent. The <p> tag is
permitted in <POEM> ... </POEM> along with inline emphasis.

As for maths etc. I feel that we should encourage embedding of specialised
formats in the same spirit as pictures. That way HTML remains simple, while
making it practical to independently evolve other formats for specialised
purposes.

HTML MUSTN'T BECOME ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE!

It seems to important that there is a simple and efficient way of embedding
equations in HTML documents. I very much like the interface for
interactively specifying equations in Microsoft Word on the PC - however
this is quite a lot of effort to implement.

My suggestion is that we follow the approach taken with the PC and allow
object level embedding in HTML. This basically means you keep HTML small
and simple while allowing people to embed figures etc. in a foreign format.
The embedding uses a link like Mosaic's <IMG> tag. The embedded data can
be sent along with the main document using MIME's multipart capability.
This approach also allows simple browsers to negotiate the format, so
that the server can be asked to render equations into bitmaps etc.

This approach avoids the danger of HTML being continuously extended to
support an every increasing variety of needs. By decoupling HTML
from special purpose formats, I believe that the latter can evolve
faster and more effectively, than if they were tied to revisions to HTML
itself. 

That said, I am drafting a proposal for HTML+ (a superset of HTML) and
would be happy to draft ideas for supporting equations in a presentation
independent format. I don't think we should tie ourselves to Tex's approach,
but should take the good ideas from a wide variety of sources: Tex, eqn,
Microsoft Word, Mac, ...

Comments please!

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett,

Terry,

Thank you for your comments on "DTD2.html". I am still at an early stage in 
developing this, and am very appreciative of input at this stage.

When you browse through a bookstore, you work through a kind of hierarchy:

    a)  the generic classification of this
        part of the store e.g. SF, or Languages

    b)  the information on the spine of the books

    c)  the cover page - title, subtitle, illustration, ...

    d)  On opening a book the flyleaf often contains a
        useful summary of what the book is about

    e)  You may next look at the contents before
        browsing rapidly through the book itself.

It seemed a promising idea to try and support this kind of behaviour
for on-line media. For instance you could see reduced pictures of
the covers of several books at once. This hierarchy would also
serve in searchable catalogs of available material.

The idea of the FLYLEAF tag was to provide markup that captures
part of this hierarchy.

> + AUTHOR and EDITOR may occur more than once.

Thanks.

>  + LEGAL, like FLYLEAF, probably isn't needed.

You may be right here - I note that the ISBN number appears in a
variety of places in printed matter.

>  + Are you contemplating nestable SECTIONs?

Yes.

I don't like them either. They are present in HTML to support
importing (scanned) documents for which a filter has no way of deciding
the original meaning.

> + PRE is not really a paragraph type, as the contents of
>    such sections need not be paras.

My mistake. The <P> tag isn't allowed in the PRE element anyway.

> + MENU seems to be simply a subset of UL, and could be eliminated.

It crept into HTML at an early stage and I would prefer <UL COMPACT>
but will have to keep MENU for backwards compatibility.

> + IMG needs some TYPE attribute.

The type is usually defined by the referenced data, preferably as a MIME
type or failing that on the basis of the file suffix or the presence of a
well known pattern at the start of the data.

Thanks!

HMML is the name of an internal and experimental DTD developed by
Pei Wei. However, things became confused when Tim Berners Lee started
using "HMML" for the proposed replacement for the original HTML DTD.
To avoid confusion I am calling the new DTD "HTML+" which also emphasises
that it is a superset of the current format.

Can you help me with a simple SGML problem? I have searched through
Goldfarb's handbook, but can't find how to specify attributes which
don't need values, as in <DL COMPACT>. Do you have any ideas?

Many thanks,

Dave Raggett

p.s. Thanks for your earlier comments on tables. I am now thinking
    about extending definition lists to support tables with optional
    title, and column headers, and limited adjustment/width info
    for efficient rendering.

Subject: Keeping HTML Simple & Format negotiation between Browser & Server
Date: Thu, 27 May 93 09:46:03 -0400
From: murphy@dccs.upenn.edu
X-Mts: smtp


There's been a discussion on www-talk about how complex HTML should
become -- and the building opinion seems to be: keep HTML simple, and
allow more complicated formats to be embedded "in-line" in the HTML,
and negotiated between the server and the client.

So for example, the client could send a list of pre-defined formats to
the server (e.g. IMG, TeX, PostScript, etc), and then the server can
choose among different formats of the same item embedded in the
document to give the client what it can handle.  Sometimes, the server
might not be able to convert the one of the things that the client
(browser) can deal with, and then it's up to the browser to display an
intelligent message about it, perhaps even giving the user information
so he can find software for his desktop environment which DOES deal
with that format.

Elements needed:

1) an ever-growing dictionary of pre-defined format names and
agreement on what those format names mean.  It has to be ever-growing
because it's a fact of life -- there's always going to be new types of
data formats coming onto the scene.  The server and the browser
(client) both need access to this dictionary, perhaps getting a new
version of it every once in a while (either automatically, or perhaps
upon the user's request)

2) The document format (HTML, HMML, whatever) needs to accomodate
documents which have multiple items in it, which could be different
types, such as an embedded graph and a mathematical formula.  AND each
of the items themselves COULD be expressed in a number of different
format types.  The information which the two alternatives convey would
not have to be exactly equivalent -- sometimes a picture is worth a
thousand words!  But if text is all your device can display, you might
settle for the words.  The person who maintains the document can put
both text & image in the document, and the image would be displayed if
possible.

3) Either:

a) The protocol which the server and the client use must allow the
client to tell the server which pre-defined format types it can deal
with, and then the server can send back a version of the document
which contains those types.
  OR
b) The protocol has no negotiation; the server sends back the entire
document and the client can sort it out.  This COULD be costly in
terms of network bandwidth and computing resources at the desktop...
  OR
c) Is there another alternative?


4) Whichever way is chosen for #3, the browser (client) needs a
lot of information in it about what the desktop environment is like
(e.g. it can display postscript by starting up XPostScriptViewer
with arguments "-f <filename> -mono", it can display bitmap images
by starting up "xv <filename>", it can display bitmap images
by starting up GIFFER,  etc).


5) The user will probably want to be able to customize how the browser
chooses desktop applications (e.g. he installs a new image viewer, or
a device driver & software for sound playback).


The complexity of how to translate and display these "foreign" formats
could then be shifted to the OTHER applications in the desktop
environment, and kept out of the browser, and out of HTML.


Problems with this model:

1) If the browser starts up another application to handle a portion of
   the document in a foreign format, what happens if that item in the
   document was SUPPOSED to be in-line with other portions of the
   document?  How does the browser pull it back into the display of
   the document and make it part of the whole?

   Perhaps 
   a) There's a way to tell the application to dump the results into a
   file or a pipe, which the browser then reads & incorporates into
   the document or

   b) HTML accomodates embedded binary data, with a tag introducing it
   as sound, or a bitmap image, or whatever, and an integer which says
   how long the binary data stream is in bytes.  But I believe the
   assumption here is that the server MUST know about the devices that
   are at the desktop in order to generate, e.g. a reasonable image.


2) What if one wants to put hot-spots (links) into one of these
   foreign format objects?  For example, suppose one wants the user to
   be able to point & client on a portion of the mathematical formula,
   which is linked to another mathematical formula (or a graph, or a
   piece of text, etc) which more fully explains it?

Good idea, that's a very important hook.  Can we end up making IMG just
a special case, or at least just an alias?

Right, this will be significantly more efficient for some retrieval
mechanisms (especially when authentication and authorization is involved),
and a little nicer for servers to organize their documents.

How do you plan on doing this in HTML+?  Sounds like the first part
will be text/html, where the anchors reference other parts.  The reference
can be done by defining a URL access type of "part", e.g. HREF=part:XXX
where XXX is a Content-id.

This is somewhat in conflict with bundling as multiparts, since the
negotiation would need to be when asking for the compound document
(which is before the browser expects to get a specific obscure type).

HTML and HTML have a status in between a formatting language and a
spacific application.  As a delivery language for very wide
use, the tags must be generic thimselves.  STRONG emphasis
or EMphasis is not a formatting instruction, it is semantic.
But it is not as semantic as PROHIBITION or
LOCSHELFNUMBER or MICASHEETTHICKNESS.

HTML+ must like HTML refrain from falling into eiter trap,
of being too related to markup, or of being too related
to a specific application.  FLYLEAF sounds very booklike
to me.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves what the logical
significance (rather than paper representation) of a flyleaf
is.  Normally it is a summary, much like a WAIS source file's
"description:". It is free, and provided by the publisher
to entice the reader in.  If we make it less booklike
then we can use it for say databases and cyberspace
manicure parlours as well as books.  If you can can see how
to describe something without the book analogy, then you will
have something more flexible for the future. As who knows
what ORA will be publishig in  a few years' time? :-)

That's easy, MIME types are registered with the Internet Naming Authority,
IANA.

I'll wave the MIME flag again and point out that MIME has a modular
bundling mechanism -- the embedded object can be of type multipart/mixed.

MIME again!  The MIME type multipart/alternative allows you to specify
a series of alternative objects, ordered by preference.

More HTML enthusiasts should check out MIME.

I agree that flyleaf sounds like a bad idea.  In fact,
Dave's navigational steps that lead to choosing a book
in a bookstore is not a good guide to describing the
logical structure of the information.  As Tim says,
Summary or Abstract describes adequately what the information
means; how it used or arranged are aspects of application,
whether defined in the app interface, style sheet or user's
navigational actions.

This justification doesn't sound terribly good.  If we can't infer the
meaning of the font changes, perhaps translating the scanned document to
HTML is inappropriate; perhaps the scanned document should be stored in
TeX or Postscript or GIF, depending on what other image characteristics
of the document seem important.  Or perhaps the font change information
should simply be discarded on conversion to HTML, as it does not
translate to meaning.

Or perhaps the right way to think of these is to apply the output rules,
in reverse.  That is, the user can specify how <EMPH> is to be formatted
on output; similarly, perhaps the user could specify how bold font is to
be interpreted on input.

I use them for preserving man page formatting _^HX_^HY_^HZ gets translated
to <I>XYZ</I>.  If you don't like them and believe they are void of content
then simply ignore them in your browser.  I believe that since HTML is
more of a delivery vechicle than a formal markup language they are required
because HTML cannot be all things to all people.  I VERY much agree that
tags should be semantic but in a delivery format I think you need to leave
a little room for slop.

If you remove <I> and <B> what will happen instead of using TeX or whatever
people will use stuff like <CITE> (or whatever formats nice in their browser)
where it is inappropriate (assuming you removed <EM> and <STRONG> for
the same reasons).

If you resort to an external format how are you going to deal with hypertext
links?  I may not be able to figure out why foo was in italics but I can
sure as heck generate a hypertext link to man pages from text like
``foo(1)''.

Well, that's not a terrible solution, but I still don't like it.  If the
man page formatting means something, it should be translated to what it
means.  If it doesn't, it should be dropped.  In either case, having
constructs like <I> in HTML will only lead to more cases of this same
problem; that is, you have some formatting (underlines, italics, bold)
in your document, but you don't know why.

The Macintosh and Microsoft Windows systems are moving toward compound
document architectures, as is X11R6.  This shouldn't be an
insurmountable problem.
With X, one could look at an imbedded object, try to determine its

This is the biggest argument for always providing a canonical image
representation of non-plain-textual data.
My dream for ultimate flexibility in the browser would be for the
server and the browser be able to negotiate the browser's needs for a
canonical, viewable image of the document. 
1) The browser would ask what size the image (or paper, or whatever)
   is designed to be viewed at.
2) The server would report the designated image size, along with a
   summary of its capacity for generating other image sizes.
3) The browser would request an image of whatever parameters best suit the
   available display.
4) The server would either
 - Image the document according to the browser's specifications,
   caching it for future retrieval by browser's with similar needs.
 or 
 - Send the one image closest to the browser's requirements for that
   document if no dynamic image generation were possible
Each link in the image would consist of:
 -  a union of rectangles designating the boundary of the link
 -  a URL
 -  a set of flags, perhaps including one indicating whether the link
    should be decorated by the browser, or whether the link is already 
    decorated in the image
5) The browser would scale the image if necessary (obviously it would
   be preferable for the server to be able to generate an image that
   is best suited for the browser, but if not the browser would scale
   the image and the corresponding regions down), then present it to
   the user.
This way, links could be provided in a reliable fashion within ANY
kind of complex data, and exterior viewers could be used to do a
better job of imaging a particular kind of data to other output
devices at the browser's disposal.  E.g., a PostScript document would
be available on screen at an appropriate resolution with links
included, and the same document (or a version of the document that
didn't have the links decorated) could be sent to a file or a printer.
It might even be possible to provide the same set of links with
something that is imaged at the browser's side if there is a
definitive representation for that data type that can be relied on.
Something similar could be done with sound files by
providing a start and stop time for a particular link.  Video files
likewise, with start, stop and a union of rectangles.

My prefered scheme for selection of links in external objects is just send
the x,y coordinates of the selection to the server and let it deal with
it however is best.  This is how the current selection stuff works for
<IMG ISMAP>.  This lets you backend with whatever you need (like maybe
WAIS spatial indexing) without hardcoding anything in the client.

This scheme has the advantages of being easy on the browser, simple to
implement, low network overhead, it fits in with the existing HTTP
protocol (even HTTP/0.9) and it's working today:

    http://www.bsdi.com/server/walk/walk.html
	Is a demo of exactly this scheme (requires Mosaic 1.0 with the
	patches pointed to in the document, Mosaic 1.1 will have this
	built-in).  Text-only browsers need to start doing something about
	<IMG> like [Sorry, image not available].

    http://www.bsdi.com/server/bookmark/demo.html
	Is another demo of image selection with a pratical side.

The HTML looks like:
    <A HREF="http://server/path><IMG SRC="..." ISMAP></A>
and upon selection the browser sends:
    http://server/path?x,y
where x and y are simply the mouse coords (or whatever) relative to the
image origin (prior to any mucking around by the browser like scaling).
If the browser doesn't support ISMAP then the URL http://server/path is
sent just like normal and the server would simply return a normal HTML
document that has textual anchors for each item you can select from the
image.

The same scheme could work for any external format with a little
cooperation from the viewer.

If I'm in the middle of sending an HTML document and I get a server error
how should this be handled? The problem is when we have already generated
the HTTP status line and the mime headers and sent part of the document
before we know about the error.

   HTTP/1.0 200 Document Follows
   MIME-version: 1.0
   ...
   <error happens here>

Right now I just sort of barf some HTML at the client, that includes an
error message, and hope it does the right thing (you might be in the middle
of a header or something).

I know that in general this isn't a big problem (the user figures out
something went wrong soon enough) but it seems like we should be able to
do this a little cleaner.

I was thinking about something like <ERROR>...</ERROR>, which could then
contain relevant facts about the error and local problem reporting
procedures if it was a server error.  Clever clients would move the
error to the top and keep all other data intact just in case it's useful
in spite of the error.

You might even use </BODY><ERROR>...</ERROR> so that clients could
resync on the </BODY> in case they are inside of a <H1> or something,
this might make the parser a little easier.

Comments?

Subject: HMTL+ DTD remarks

Regarding Tim BL's remark earlier today that STRONG has meaning,
I was wrong to lump it in with B, I, and U, which I'd like to
see dropped.  But let me deprecate STRONG on typographic 
grounds.  As very little writing routinely uses extra emphasis,
we don't have an established font change that indicates such
extra emphasis.  I think you're most likely to see italics
for emphasis and italic all caps for extra emphasis in today's
printed books.  If that degree of extra emphasis is satisfactory,
it is within the reach of authors with the STRONG tag.

If it is desired to distinguish between different fonts in the
original (scanned) document, when the reason those fonts were
used is unknown, it wouldn't it be less taxing to use a REMAP
attribute (<EMPHASIS REMAP="wasbolditalic">)?  

As for FLYLEAF, let me suggest calling all this front matter 
stuff META.  One might want to insist on some minimal order
in it, such as that the title come first.  Tim's right---no
knowing what we'll be publishing in a few years.  HTML+ might
be used for technical papers, recipes, or cartoons.

keep it simple being the key phrase (tony Sanders wrote)
and advertised his scheme for doing x,y mouse coordinate transfers

I'm new to this mailing list, and I strongly feel the need for feedback
of which part of the image has been clicked on (not neccesarely into
rectanle divided), but I would like to make it simple for writers
of documents too... 

Having the scheme of tony means that I, as provider of the document
have to write some horrible script for deciding if the mouse click
was inside my circle on the image or outside.

As I don't know all the arguments that were used in favour or against his
scheme, I can imagen some 'new' ones here:

1) not terrible simple for the document provider,
2) no feedback possible on the browserside
   (if the browser would no that a certain part of the image is linked
    to some document, it could highlight it whenever the use puts its
    mouse over it... this has the advantage that If I presented to user
    with a picture of some buildings, but only two of them are linked,
    the user would not get frustrated while clicking on the other buildings)
3) a 'simple' solution in my view is a document that would allow
   pictures to be overlayed on top of each other, with a certain picture
   color transferred into transparant (white, and black are two usefull
   choices, but any color should be selectable)

Of course that doesn't mean that all the gopher clients will be

What what what?  Sounds out of date. There was always a command line  
option -dy to allow ALL directories to be browsed (-dn allowed none,  
and -ds was the selctive option which checked .www_browsable).
Nowadays -dy is the default if you just run the daemon.

Don't confuse the protocol with the implementatins of the server.
There are some very sexy server implementations giving access
to databases in a very rich way which you just couldn't do with
Gopher.  The full pwer of the format negoctiation is still to
be used by really powerful servers... but don't knock the protcol
or the model for the software.  There are a lot of servers.  I
hear there is one coming out for the Mac too.   The practical problem
will be chosing one.

Here are some arguments.  You want the option of hypertext because
it is a better interface for your readers and they deserve nothing
less.  If you provide hypertext using a gopher server you will be  
being rather weird and won't gain you much.  (Anyone doing this to  
date?).

BTW I noticed that the gopher daemon seems to respond to HTTP  
requests, but mishandles full HTTP requests -- so Gopher servers
are almost HTTP servers -- it just takes a small bug fix and you  
could use them.  Don't know to which servers this applies.  You can
try www

It's easy on the browser, but devilishly difficult on the server.  With a
list of bounding rectangles for a link, it is possible for the links to be
saved in a static file along with the document they apply to, without any need
for an active process to mediate the clicks.  This way, hyperlinked images can
be stored on, e.g., ftp servers, or cached locally.  

In addition, with the bounding rectangles associated with a particular link,
the browser doesn't need to contact the server to follow a link, and it becomes
possible for the browser to provide feedback when the pointer is moved onto a link.

A list of bounding rectangles need not be onerous on the network, particularly in
comparison to the size of the images to begin with.

> The same scheme could work for any external format with a little

Ditto the bounding rectangles scheme.

A generic point and click scheme could be significantly better for things like
mathematical graphing systems, where the server can do a reverse map of the click
to a point in some transformed space.  This could be a good thing.

Perhaps we could have both systems?

X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.2


Here's one for you.  Steve and I were talking today about reading mail
and news thru xmosaic (because it's turning into the nicest MIME reader
available).  But xmosaic doesn't deal with keeping track of your
mail, or news (nor would you want it to).

So you fire up a server on your own machine, which deals with your
mail, parses your newsrc, and serves articles/email to xmosaic with
lots of things converted into links.

Let's see you do that with gopher.

Subject: Re: Keeping HTML Simple & Format negotiation between Browser & Server

Something like ISMAP is what you'd want for applications like, say,
a cartographic service, where the user could select an area (mouseDown
for x0,y0, mouseUp for x1,y1), and have the selected area sent to the
server, which will return the image (or vectors) for the new area.
And in the future (with common availability of 3D pointing devices :-) 
this should be easily extensible to 3D-space selection. 

This sort of application would be tedious (probably impossible for 3D case)
and clumsy to implement with the area-overlay-buttons approach.

However, one could think of lots of other applications where it would 
be easier and more appropriate to use area-overlay-buttons. Just look at
the numerous HyperCard stackwares that use ``invisible fields'' to
implement highly neat effects. This approach, however hard-coded but
no more than ``HREF='' is hard-coded, has the benefits of no necessary
dependence on a server.

So, as I've indicated to Tony before off www-talk, I feel that both are
necessary and have their respective uses. In HMML (my working version 
anyway-- have to sync it with Dave), there's a FIGURE tag which could 
be used in the following ways (fictitious services):

As with <IMG>:

	<FIGURE SRC="http://smithsonian.gov/gallery/irises.gif" 
		TYPE="image/gif">

Includes a figure specific caption:

	<FIGURE SRC="http://smithsonian.gov/gallery/irises.gif" 
		TYPE="image/gif">
	  <FIGCAP>Irises, 1889, Vincent Van Gogh</FIGCAP>
	</FIGURE>

Includes the actual figure data:

	<FIGURE TYPE="application/tex">
	  <FIGDATA>
	  ...the actual TeX notation...
	  </FIGDATA>
	</FIGURE>

An example of ISMAP usage -- server generates and returns the selected
topographic region in postscript form:

	<FIGURE SRC="http://usgs.gov/maps/topographic.ps"
		TYPE="application/postscript"
		ISMAP>

An example of invisible/see-thru buttons overlaying an image -- face.gif
is visible, and has two invisible area oriented anchors pointing to 
eyes.gif and mouth.gif respectively. Probably unnecessary, but WIDTH & 
HEIGHT could be specified to handle scaling. Also, perhaps <FIGA> should
simply be <A>. :

	<FIGURE SRC="http://sesame-st.org/whatis/face.gif" TYPE="image/gif"
		WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=100>
	  <FIGA HREF="http://sesame-st.org/whatis/eyes.gif" TYPE="image/gif"
		x0=20 y0=10 x1=80 y1=30>
	  <FIGA HREF="http://sesame-st.org/whatis/mouth.gif" TYPE="image/gif"
		x0=40 y0=70 x1=60 y1=80>
	  <FIGCAP>Spy a face</FIGCAP>
	</FIGURE>


I would, and I'm sure Dave would, appreciate constructive arguments 
for or against <FIGURE> as described above. It's of course still very 
open to suggestions at this point.

Looks good to me.  Two comments: my gut feeling is that coordinates
should be in pixel space, and that if the browser scales the image it
should readjust any transmitted coordinates to match when the user
actually selects something.  And, I think it should be possible
to specify more than one rectangle per "FIGA" (e.g...

 	  <FIGA HREF="http://sesame-st.org/whatis/mouth.gif" TYPE="image/gif"
 		COORDS="40-60,70-80;90-100,120-130">

...or something similar).

Cheers,
Marc

And if you could add a keyword like TRANSPARENT=0 to specifiy that the
color with index 0 should be transparent I would be even more happy.

This would allow very easy creation of a HREF that is *exactly* only to
mouth and not some collection of rectangles!!!!!

And it's easy for the server too: only one rectangle (the size of the image)
and it only needs a check for the color, if it is not the transparant color,
then follow the link.

It also allows for non-rectangular images inside a document (allthough the
bounding box would be rectangular.

Alternatively, one could send a simple b/w image to specify the
mouth *exactly* and don't use transparant at all

Subject: Vatican Library interface
X-Md4-Signature: 2d86186b1e1e2f934198a6f89629da53

I've done some tweaking to the Vatican Library interface we're serving
from www.ncsa.uiuc.edu (originally by Frans van Hoesel with
contributions by John Ockerbloom); the changes include...

  o All images referenced by the interface are now served via http 
    from www.ncsa.uiuc.edu, not via ftp from seq1.loc.gov.
  o All images are now in GIF format (full 256-color, same size).
  o Some tweaks to the exhibit text for readability, typos, etc.

The goal of the changes was to increase performance at the client end.
I am also considering reducing the size of all the images to 1280x1024
or less, since xv is not fast at scaling images down to size.

Also, I see LOC is in the process of putting up a 1492 exhibit on
seq1.loc.gov, and that the old Soviet archive is still sitting there
waiting for a hypermedia interface (hint hint hint :-).

Finally, if you didn't catch it the first time around, the URL for the
interface we're serving is...

Assuming I haven't broken anything while compiling and packaging up
the release over a 2400-baud line from a Mac, all known bugs are fixed
and no new ones are introduced.  Comments and bug reports to

Subject: group annotation server guinea pigs?
X-Md4-Signature: 44c0b08ffdb1de4f5152ed728875978a

We could use a few guinea pigs to try out our in-progress group
annotation server for Mosaic.  If you're interested, please let me
know.

The current group annotation support is very simple (one group per
group annotation server, one group annotation server per Mosaic
session, no security except through obscurity), since it's mostly a
proof of concept, but it does work and Mosaic 1.1 has built-in
client-side support.

Suggestions as to future functionality and user interface components
for same are welcome.

(How it works: every time you access a document in Mosaic, the group
annotation server [if you're using one] is queried with the URL of the
document you're viewing; if any group annotations exist for that
document, the group annotation server returns to Mosaic corresponding
hyperlinks which are inlined into the document just like personal
annotations.  So the assumption is that you've got a fast local net
and group annotation server host.  In the Mosaic Annotate and Audio
Annotate window there are option menus that let you select 'Personal'
or 'Workgroup' each time you make an annotation; for the latter,
Mosaic sends the annotation over a socket to the group annotation
server.)

Cheers,
Marc

On ISMAP vs Figure Anchors.
==========================

I agree that bot the ISMAP technique of returning coordinates to a  
server, and the FIGA (HMML) technique of overlaying anchors on
pictures have uses.  I feel that in fact their application areas
are quite separate.

It would be infuriating to have a ISMAP server which had some
areas selectable and others not, where you got back an error
message if you clicked in the wrong place.  But on the other hand,
a good cyberspace web will have nodes on which you can click anywhere
to change your point of view.

So let's specify both. Now for protocols.

	PLEASE KEEP OTHER INFO OUT OF LINKS

The ISMAP attribute has the problem that
it includes information in the link which ought to be
sent from the server when the map is retrieved.  I would
suggest a methodname "SPACEJUMP" say in the Allowed: return
field.  This allows the server to tag things as spacejumpable
however you ahve got to them.  If for example you convert
a URN ionto a URL and retrieve the document, then you get
a spacejumpable version.  If you have a graphics machine.
Some documents may become spacejumpable.  Having to put information
like that in the links is bad because

1.	It is duplication of information which implies
	incorrect information.

2.	It may change with time.

3.	It may be a function of client and server
	capabilities.
	
The same applied to the "type=immage/gif" which has been
suggested and Pei mentioned.  PLEASE DON"T put type information
into the link!  PLEASE use the full protcocol, using the libwww
or otherwise.

	Scale coordinates please
	
I would point out too that we can forsee smart servers which will
for example, as a function of the client, automatically generate or  
select
a 800*600 GIF to send instead of a 1200*1000 JPEG.  This will make
transfers onto low-res and/or low-bandwidth clients much faster.
It will be completely automatic. It means that ISMAP coordinates
should be scaled to say 0 - 1.0 in the size of the picture,
as pixels won't have much meaning.  Same applies of course anyway
to postscript pictures which have no concept of pixel size.


There's my 2c for today.

	Tim

From: "Peter Lister, Cranfield Computer Centre" <ccprl@xdm001.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk>

Well, I knew everyone would disagree with me. Thank you for doing so politely.

I'd like to make it clear that I do *NOT* suggest line breaks and / or
page breaks to annoy people, nor because I have a specific interest in
poetry (though I do). Dave Raggett suggested a <poem> tag, and as I saw
no smiley, I assume he was at least semi-serious. IMHO, the idea sucks.
T V Raman made a similar comment about representing the high-level
structure of a poems, but I would claim that that is not the business of HTML.

The general philsophy is to be "Keep HTML minimal". I agree, and concur
with the idea of embedding e.g. GIF and TeX. You are right, Dave, that
HTML must not be all things to all men. I would add "or anyone for that
matter". So - let us maintain the high-level representations of our
docs (e.g. poetry) in our authoring systems, and then PUBLISH them as
HTML. Some poetry is published on e.g. audio tape, but the vast
majority is published on paper and obeys the conventions of line
breaks, verse breaks, page breaks etc, even though the author may
COMPOSE it in very different terms that just don't come across when
reading it. My feeling is that HTML should provide low-level PUBLISHING
functions, but not aetherial concepts or <poem> tags.

My best suggestion is an argument to <pre> ; e.g. <pre monofont> and
<pre normalfont>. Or maybe <pre style="em">, where the style argument
can be any valid text style tag or "plain"? This allows me to separate
the lines of my address (or poem) properly, introduces no extra tags,
and <pre> with no argument can default to the normal meaning of
"monospaced, to suit a listing or programming example".

OK, on to "page breaks". Or since, this kind of terminology seems to
offend people, may I suggest "multibody files"? It occurs to me that a
special "page break" tag is unneccesary. All we need is a well
established method of handling multiple <body></body> pairs in one file.

* Browsers can search across a whole set of short bodies
* Browsers don't have to try to whack the whole of an enormous file onto a text 
  widget. XMosaic already has to break large files into "pages", so it seems 
  like a good idea to make the "pages" more logical.
* Most authors and (the tools they use) consider multiple chapters of one 
  document to logically belong in one file.
* Most readers don't read large documents from page one and progress to the end

An obvious example is a technical manual or a Usenet FAQ. All I want to
see is the index and/or table of contents, then the chapter or section
which answers my question. I don't want to wait for vast quantities of
gunk to be mapped into a window ESPECIALLY if it contains inlined
images (e.g. the Vatican library document index). Just show me the
section which is relevent. OK, if I then want to browse down the index,
fine, but let it be my choice.

It's possible that these things are solved better by Dave Raggett's
html2 DTD, but I can't get to hplose.hpl.hp.com. Care to give us the IP
address while your netbods set up the name, Dave?

I think this is perhaps a bit extreme, and in practice most people would
prefer some preservation of italic emphasis etc.  (an empirical question)

Perhaps we ought to use <EMPH> for all inline emphasis! This gets around
the problem in dealing with every growing categories for different needs.
You then would see elements like:

        <EMPH tag="author">H. G. Wells</EMPH>

The Web could then have an evolving set of well known categories.
Unrecognised categories would simply be ignored by the browser. Users
would also be able to change how the browser renders each category.

Thanks for the comments everyone. I am now considering how
to represent the structure in a more abstract manner using
attributes to carry has-part, has-property information.
This would allow generic markup to support evolving structures
for books, magazines and cyber-docs!

Thanks in particular to Tim for pointing me in this direction.
I hope to come back with some more details soon.

Just when I thought we had settled the matter!

Tim BL reminded me on the phone why this approach can't work in general.
Pixels only make sense for image data NOT for drawings, equations etc.
This means that we really do have to consider scaling the mouse click
coordinates. Tim suggests we use real numbers with 0 to 1.0 for each
axis (assuming square borders) with the upper left as (0, 0).

...

The new version of HTTP (HTRQ/V1.0) does indeed specify how clients
can signal the server which formats they can support, although I don't
know of anyone using this facility as yet.

The use of separate viewers works but is somewhat clumsy right now.
I like the way that Windows on the PC supports runtime linking
with DLLs. This allows applications to load support for particular
formats only when it is needed, and to unload it afterwards.

A simple route forward for the Unix environment would be to write
stdin/stdout filters which output bitmaps (pixmaps). Maybe we can get
people to sign up to write some public domain filters for common
formats. Browsers could then accommodate new formats by mapping the
format name to the filter (with command line arguments for attributes).

The next choice is whether HTML should permit embedded data directly as part
of the document itself. A well defined escaping mechanism would permit
both ascii and binary data: e.g.

    <embed type="text/eqn">X = sum from 1 to N of 1/Y^N</embed>

The simplest approach is to escape the "<" character, e.g. by inserting
a "\" character before any "<" character that occurs in the data (you
would also need to insert "\" before any occurrence of "\" itself).

Servers could still support format negotiation, sending different versions
of the document as appropriate.


What do you think?

I think that the HREFs should use the standard URL for the document, and the
MIME subheader for the image (or whatever) should include a field specifying
the URL for the subpart, e.g.

        Source: http://info.cern.ch/hyptext/WWW/lep.jpg

The current spec for the HTTP doesn't give a suitable field, although
Message-id is a near miss (defined according to RFC 850). I don't like the
idea of HREF=part:XXX etc. as this means you couldn't send the main document
by itself.

I would also like a try out simple approach to embed foreign data directly,
as this would much more convenient for inline equations etc.

Dave Raggett

Good idea, this is much better than a "part" access type.

Is it a near-miss because of special characters?  I.e., the content-id
of a part uses the same syntax as a message-id, which must be

   "<" local-part "@" domain ">"

The local-part is just a dot-separated series of words which must be
unique for that domain.  So if the entire content-id is not suitable
as a field in an URL, we can just use the local-part; it will still
be straightforward for the server to resolve which MIME-part is being
addressed.

I agree.  My only point is that the markup format which preserves such
italic emphasis should not be HTML, it should be something else, perhaps
Adobe Acrobat (or whatever they've renamed it to).

I think I see a smiley here, but it's not such a silly idea.  I've been
working on something similar, a procedural markup scheme in which the
reason for the markup occurs along with the markup.

Subject: HTTP ACCEPT field and MIME types
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.1a5>

I was looking through a draft HTTP 2.0 spec (may be as old as 7-Dec-92)
and noticed a potential problem with the ACCEPT request field.  One puts
a comma-separated list of MIME types as the field value.  The problem is
that MIME types can involve parameters, and some parameters may be
crucial to a client's acceptance of the type.  For example, an old
example from the MIME spec is:

                 Content-Type:  application/octet-stream;
                      name=foo.tar.Z; type=tar;
                      conversions="x-encrypt,x-compress"

This example is extreme, since application/octet-stream is usually a
no-brainer for clients, but the presence of these parameters makes it
pretty UNIX specific.  You can image other examples, such as a "lossiness"
parameter on image/jpeg, that would impact portability of the type.

Anyway, if we include parameters in MIME typing, then a comma-separated
syntax doesn't work too well.  An easy fix would be to allow multiple
ACCEPT fields in the header, with one MIME type per field.  I don't see
an HTTP stance on multiple fields, and this treatment of multiple
fields would be consistent with RFC 822 (the To: field, for example).
How about it (Tim)?

In general, HTTP 2.0 is pretty cool.  Is an RFC coming soon (or here)?

	The httpd server 2.0 and above and all browsers using the www
	library 2.0 and above support this feature.  The server
	at CERN for example supports it.  If you run the www
	line mode brwser even with DISPLAY set to point to an
	X display it will launch ghostview or xv.  So will (I
	suppose) tkWWW for example.  XMosaic doesn't do it but will
	one day, when a lot of confusion will cease.
	
	On the server side, in the current implementation, the
	dummy suffix ".multi" means "Whatever file of this name
	and any suffix which I can handle and you think best".

Hi Tim,

I have uploaded the latest copy of my DTD for HTML+ into
[tbl moved it into:]

    "ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/dev/htmlplus.dtd"


The new DTD reflects recent discussions:

    o   One tag for all inline emphasis
    o   FIG tag similar to Pei's (but no TYPE attribute)
    o   EMBED tag for foreign data (simple equations etc.)
    o   DL lists extended for tables with optional hints
    o   INPUT and SELECT form interaction elements

I don't know how in SGML to specify a tag which may or may not
have an endtag depending on its attribute values. Because of
this I have used two tags for images:

[I think (hope?) that this it is impossible to change
 the EMPTY charactistic of an element as a function of the
 attributes.  Would severly complicate parsing -Tim]
 

    a)  <FIG> ...</FIG> for captioned images
    b)  <ICON> for small inline graphics without captions

[...]

Cheers,

Dave Raggett

Subject: RE htmlplus.dtd of 1 June

Thanks to Dave Raggett for making this available.  It is 
shaping up nicely.  A few comments:

PANEL is like a Sidebar; it floats, as FIGs may.  It seedms
to me that there needs to be a default anchor point (not
the ANCHOR element, necessarily, just an anchor) for floats,
such that one can say the object may be placed at that point
or after, but not before.  

The same issue of anchor points pertains to <P MARGIN>, a
marginal note.  Unless these have anchors in the text to
which they pertain, they can be placed only by sticking them
right into that text.  This is how I do my footnotes in Tex,
but it isn't the clearest thing to read when you look at the
file.  

I am confused by INPUT and the remark that it goes to make
up Forms.  Would someone please give an example of usage?

Jay,

A good point about the commas in the Accept: field.  I hadn't noticed  
that MIME qualified the type with parameters sometimes.  It seems  
there is something strange in the example you give

                 Content-Type:  application/octet-stream;
                      name=foo.tar.Z; type=tar;
                      conversions="x-encrypt,x-compress"

that means that the MIME typing isn't coping -- in particular here  
the content-encoding field isn't coping.

There are several TBC areas in the latest version (any version) which
need to be filled in before its an RFC.  (An ID first maybe). And  
there must of course be working implementations. The libwww uses
the Accept: field. It in fact sends one field per content-type.
It's not obvious how to distinguish between w3 parameters and MIME
parameters to a type.  Maybe we don't have to.

request:
	Accept: image/gif; q=0.8; width=1200; height=100; colous=256;
response:
	Content-Type: image/gif; width=800; height=400; colours=10;

You may be interested in the following IETF BOF session.  If you intend
coming along, please let me know.  (The secretariat need an estimate of
numbers so they can allocate a suitably-sized room.)


                          IETF Meeting in Amsterdam

                               BOF Session on

                      NETWORKING MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS

               (currently scheduled for Tuesday 13 July, 1930-2200)


The ready availability of user-friendly multimedia authoring tools such
as Authorware Professional, Asymmetrix Multimedia Toolbook, Macromind
Director and many more, has stimulated much interest in multimedia
within the user community.  Sophisticated interactive multimedia
applications are being developed in many disparate subjects and for a
wide range of purposes.  Users are now beginning to ask us, as network
technologists, "how can I make my multimedia application available to
others across the network?".

In a parallel development, existing client-server network information
retrieval tools are being enhanced with multimedia handling features. 
Gopher+ for instance has been designed with multimedia data firmly in
mind.  The World Wide Web project is currently defining a new version of
its hypertext markup language, to be called HMML - HyperMedia Markup
Language - which includes multimedia support.

A third strand of activity is the emergence of network technologies
capable of carrying audio and video data across the network, initially
driven by multimedia conferencing applications.  Network technologies
such as ATM and protocols such as RTP are potentially capable of
handling isochronous multimedia data in an effective way. 

This BOF session will focus on issues which link these three strands. 
Particular questions to be addressed are:

* What are user requirements in terms of responsiveness, and what demands
  this places on the network and server system, and how these might
  be mitigated.

* The prospects for making existing interactive multimedia applications
  available over the network - eg by writing conversion tools from
  proprietary formats to a suitable open format.

* To what extent can existing network information retrieval tools such as
  Gopher, WWW, WAIS be used for sophisticated multimedia applications?
  What about the tools emerging from the research community such as
  AthenaMuse 2 (MIT), Microcosm (U of Southampton), HyperG (U of Graz)?
  Do we need another tool, or can we build on what we have?

* How can such tools be enhanced to take advantage of isochronous
  data streams?

* What relevance do standards such as HyTime and MHEG have?

The BOF is intended to test interest in the subject, to define issues
that need resoving, and to see whether a WG can be formed to work on
those issues.

Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch


[I hope the www-talk alias will now (a) work -- if you got
this it does and (b) not send back errors to those
who contribute.]

The WAIS gateways at http://info.cern.ch:8001/ has been
fixed so that it now caches source documents again,
and so can display descriptions of WAIS databases as you hit
them, so long as at some point it has seen a source file
for the database in question.  The list of source files is
now building up as people use the gateways.

The next release of the library (when tested and released) will
include this feature for all clients which include direct access
to WAIS as a compile time option. The cache will be
stored by default in /usr/wsrc rather than /usr/lib/wais as before.

Subject: HTML Doctype Declaration

In order to validate a SGML file, it must have
a DOCTYPE declaration, pointing to the SGML DTD.
Here's an example:

<!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "/work/dmg/dtds/html/orahtml.dtd" >

Now, I know that the WWW parser does not need this
information because it does not actually read
a DTD.  However, if one is validating HTML files with an SGML parser,
which is the right thing to do at some point, the SGML parser needs
this line.  It would be nice to depend upon the HTML parser
to at least know to ignore it. 

In Xmosaic, for instance, this line is displayed on the screen.  
I'm not sure how the other browsers handle it.

Channel: Internet Talk Radio
Program: Geek of the Week
Release: June 4, 1993 
Content: Cliff Lynch

On this week's "Geek of the Week," 

     Carl Malamud interviews Cliff Lynch, one of the most thoughtful
participants in the race to move libraries and publishers onto 
electronic publishing platforms.  Lynch received his Ph.D. in database
systems and is currently the Director of Library Automation for the 
University of California.  Lynch's most amazing accomplishment is the
amount of travel he puts in, far outstripping anybody this interviewer
has ever met in his ability to attend any and all events where a consensus
needs to be forged.  His tireless activities have been instrumental
in bringing the networking and library communities together.

     In this interview, Cliff Lynch discusses online publishing, looking
at the issue of SGML as a markup language and examining the question of 
presentation integrity versus the desire for revisable form documents.
Lynch also discusses the Z39.50 protocol, the scaling of very large
databases, the democratization of publishing, and the role of the
Coalition for Networked Information.

     Geek of the Week is sponsored by O'Reilly & Associates and by 
Sun Microsystems.

NOT in 1.1.  Are we clairvoyant, or what?  :-)

Version 1.1 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, is now available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/xmosaic-source/xmosaic-1.1.tar.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sun.Z

                            .../xmosaic-diffs/xmosaic-1.0-1.1-diffs.Z

NCSA Mosaic provides a consistent and easy-to-use hypermedia-based
interface into a wide variety of networked information sources,
including Gopher, WAIS, World Wide Web, NNTP/Usenet news, Techinfo,
FTP, local filesystems, Archie, finger, Hyper-G, HyTelnet, TeXinfo,
telnet, tn3270, and more.

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DECstation 5000-200 (Ultrix).
  DEC Alpha (OSF/1).

Rumor has it that Mosaic will compile on systems like:

  Hewlett Packard HP/UX 7.x, 8.x, 9.x.
  Dell SVR4
  Sun Solaris 2.x
  SCO Open Desktop
  Harris Nighthawk
  NeXT BSD

Documentation is available online.

Changes since 1.0 include:

 o Hotkeys in document view windows.  
 o Color leaks and glitches in inlined image support fixed.  
 o Support for TMPDIR environment variable, as well as resource 
   tmpDirectory and command-line flag -tmpdir, for specifying
   location of tmp directory for transient data files.  
 o Added GUI-supported modification of hotlist entry titles.  
 o Added ISMAP tag support to IMG tag (courtesy Tony Sanders).  
 o CSO phonebook support (courtesy Lou Montulli).  
 o Added printing/saving straight to PostScript (courtesy Ameet A.  Raval).
   No support for images yet, though.  
 o Fixed typo in Motif 1.2 support in HTML widget.  
 o Fixed typo (nothing was broken, just caused it to be a little slow
   sometimes) in document page handling.  
 o Two spaces between sentences in pretty selections now.  
 o SGML comments are now ignored.  
 o Updated copyright notice.  
 o Documentation hyperlinks point straight to new NCSA server.  
 o Mosaic can now be remotely controlled via signals by a parent process;
   e.g., to allow use as a browser for context-sensitive help from another
   application.  More information coming...  
 o Default rgbViewerCommand is now 'xv' on non-SGI platforms, since xv
   3.0 now handles SGI RGB files.  
 o New WAIS interface document, pointing to NCSA gateway.  
 o URL of document is now sent in 'Mail To...' messages.  
 o <cite> now supported.  
 o <blockquote> now supported.  
 o <var> now uses italics.  
 o Fixed rare parsing/layout coredumps.  
 o Fixed rare pretty selection coredumps.  
 o Fixed stupid memory and file-handling glitches; made hotlist and other
   config file-handling much more robust.  
 o Properly handle (nuke) newlines in titles and URL's now.  
 o Fixed rare stupid coredumps in Motif lists.  
 o No more coredump when saving/printing/mailing empty file.  
 o Mosaic now has no default geometry resource value.  Initial window
   placement and toplevel dialog placement will be entirely according to
   your window manager's settings.  
 o Added resource percentVerticalSpace to allow customization of the space
   between paragraphs, between headers and paragraphs, etc.  in the HTML
   widget.  
 o Fixed coredump when starting Mosaic with home page a directory with
   no slashes in the specification.  
 o Added recognition of '.gz' for gzip'd files, as per GNU change.  
 o Fixed glitch with X bitmaps served by Gopher servers as inlined images.  
 o Added editres support.  
 o Added Motif 1.2 tearoff menu support.  
 o Better DEC Alpha OSF/1 support.  
 o Better Dell SVR4 support.  
 o A few more source cleanups for NeXT support.  
 o Reorganized Documents menu and added new options to Help menu.  
 o Added support for group annotation server (not yet available).  
 o Cleaned up src/Makefile (some).  
 o Suffixes .dump and .saveme are now recognized and trigger binary
   file dump to local disk.  
 o Busy cursor now shows up more often, like it should.  
 o HDF files are now recognized and passed to Collage via Collage's -load
   option, which isn't yet in a released version.  
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.  

Comments, questions, and bug reports should be sent to
mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in advance for any feedback you can
provide.

Bob Stayton, Technical Publications at The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
has requested that we include support for subscripts and superscripts:

I have just added these as presentation styles to the inline emphasis tag:

        There has been a lot of interest lately in
        mc<emph tag="super">2</emph>.
i.e                                                  2
        There has been a lot of interest lately in mc .

        (HP-speak for measurement, computation and communication)

The suggestions for rendering emphasis are:

    a)  allow users to tailor the display via user prefernces
        e.g. italic, bold, underline, highlight, super/subscript

    b)  default to italic or highlighted text for unrecognised types


These changes will make their way to the CERN copy soonish.

Regards,

Dave Raggett

p.s. Does anyone mind if I change the generic emphasis tag from EMPH to EM?

When I use www_2.06 to retrieve a document, for example

	www_2.06 -source
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/1327-tutorial.2.ps >/tmp/foo.ps

each line of the resulting file seems to have an `extra' carriage-return
character appended to it.  That is, if I retrieve the same document via
ftp, there is no such carriage return on each line.  Is there some
switch or resource which will defeat this behaviour (at least under
UNIX)?  Trying "-n" doesn't seem to help.

Subject: Building XMosaic 1.1 on HP/UX 9.0

Here are a few observations about building XMosaic 1.1 on HP/UX 9.0 or 9.01
that may help speed up the process for others. 

First, NO changes are required to any of the source in the XMosaic
distribution, but there are some changes needed in the Makefiles and in
some of HP/UX's locations for include files. Here's the summary:

Building libwww:
----------------
Nothing really has to change here for 9.0. Simply uncomment the appropriate
lines in the Makefile. Under 9.0, a new compiler option has been added,
"-Ae", which takes the place of "-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE", but libwww builds
fine the way it is.

Building libhtmlw:
------------------
This was the problem child. HP/UX 9.0 includes Motif 1.2, which needs X11R5
as well. This version of Motif quickly fills up the C Preprocessor's symbol
table, so the OTHERFLAGS variable needs to be changed as follows:

OTHERFLAGS = -W p,-H256000 -DMOTIF1_2 -I/usr/include/Motif1.2 \
              -I/usr/include/X11R5

The "-W p, -H256000" passes the "-H" option through to the C preprocessor,
allocating more space in the symbol table.

The X11R5/Motif 1.2 combination also eliminates the X11/Xmu directory from
the include tree. I found that it was necessary to create a symbolic link
in the /usr/include/X11R5/X11 directory named Xmu that was linked to
/usr/include/X11R4/X11/Xmu. This got things to build, but it seems like it
shouldn't be necessary. If someone knows a better way to get this to work,
please let me know.

Building xmosaic:
-----------------

Only 2 lines needed changing for HP/UX in the Makefile to get xmosaic to
build. The CFLAGS line is changed to:

 CC = cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -I/usr/include/Motif1.2 -I/usr/include/X11R5

The X_LIBS line is changed to:

X_LIBS = -L/usr/lib/Motif1.2 -lXm -L/usr/lib/X11R5 -L/usr/lib/X11R4 -lXmu \
         -lXt -lX11

	We have a project which will use WWW to deliver a product from ORA to
users who have 'subscribed.'  This will be a free product, but we will need
to collect information from the user-base to be able to generate demographics
which will ultimately pay for the project (we hope.)  (BTW, can't talk about
it, wait for the 'official' announcement.)

	I've made modifications to the NCSA server code to support two features
of the new HTTP protocol spec which will allow us to log who is accessing this
'product.'  I've added support for the 'From:' and 'User_Agent:' fields in
server queries to know who is asking and what they are using to retrieve.

	It has occured to me that there are some decisions a server might make, 
given a very little information regarding the browser the user is using.

	I would like to propose the following format for the 'User_Agent:'
field, and see what people think:

	User_Agent: NAME VERSION CAPABILITIES

	Where the name and version would be defined by the browser maker, 
and the CAPABILITIES would come from a list like:

		TEXT 		(does this really need to be said?)
		INLINE_GIF	(gifs inlined ala mosaic)
		GIF,JPG,PS 	(various graphics)
		GHOSTVIEW
		MOUSE
		AUDIO,VIDEO	(supports audio or videofiles)
		MAIL,NEWS,FTP	(supports these local services)
		FAST		(on an ETHER connection)
		SLOW		(on a SLIP dialup)
		... 		(many possible capabilities to be defined)


	The theory here is that documents can be rewritten 'on the fly' to
reference only those capabilities which the user has at hand.

	Further assume that I have a method of managing documents locally which 
return portions of a document based on capability metrics.

	For example:

	I am a user, using Lynx on a VTxxx.  When I make a request to the 
server, Lynx also sends:

		User_Agent: Lynx 1.06 TEXT MAIL NEWS

since these are the capabilities which Lynx running on my host supports.

	The server then retrieves the following document

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>This is a document</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

#ifdef GRAPHICS

#	ifdef GIF

	<IMG HREF=(some gif file)>

#	elif JPG

	<IMG HREF=(some jpg file)>

#	endif

#else
	There is an inline graphic here which cannot be rendered 
	locally.  It can be retrieved by hand as:

#	ifdef FTP

	ftp://hostname/dir/file

#	elif MAIL

	"/dir/file" from hostname

	by using the the ftp->mail gateway at Hostname with the 
	following commands:
		Get blahblahblahblahblah
#	endif


#endif

</BODY>
</HTML>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	(For the non-developers in the audience, the #-commands are from the
standard Unix C language pre-processor.)

	And makes the proper macro expansion to send the best document
back to meet the requirements of the User_Agent.

	I would get, on the browser end, something which looked like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>This is a document</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
	There is an inline graphic here which cannot be rendered 
	locally.  It can be retrieved by hand as: "/dir/file" from hostname

	by using the the ftp->mail gateway at Hostname with the 
	following commands: Get blahblahblahblahblah
</BODY>
</HTML>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Note that the macro document never leaves the system, only the 
particular rewritten version which answers the needs of the reader.

	Thoughts?  --</rr>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
O'Reilly & Associates would like to solicit comments from the WWW online 
community on the following proposal to include support for 'stylesheets' 
in HTML documents.

	Date:		June 6 1993

	Title:		Stylesheets for HTML

	Author:		Robert Raisch
			Manager, Online Systems
			O'Reilly & Associates

	Abstract:

		Many interesting documents in the WWWeb are now being
		designed to support features or attributes of specific
		browsers/renderers.  While this is not, in itself, a
		bad thing, the optimal state would be one where the
		document carried with it information which allowed 
		browsers to make 'appropriate' decisions which were
		aligned with the intent of the original author.

		This RFC proposes an easily parsable format to deliver
		stylistic information along with Web documents.  While
		the actual format of this information is of little 
		general interest to the Web community, an attempt has 
		been made to support a simple subset of generally useful 
		style HINTS or SUGGESTIONS.  This is not meant to be an 
		exhaustive list and suggestions for improvement would 
		be most welcome.

		In no way should this proposal be considered an attempt
		to stipulate *required* behavior.  The sole purpose of
		the included format is to suggest behavior which will
		allow a browser to render a specific document in a form
		which more closely resembles the document as envisioned
		by it's creator.

	The author is indebted to the Global Network Navigator Project and
	Digital Media and Design Groups of O'Reilly and Associates.

	Please direct comments to the newsgroup, or to 'raisch@ora.com'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:

	The format described is supported in libWStyle, a stylesheet parser
	library which will be released to the WWW developer community, REAL
	SOON NOW.

	This document will be made available through the Web.  Due to 
	the nature of certain discussions on the net, it is published here 
	as a plain text document.  Apologies to Web purists.  </rr>

WWW HTML STYLE GUIDE RECOMMENDATIONS		- Robert Raisch
						  O'Reilly & Associates
						  02 June 1993


Need
----

	There is a need within the WWW to be able to specify rendering
specific information along with the content tagging in a WWW document.
It is not appropriate to use HTML for this purpose, since one of the 
first principles of HTML is to encode objects within a document, not how 
they might be rendered in a particular environment.


Executive Summary -- The Short Form
-----------------------------------

	o	HTML documents would include a LINK STYLE tag which would 
		point to a stylesheet associated with the current
		document.

	o	Stylesheet literate browsers or renderers would use this
		tag to retrieve the actual stylesheet.

	o	Multiple stylesheets could be used per document to include
		stylistic changes.  Once a new stylesheet was loaded it
		would hide, not overwrite, the previous stylesheet.  The
		previous stylesheet would become visible once an empty
		LINK STYLE tag was encountered.

	o	Stylesheets are defined in a easy to parse, compact form
		to minimize the time required to retrieve and interpret
		them.

	o	Styles are suggestions or hints about behavior, not rules.



What we're doing here
---------------------

	This document is an attempt to codify those rendering aspects
which would be most useful in the specification of an HTML object.  This is
not meant to be an exhaustive list of rendering possibilities, nor is it 
a set of "rules set in stone" which must be obeyed.  Rather, this is really 
a set of HINTS or SUGGESTIONS to the renderer which might be used to display 
particular HTML objects in the fashion the author of a document originally 
intended.

	It is suggested that renderers which cannot adhere to some style
specified in this document might make an attempt to remain true to the
spirit of the author's original intent.  (Few renderers short of a true
X-terminal will be able to implement the full set of styles defined here.)

	An example of this might be the use of a 'o' (small-oh) to represent 
the 'round mark', or the interpretation of a color style specifying red on 
white characters as a "reverse video" or "blinking" attribute on terminals 
which do not support color.

	
The Styles
----------

	The styles defined specify the recommended behavior of HTML objects
in terms of:

	Category			Style Name
	-----------------------		----------
	character rendering		font
	object justification		justify
	page layout			column
	break behavior			break
	special marks			mark
	vertical object layout		vert
	horizontal object layout	indent
	links contained in objects	link


	Each style has a number of arguments or attributes which can be
specified per HTML object, and in the general case, as a default for all
HTML objects which are not further refined.


Stylesheet Identification 
-------------------------

	HTML specifies a header element called <LINK> which can be used for a
wide variety of purposes.  I suggest that the following form be followed:

	<LINK STYLE={URL}>

	It is expected that stylesheet literate browsers would retrieve the
stylesheet from it's URL, and use the information contained therein to make
appropriate rendering decisions.  (See Appendix II and III)

APPENDIX II
Stylesheet Layout and Parsing Considerations	--	(TECHNICAL DETAIL)
--------------------------------------------

	An example stylesheet follows the discussion of the various styles,
and details the recommended layout of a stylesheet.

	Each element of the stylesheet is uniquely marked and the name of 
each style and style attribute has been chosen to be unique to the first 
two letters, which makes parsing the style-sheet a simple task.

Parsing Rule #1:

	Lines which do not have as their first non-whitespace character
	either an '@' which signals the beginning of a new object definition 
	or an alphabetic [a-zA-Z], will be ignored to the end of the line.

Parsing Rule #2:

	Next we throw out all the newlines and scan the remaining buffer.
	An '@' (at-sign) signals the beginning of a new HTML object definition.

Parsing Rule #3:
	
	After the '@' and possible intervening whitespace, we expect the name 
	of an HTML object (eg. TITLE, H1, B, STRONG, etc.)

Parsing Rule #4:

	After the name, and intervening whitespace, we expect at least two
	characters which signal the beginning of a style. Legal values are:
		fo, ju, co, br, ma, ve, in, li

Parsing Rule #5:

	After the two character style specifier, scan to the '(' (open-paren)
	and ignore intervening data or whitespace.

... (I think you get the idea, but I'll fill this in later if necessary)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


APPENDIX III
Use of Stylistic Hints or Suggestions - Typical Scenario -- (MUY TECHNICAL!!)
--------------------------------------------------------

	A renderer which understands the <LINK STYLE> tag would use the URL
to retrieve the stylesheet, and run it through the WWW style library,
(libStyle.a -- to be supplied, currently in development.)

	Once the stylesheet has been loaded, when an HTML element is 
encountered within the document, the renderer has the option of calling the
style library, asking for advice on how to render the specific element.

For example:	(scans all styles and renderer sets attributes)

		***Renderer begins to scan document***

		***Renderer recognizes <LINK STYLE={URL}>***

		  loadStyleSheet( {URL});

		***Renderer sees a <TITLE> tag in the document***

		  current = firstStyle( styles = queryStyleSheet( TITLE));

		  while( current) {

		    switch( styleName( current)) {

		      case FONT: {
			while( nextAttr( current)) {

			  switch( attr) {

			    case FAMILY:
			      switch( attrValue(attr)) {

				case TIMES:
					***Renderer decides what to do here***
				case HELVETICA:
				case SYSTEM:
				case TYPEWRITER:
				default:
			      }
			    case SPACING:
			    case SIZE:
			    case WEIGHT:
			    case SLANT:
			    case FOREGROUND:
			    case BACKGROUND:  
			    case LINE:
			    case LONGNAME:
			    default:
			  }
			}
			break;
		      }
		      case JUSTIFY:
			break;
		      case COLUMNS:
			break;
		      case BREAK:
			break;
		      case MARK:
			break;
		      case VERTICAL:
			break;
		      case INDENT:
			break;
		      case LINK:
			break;
		      default:
			***Ignore -- Illegal style***
		    }
		    current = nextStyle( styles);
		  }


Another example:	(renderer sets attributes only for styles needed)

		***Renderer begins to scan document***

		***Renderer recognizes <LINK STYLE={URL}>***

		  loadStyleSheet( {URL});

		***Renderer sees a <TITLE> tag in the document***

			switch( getValue(TITLE, FONT, FAMILY)) {
			*** renderer decides what to do here***
				case UNKNOWN:	
				case TIMES:
				case HELVETICA:
				case SYSTEM:
				case TYPEWRITER:
			}

		***Renderer sees a <H1> tag in the document***

			switch( getValue( H1, BREAK, STYLE)) {
				case UNKNOWN:
				case BEFORE:
				case AFTER:
			}

		  etc.

I don't think that this would be a good way of accomplishing your goals.
The ".multi" extension used to serve documents of varying types would
be a better approach to the problem.   If a link <img src="dinosaur.multi">
was used the client would attempt to retrieve it telling the server
what types it can handle.  In the Lynx case it would say it could handle
".txt" types and could recieve a text description of the image in question.
Xmosaic would respond with ".gif" and ".xbm" types and would receive the
image.  Other browsers may choose to download the picture and use an 
external viewer to show the image and put a text box in to show where
the picture should have appeared.  If an acceptable type is not available
then the client should respond with an appropriate message explaining
the problem, and pointing out that an image should have appeared "here".

I have been meaning to make Lynx image "aware" but have not had the 
time to do so yet.

Subject: Using Mosaic by remote control
X-Md4-Signature: 0c5fd1296b5942283dc9f1dc02726057

Documentation on Mosaic 1.1's remote control functionality is
available now in...

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/remote-control.html

...the text is below.

I'm interested to see how people use this and to get feedback on how
it can be improved.

Thanks,
Marc


Using Mosaic by Remote Control
******************************

NCSA Mosaic (version 1.1 or later) can be operated by remote
control.  This means that an application -- any application --
can directly operate Mosaic, by specifying documents on the
network to view, directing it to open new windows, etc.  

How It Works
============

Mosaic has a signal handler for the "extra", normally unused
signal called SIGUSR1.  When that signal is received by a running
Mosaic process, the signal handler determines its process ID or 
pid (via the getpid() call) and derives a config filename: 

        /tmp/xmosaic.pid

So, for example, if the running Mosaic's pid is 1343, the config
filename is: 

        /tmp/xmosaic.1343

This config file is assumed to contain two lines of text: 

 o The first line is a directive, either goto (which means jump
   right to a document) or newwin (which means open a new
   window and use that window to display a document).  
 o The second line is the URL of the document to download
   and view.  

So, an example config file that tells Mosaic to view document 
file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/ in an already-open window is: 

goto
file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/

(Note that a goto command will cause the document to be viewed in the
most-recently-used document view window, if a Mosaic session has
multiple open windows.)

How To Use It
=============

One way to use this capability is to take advantage of Mosaic's
interaction and display functionality to provide cheap and
low-overhead online, possibly context-sensitive help for other
applications.  The first time help is requested in your application,
fork off a new Mosaic process with a command-line argument
corresponding to the appropriate help document, which can of
course be pulled over the network in real time or retrieved from
the local disk.  Subsequent help requests can use the running
Mosaic process by writing a config file (the Mosaic process ID is
returned from the initial fork() call) and using the kill() call
to send a SIGUSR1.  

Another use is Mosaic as a general hypermedia display engine for
mail readers, news readers, HTML editors, and similar
applications.  For example, we're currently building capabilities
into the Emacs html-mode.el package developed by one of the
Mosaic authors (marca@ncsa.uiuc.edu) to provide transparent
HTML previewing via a single keystroke.  Other people are
putting hooks into existing mail and news handlers.  More
information will be available when it's available.  

Future Possibilities
====================

Have any ideas for future possibilities along these lines?  We're
thinking both in terms of what can be done with this method as
well as more advanced capabilities involving two-way network
communication for the future.  Drop us a line if you have any
interesting thoughts.  

Acknowledgements
================

Thanks much to Ken Evans (evans@phebos.aps.anl.gov) who
suggested the concept and contributed initial code.

Dear Rob,

First a few words on what I am doing ...

I am drafting the DTD for HTML+ which will be the successor to HTML. The
new standard will be largely compatible with HTML but will standardise
features such as embedded images, figures and add new ones such as tables,
and forms. You can look at the current state of the DTD (work in progress)
at "ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/dev/htmlplus.dtd.txt". I hope to finalise
the HTML+ standard this summer, and issue it formally as an RFC.

We would very much like to ensure the new standard meets the needs for a
generic, lightweight, presentation independent delivery format for publishers
and the Internet community at large. Terry Allen, editor of the Digital Media
Group has already been very helpful, and I would like to encourage other
members of O'Reilly & Associates to contribute their views too.

I read your style sheet proposal with great interest, and will add the
"style" attribute to the LINK tag attribute definition in the DTD.

Have you considered allowing multiple stylesheets to cover different uses?
This would mean that you could specify one style for printing and another for
online use. You might want to go further and distinguish between X windows,
PC's and palmtops.

My suggestion is that the LINK element takes another attribute which specifies
the intended media, e.g.

        <LINK style="http://ora.com/styles/paper_a4" media="paper/A4">
        <LINK style="http://ora.com/styles/paper_B5" media="paper/B5">
        <LINK style="http://ora.com/styles/xwindows" media="xwindows">        

Multiple such elements could be included in each HTML+ document.

Note that the media attribute value can encode further parameters - paper
size in the above example. By defining the media attribute as taking a CDATA
value, we can allow for new types of media without needing to change the DTD.

Comments please?

Dave Raggett,

What is the status of the CSO protocol?  Should we

	(a) 	Include it in the libWWW access code to allow all W3
		clients to use it
		
	(b) 	Make a gateway so that the existing 100 CSO
		servers are
		accessible
	
	(c) 	Get someone to write an HTTP server for the CSO
		database so that all CSO servers should be
		upgraded?

There aren'tany I know of over here, someone please fill me in on
CSO history?

As many of you may know, Gopher file type 2 is a CSO nameserver 

interface.  All of the WWW clients that I have seen do not support
this file type.  Why not?

A page similar to the Gopher index page could be displayed,
with some additional instructions on how to construct a query.

For instance:  To search on all fields simply say "query STRING"
	       To search on a particular field like a name field
	       say "query name=STRING"

The client simply has to send an extra "\nquit\n" to complete the
query, or cut off the connection when the string "200:Ok" or
"501:No matches to your query." is sent by the server. 


Considering the fact that there are over 100 CSO servers available
for these queries, doesn't it seem necessary to support them?

Maybe a new url type is in order:
	"cso://cso.univ.edu:105/"

Mosaic 1.1 support CSO servers through Gopher via an addition to
HTGopher.c in the stock libwww; the code was contributed by, let's

It's not that flat.  As a matter of fact I live at the top of a great

Subject: Gopher support in X Mosaic, cosmetic suggestion
Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1993 14:32:51 -0400
From: Edward Vielmetti <emv@garnet.msen.com>

I'd like to make a teeny tiny suggestion as to how Gophers should look
in X Mosaic.

Currently if you connect to a gopher you get a title in the Document Title
part of the screen, but only a "select one of" headline in the main
screen.  This is kind of, well, not terribly attractive.  

Putting the Document Title in the main gopher screen in a nice bold-faced
font would do some good, I think.

If/when "gopher+" appears, there are some other nice things that could
be put in to spruce up the normal gopher menu appearance, e.g. some of
the "g+" attributes map pretty well to the standard parts of the screen
layouts of most web screens.

(Just got mosaic running on BSDI, it's awesome folks - now I want to
go back and re-do some of the mucking around I did with gopher...)

Dave,

I realize this has come up before, but how about really doing something about
equation support? There are lots of documents I would like to put into the
Web, but without support for embedded equations, it's really quite difficult.
Something simple like eqn support would be great. And eqn shouldn't be all
that hard to parse either.....

Thanks, Torben

P.S. What would be particularly nice is to be able to use anchors to jump to
other equations....

Subject: CR not stripped properly on FTP transfers
Cc: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch

OK, I think I see the problem.

1)  HTFTP.c always uses ASCII mode FTP transfers.

2)  In ASCII mode transfers of UNIX source documents, most UNIX ftp
servers always put a CR before every LF.

[Note:  It's not clear under what conditions this *should* be done (On
UNIX, every file is in some sense a binary file, interpretable only by
an "understanding" program.  On other system, say VMS, the notion of
"line" is in the file system for line-oriented files, and VMS FTP
servers might choose, for non-line-oriented files being transmitted in
ASCII mode, not to put CR before every line feed, but just at the end of
every block, or not at all (after all, no "lines").).  The RFC for FTP
says:

>         3.1.1.1.  ASCII TYPE

>             This is the default type and must be accepted by all FTP
>             implementations.  It is intended primarily for the transfer
>             of text files, except when both hosts would find the EBCDIC
>             type more convenient.

>             The sender converts the data from an internal character
>             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII
>             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver
>             will convert the data from the standard form to his own
>             internal form.

>             In accordance with the NVT standard, the <CRLF> sequence
>             should be used where necessary to denote the end of a line
>             of text.  (See the discussion of file structure at the end
>             of the Section on Data Representation and Storage.)

Since HTFTP never seems to transmit the STRU command, we assume that the
file is transferred with structure "file-structure", which means,
according to the RFC, that

>          3.1.2.1.  FILE STRUCTURE

>             File structure is the default to be assumed if the STRUcture
>             command has not been used.

>             In file-structure there is no internal structure and the
>             file is considered to be a continuous sequence of data
>             bytes.

The TELNET RFC (which I believe is still 854; does something later
obsolete it?) says about CR and LF,

>       Therefore, the sequence "CR LF" must be treated as a single "new
>       line" character and used whenever their combined action is
>       intended; the sequence "CR NUL" must be used where a carriage
>       return alone is actually desired; and the CR character must be
      avoided in other contexts.

So my reading would be that for UNIX files being transmitted with mode =
"ASCII" and structure = "file-structure", the sender would have to put a
NUL character after every CR, and should *not* put a CR in front of any
LF, since there really are no "lines of text" in the UNIX file system.

This is probably why I'm not a net.wizard.

end Note]

3)  WWW should then change CR-LF pairs to simple LF, but there is no
routine which does this (HTCopyNoCR discards *all* CR's, which is OK for
text documents (usually), but not for binary documents like tar files). 
There's also no easy way in HTFormat.c to "think" about this, because
it's a characteristic of the input stream, not of the input format
(which is something more like "www/mime").

4)  Because of this, "binary" documents are copied to the output with
HTCopy, which does not strip any characters, even the ones which
*should* be stripped.

So the problem is that the actions of the FTP protocol are not being
reversed anywhere.  This particular trait is a characteristic of the
transfer protocol being used, not of the document's input format or of
the transfer-encoding.  Seems like the right thing to do is to remove
the simple file_number model used in HTFormat.c, and replace it with an
input stream, which could then be specialized as necessary to remove the
actions of the transfer protocol, if necessary.  Another possibility
would be to always use BINARY mode transfers in the FTP module (since
that's what HTFormat.c seems to expect), and add CR if necessary in the
WWW library.  Perhaps both of these should be implemented.

One of the changes I made to libwww version 1 (well, 0.9-something)
for Mosaic was exactly that.

Yes, changing HTFTP to use image mode for transfers seems to work well. 
Now tar file transfers work OK with -source.

But note that this quick (and dirty) fix has its own problems.  In
particular, if I fetch a text file from a Mac FTP server (or any ftp
server that doesn't use LF in its new-line string), the file will
contain CR where there should be LF.  It's a shame we don't have two
different URL schemes for FTP:  one (say binaryftp:foo) would be for
binary documents, and the other (say, textftp:foo) would be for text
documents.

Here's my version of HTFTP.c/HTFTPLoad() [note that it also has patches
for our Internet gateway scheme, please ignore them]:

/*	Retrieve File from Server

Seems to me people are addressing the wrong end of the pipe with regard to
gopher support. XMosaic shouldn't have to do anything in particular with
gopher info. Shouldn't it really be up to the HTTP server (or gateway) to
present gopher information in a more palatable form? It's a very minor
change to NCSA's HTTP server to get it to put out nice looking gopher
listings with in-lined images, etc. for example.

To do this, all you have to do is modify a few of the fprintf lines in the
spew_and_free_array subroutine inside http_gopher.c.

Huh?  As far as I know there is no gateway involved when www clients
like XMosaic access Gopher servers: support for the Gopher protocol is
built in the client.  (There may be a gateway in existence
nevertheless, but it must be intended only for access through clients
that don't know the Gopher protocol yet.)

  OVERVIEW OF GOPHER SUPPORT
  --------------------------
 
      As of beta release .3, this server will automatically generate
  HTML listings of a gopher directory without going through gopherd.
  This means that . files which are links are processed, and .cap files
  are processed. Any request which begins with /gopher-data will be
  considered a gopher request if gopher is turned on. Therefore, mapping
  /gopher-data to the location of your server's data will allow you to
  access /gopher-data and get a gopher listing in return.

Hmmmm.... I would rather carry this information in the stylesheet itself. 
I seems rather wasteful to me to have 5 or 6 media links in the same
document.

I would suggest though that this is not of general use.  The stylesheet,
as proposed is really a collection of hints or suggestions for the
renderer to make decisions to best represent the content of a document in
a style which most meets the original intent of the author.

As such, there are general regions of responsibility which I feel we can
suggest complience with, (fonts, indents, etc.), and other more specific
areas which quickly become "a maze of twisty little suggestions, all alike."
I do not think that we really need nor want to specify this to the level
of the actual media used to realize the document.

I believe that it is up to the individual renderer to make the "proper
decisions" regarding the differences in printing in phosphors or ink, and
how a document looks on different page sizes.

Comments?  Am I off base here?

This is fine; I hadn't been thinking of dumb character terminals.
A minor point: there has to be some mechanism
for dealing with marginal notes that overlap:  you could have
two footnotes on the same line, or two long marginal notes
only a few lines apart.

I liked the form example, and intend to try it out.

Very interesting.  I'm using the "gn" gopher server here; is there a
similar server already built to handle its "menu" files?  (If not, 
hm, should be easy enough to build...)

Yup, should be pretty easy -- the other Gopher stuff in the NCSA
server was done by a skilled undergrad in a couple of days.
(Unfortunately, he's off writing 3DO software for the summer...
traitor.)

We are planning on putting Gopher visual type indication right in
Mosaic; the bitmaps will be built into the source code so the
performance hit should be negligible and, as was pointed out, they
will be present when talking directly to Gopher servers (by far the
most popular way to tie into Gopher directory hierarchies).

You are right.  Actually tabs are mentioned in the PRE part, but
nowhere else.   The general understanding (before Mosaic) was that

	- Multiple spaces should be respected as such (for example
	  some people like them around punctuation) and should not
	  be used for prettying up the source.
	  

	- Tabs should not be used outside PRE

	- Within PRE, tabs are normal unix
		(>0 spaces to multiple of 8)

I would like to specify that multiple spaces be interpreted as such.
Would this be a big problem for anyone?
  

  There are a number of documents on the net which look very weird  
with non-mosaic browsers -- when I come across a bad one, I  
occasionally mail the author.

In a year's time I expect much more HTML to be generated from wysiwyg  
editors, and so the question of eth readability of the source won't
be relevant.

Of course, you can put in all the source pretty formatting you like
but if you once touch it with a wysiwyg editor, you'll probably lose  
it all anyway.

There is in the hypertext document (and in the draft internet draft)
a "typical rendering" defined for each of these elements.  Browsers
are not obliged to use this rendering. In the case of Mosaic, as far
as I can see, nothing is ever justified other than left-justfied.
That may be just the desiner's choice or a constraint of the  
implementation.  It doesn't make them an invalid W3 browser, just
not a typical one.  (Even though there may be -- untill Cello gets
seriouslsy deployed -- more XMosaics than anything other W3 clients)

The ideal would be to make the styles user-configurable, with the
"typical rendering" and the designer's personal favorites
as an options.

Well both of these will be possible with the HTML+ DTD, by using the capability
to embed foreign formats inline in the HTML+ source, e.g.

        <H2>A example of an equation</H2>

        <EMBED TYPE="text/eqn">zeta (s) ~=~ sum from k=1 to inf
         k sup -s ~~~ (Re s &gt; 1) </EMBED>

The browser identifies the format of the embedded data from the "type"
attribute, specified as a MIME content type. Certain characters need to
be escaped using entity definitions, e.g. ">" by "&gt;" in the example.

Building in support for a range of formats has the danger of leading to
very large programs for browsers. This could be avoided by using a common
API for rendering foreign formats, e.g. as functions that take a sequence
of bytes and return a pixmap.

Browsers can then be upgraded to display new formats without changing their
code at all. All you would need is a way of binding the MIME content type
to the function name for that format, e.g. via X resources or a config file.
The functions could be implemented as separate programs driven via pipes and
stdin/stdout or as dynamically linked library modules (Windows DLLs).

How does that sound?

The general understanding before Mosaic??  The general understanding
we were under was that redundant spaces, newlines, tabs, etc. were not
significant, and that's the way Mosaic treats 'em.  The concept that
multiple spaces should be respected as such is new to me -- where in
the online info was this stated?

> I would like to specify that multiple spaces be interpreted as such.

Isn't it a violation of the SGML philosophy that we've all spent so
much blood, sweat, and tears trying to adhere to?

If we're going to start down this path, I'd like to see a line
containing nothing but whitespace to be considered an implicit
paragraph separator (<p>), as in LaTeX.

It was a choice, made at least partially because documents can be
wider than the available window space, causing a horizontal scrollbar
to show up and info on the right side of the document to be hidden until
the window is scrolled.  Didn't seem reasonable that information
should be shoved over where one might not even be able to see it.

Agreed.

This doesn't sound right to me. Like Mosaic, I too, treat whitespace
as separators, and ignore how many spaces, carriage returns, newlines
or tabs there are.

Showing more space after punctuation is a rendering issue and should
be left to the reader's preference.

	There are currently around 75 registered HTTP hosts.
	When I last looked there were 113 WAIS hosts registered.
	
	You might find the graph of NSF backbone usage interesting.
	(appended).  FTP data is much bigger than any of these.
	
	Note that the chart shows HTTP protocol traffic (on
	port 80 only).  W3 clients talk
	all the protocols shown.  Some of the Gopher (and FTP)
	traffic is from W3 clients such as Mosaic. Difficult
	to know how much.

WAIS *declines* in usage, both relatively and absolutely; WWW grows
drmatically, from .066% of packets to .143%.  Gopher keeps growing
too, of course.

My guess is that Gopher and WWW front ends are masking some WAIS  
usage.
But users are probably choosing browsing over WAIS searches as well.

Wouldn't it make more sense to go by bytes rather than packets, as a
more accurate reflection of how much data is actually being shipped
across?

Just curious,

As a general attitude to spacing, I still think that Knuth got it
right with TeX [TeXbook, p.46]: by default newlines, tabs and spaces
are treated as equivalent, multiple spaces are collapsed, spaces and
tabs at the starts of lines are ignored, and extra space after
punctuation is handled separately.  (TeX is a typesetter, and spacing
punctuation in one-space units would be too coarse.)  Knuth's thinking
was that if you can't see the difference on the screen then it should
not make a difference to the final output.

On the other hand, there are two reasons not to adopt Knuth's
conventions verbatim: first, your hands are likely tied by SGML
compatibility; second, you are working in a fairly clunky character
medium rather than fine typesetting.  If the spacing is done in units
of a normal inter-word space, then indicating a double-wdith space
with two space characters *is* an expedient convention.  (Especially
as HTML has no way of distinguishing an end-of-sentence full stop from
an abbreviation-indicating fill stop.)

That said, being able to rigidly indent the text of a document with
markup can greatly improve its legibility -- with TeX documents I
indent the text one tab stop, leaving the macros that generate
headings and delimit regions of text in column 0.  This makes the
structure of the document easier to follow.  (It also prevents UNIX
sendmail from inserting ">" characters before "From".)  The same
applies to HTML documents, excapt that if the text is indented, only
Mosaic can display them properly.

You could specify that any number of whitespace characters (SP, HT,
LF, CR) may follow the CR or LF marking the end of a line, and they're
all ignored (except in PRE elements, of course).  This would mean that
indentation of text lines is ignored, as well as any blank lines (even
ones with spaces on them).  Doubled spaces after sentences would be
preserved.  This should be easy to implement, and allows people like
me to format their text pretty much as they would like.

sendmail from inserting ">" characters before "From".)  The same
applies to HTML documents, excapt that if the text is indented, only
Mosaic can display them properly.

You could specify that any number of whitespace characters (SP, HT,
LF, CR) may follow the CR or LF marking the end of a line, and they're
all ignored (except in PRE elements, of course).  This would mean that
indentation of text lines is ignored, as well as any blank lines (even
ones with spaces on them).  Doubled spaces after sentences would be
preserved.  This should be easy to implement, and allows people like
me to format their text pretty much as they would like.

There was obviously a general MISunderstanding!  My fault, should
have got it clearer at the time. This was when Dan Connolly was
our "SGML cop". As I remember, his conclusion was that multiple
spaces were weird things to put in, but if someone wanted to put
them in, then they should be given more space as a result.

>> I would like to specify that multiple spaces be interpreted as  
such.

It seems to be a problem for Mosaic and for Dave.

I don't think so... SGML allows you to define the significance of the
data.  I know the IBM mainframe SGML implementation here took two
spaces as two spaces.

I see your argument.  Newlines led to a horrible discussion about

They can be wider... but Misaic is normally very clever at
sizing them to the screen size.  Its only preformatted bits which  
force a wide document.  It would be useful if the default  
preformatted font was chosen such that 80 characters fitted within
the default window width.  As it is one normally starts Mosaic
and then has to stretch it the moment a plain ascii document comes  
up.

Dan's remark on www-talk on 8 Jan 93 was:
"Is anyone distressed by the situation where some browsers compress
multiple spaces [in typeset paragraphs] into one, and some do not?  
I'm not.
I'd say "Don't do that" to the fool who put multiple spaces in
his source."

Well, I'm not too fussy about this, but an agreement is essential.
I can change the behaviour of the parser in the library if  we
all agree.

PROPOSED CHANGE then:

All white space to be shrunk to one space outside PRE
sections.   Anyone object?

I object to collapsing spaces everywhere outside of PRE.
I agree that coding multiple spaces is not a wise thing
to do, but I must believe that lacking better solutions,
we need spaces.  Where this has caused us problems in
Xmosaic is in documents that have an inline image followed
on the same line by text.  There's no good way to get proper
spacing between the image and the first character.
We have introduced some bad coding to get around the lack
of horizontal spacing, and I don't like that approach.

I forget the HTML tag used for Program Listings, whether we
use CODE or EXAMPLE, but this is another case where spaces
are significant.

...is out. To pick it up, download cello.zip from the /pub/LII/Cello
directory on fatty.law.cornell.edu.  The previous version is in
/pub/LII/Cello/beta01, though why anyone would care is an open question.

The .2 version repairs the following problems:

1) Improper handling of <PRE> documents, reported by Alert Cellist Lou Montulli.
2) Improper handling of situations where telnet hosts would stack
inverse video attributes on top of bold, blink, etc (though why anyone
would do this I don't know).
3) A few miscellaneous memory-handling problems, including a tendency
to hang when telnetting to AIX hosts.
4) Inability to use anything other than a local DOS file as a home
page, reported by Alert Cellist Michael Mealling.
5) Assorted errors and omissions in the Help application, including
specific information encouraging the use of NDIS drivers with ATT StarLan.

It adds the following features:

1) Ability to access a resource directly by typing in the URL (thanks
to Alert Cellist and All-Round WWW Guy TimBL).
2) See 4) above.

Subject: Spaces outside PRE

I differ from Dale on this: extra white space should be 
collapsed outside of PRE.  A sentence  that    happens to be  typed this
way shouldn't be formatted differently than one that is spaced normally.
The reason is that you then have to pay excruciating attention to these
spaces. 
        
I do notice that there seems to be no way to get white space when you
want it in xmosaic, so there needs to be some provision for that.  But
double spaces are not the way.  
        
Tabs are also another matter.  Perhaps their effectiveness should be 
restricted to a tabbing environment.  Some examples from the group of
how people would like to use tabs outside of PRE would be helpful to
this discussion.

Well, it may be the best that we're going to get. However, I still feel that
equations are too basic to not be supported directly. Note that the more
successful text processing systems (and that's part of what this will have to
be) all support text, equations and tables nicely.

I can't comment on the degree of overhead involved in having multiple media
links in the same document, but specifying a style sheet for xwindows or a
random palmtop or whatever seems extremely useful.  Those of us in the MOO
community and the educational community have a body of people used to a
particular style of interfaces, and this sort of style sheet support would
make it much easier for us to integrate tools like Mosaic into our existing
environments.

Subject: Re: SPaces and Tabs in HTML documents

I believe the proper thing to do is to have a way of specifying horizontal
whitespace as well as settings for tabs specified in units (inches,
centimeters, and points at a minimum). Support for right justification is
important, especially to support text that reads right to left such as
arabic, hebrew and kanji. Full justification would be nice, but is
complicated. The ability for an author to specify a recommended style sheet
per document, defining typefaces, point sizes, tab settings, etc. would be
beneficial.

Monospaced typefaces such as Courier are not commonly used to view
documents outside of DOS, character based terminals and shell windows. In
graphical environments and printing, the width of a "space" or
uninterpreted "tab" will vary widely depending on typeface (Times,
Helvetica, etc.), type size, "style" (bold, italics, etc.), so documents
created today that make assumptions about whitespace by using "space"
characters are going to look real bad tomorrow. Just look at the
progression of documents on the Mac, Windows and Unix as people figured
that out, not to mention proper use of double quotes, capitalization, and
other grammar and punctuation (See Robin Wiliams "The Mac is not a
typewriter" or "The PC is not a typewriter" at your local bookstore).
Scalable font technology (ATM and Truetype), fractional spacing support in
applications, kerning between characters and words, etc. can all change the
look of a document, particularly one relying on the use of spaces for
whitespace. Also, keep in mind that display resolutions and actual dots per
inch (dpi) of monitors varies and higher dpi monitors are becoming more
common (120 dpi has been available for a while).

There is no reason to assume 80 characters per line either.

Yes, that sounds good.  My favorite way to handle this is to have the
browser create and manage an X sub-window over the area where the inset
is to be displayed, and pass the window ID of the sub-window to the
subprogram which understands the inset format, with the understanding
that that program is to handle all events and refresh on the sub-window,
but the browser gets to handle configuration and window movement.

I disagree. White space should be "transparent" because it doesn't mean the
same thing from display to display. What is an 8 character wide tab on a
VT100 turns into some arbitrary chunk of white space on other displays.
What is really needed is some sort of marker like <indent> or <space> with
arguments in some universal unit.

This brings up another white space, namely the question of line ends in
<pre> blocks. What IS the "legal" end of line terminator in HTML? CR/LF? LF
only? Many documents with <pre> sections look great on one client and
horrible on others because of the inconsistent treatment of end of line
characters.

"Proper spacing" is purely a function of the presentation tool, not of
the document.

You must be thinking of some other markup format.  HTML+ should not
support *any* of this.  It's supposed to support *generic*, *meaningful*
markup, not procedural typographic junk.

Your response is dead wrong.  I must have some way of indicating
to the application where I want white space, or I do not have
sufficient control over the formatting of my documents.  How
the browser *handles* my request for white space is a 
presentational issue.  But white space in general is *not*
purely presentational.  This is all the more important because
of the limited range of markup possible in so generalized a
system as HTML.

Sorry, you're not supposed to have control over the formatting of your
documents, in the sense that I think you mean.  (I may be
misinterpreting your meaning; could you say a bit more about why
"whitespace in general is *not* purely presentational"?)  There are
plenty of formats that support that kind of thing; there's no need to
turn HTML into yet-another-bastardized-procedural-markup format.

I think it's pretty clear, though, that there's a lot of desire for
browsers like XMosaic to support both HTML and one or more additional
procedural formats, such as TeX or MS-Word.

Quick example:

This sentence uses white space to separate words.

Thissentenceuseswhitespacetoseparatewords.

Unless you tag every word, that white space has meaning.  It is
not purely presentational.  

Similarly with other uses of white space:  if one represented by
tagging everything white space can be used for, you wouldn't 
need it.  But in a small tag set such as HTML, you can't get
along without it.  Even in a large SGML DTD provision is not
made for all the things one might use white space for,
meaningfully.

That would fit into the $1,000,000+ feature request category.  :-)

Folks:

I had hoped to stay right out of this one, but I think perhaps a dash
of practicality is in order.  One for which I will probably be
electronically lynched, but such are the risks.

The current debate over whitespace is a glaring example of the sort of
thing which has disadvantaged HTML vis a vis rougher (and readier)
non-standards like Gopher from the beginning.  I have been on the
stump for WWW a good bit lately amongst law schools, many of whom are
looking at putting up some kind of server capability for the first
time, and for whom _any_ move toward new technology is done at the
expense of a primary mission of low-level support for faculty and
student activity.  These people are not exactly grabbing pitons and
running out to look for a learning curve to scale, and there is a
general perception that hypertext is hard, it's much easier just to
dump an unformatted file into Gopher and it's almost as good.  I
happen not to agree with this, and am devoting a certain amount of
time and effort to weaning them from this attitude.  But say SGML in
anything above a soothing whisper and they run from the room.

I sure hope that none of them took my proselytizing at a conference in
Chicago last week seriously enough to subscribe to www-talk in 
some hope of finding out what the Web is about.  I suspect they would
be a mite bewildered by the religious warfare amongst the Ayatollahs
of Em Space.

I agree that bastardizing standards is a rotten idea and in
the long run complicates implementors' lives a little, maybe.  Just
maybe. But something as inherently counterintuitive as taking all
control over whitespace away from an author -- or allowing them to
retain it by creating a tagset the size of the Manhattan phone book --
sure isn't going to put a lot of docs on the Web very quickly,
whatever it may do for the purity of the standard.

Uncharacteristically difficult tonight,
Tb.

How about having two <PRE> style tags.  One works just like existing <PRE>
and another tag that (probably) doesn't use the fixed-width font but does
preserves spaces and tabs as much as possible and allows full HTML mark-up.
It will be the task of the browser to make this look good.  This way you
can write freestyle HTML or where needed switch into pseudo-fixed-width
mode (<PFW>? :-).  This was we can keep the freestyle input of HTML
which I much prefer, but still allow a back-door for those cases
that require special spacing but don't really need pure fixed-width.
Think of it as three levels of control:
    1) spaces mean nothing (default)
    2) spaces mean something
    3) fully preformatted text, don't mess with it

One other thing I would like to note is that <PRE> tends to imply computer
generated text that you *want* to be in a courier like font.  <PFW> would
imply that it's pre-formated at some level (which I'll leave open for
debate) but it's generally not something that wants a courier type font.
Perhaps we need one more level (2.5) that is for fully preformatted text
(just like <PRE>) but that you probably don't want a courier font for it
either.  In reality we'll probably have options to PRE, like TYPE="spaces",
TYPE="spaces/indent", with TYPE="preforamtted" being the default.

This isn't a fully developed idea, I just wanted to toss it out for
consideration as an option.

As a side note (just to generate some controversy more interesting
than spaces and tabs).

Let's keep in mind that while pure generalized markup is a good thing,
HTML is ultimately a presentation format.  HTML is not, should not, and
can not be the DTD to end all DTD's so if we want to be able to represent
a wide variety of formats in HTML we are going to have to give *some*
level of control to the author in some cases.  Emphasis is a good example
of this.  HTML simply cannot include semantic tags for every frickin'
thing you can think of.  At some point you fall back to something like
italic/bold (or <EM>/<STRONG> or whatever).  The <PRE> tag itself
is a major back-door to allow all kinds of author specified layout.

Clearly we want generalized markup as much as possible, but for a
presentation format we need some basics to fall back on or we are just
shooting ourselves in the foot.  SGML bigots are missing the big picture,
99.999% of the existing data *doesn't have* semantic information and no
one gives a shaving cream about it; we just want it online and some of us
would like to access it via hypertext.  Man pages are a good example of
this (you can hypertext the references to other man pages, but you can't
put semantic tags back where there is only bold and italic text).  Also,
since you pretty much have to process already formated man pages the layout
is fixed (this is where <PRE> comes in handy).

Subject: "home pages for newsgroups" project
Date: Tue, 15 Jun 1993 00:49:36 -0400
From: Edward Vielmetti <emv@garnet.msen.com>

I'm looking for a collaborator in a project to build "home pages"
for a bunch of Usenet newsgroups.


Many netnews groups have archives, special collections, or associated
gopher, wais, or world wide web servers that go along with them.
Current network information about these resources is scattered hither
and yon, in FAQ files, in archie, in wais, etc. etc.  If you don't
know what you are looking for it can be mighty tricky to find it,
and in many cases its more work than it should be.

I'd like to propose a standard "home page" format (probably a DTD, eh?)
for a newsgroup.  At the very minimum this could be automatically
generated from the great big lists of newsgroups.  With more work
it would systematically and regularly collect information about
groups, so that readers coming on new could get up to speed fast,
or so that long-suffering netheads could help guide new people to
the "right" group.

I've put together a tagged file format for a newsgroup description.
It's not HTML (not presentation oriented) but it should be straightforward
to munch on it to turn it into HTML.  I'll send copies to anyone
who is willing to send back a similarly tagged version of their
favorite group.  

thanks

the issue of "how do we treat spaces" in html is a symptom of another
problem with the way development is starting to go.

if you are an SGML purist, you are going to mark up your document
in a format that's semantically correct (chapters are chapters,
paragraphs are paragraphs, and that blob of white space is a
carefully constructed signifier of an emphatic   pause).

you then take your SGML document and transmute it into another SGML
document, one with a simpler format and more concrete representation.
in the World Wide Web you make the decision that <chapter> means
<h1>, text inside <sidenote> should be marked as such to show up as
you want it on screen, etc etc.

lots of people are going to do lots of browsers.  you have to pick
which one you expect things to look "best" in and work to that.  you
may want to generate text for paper, in which case your original markup
may get transmuted into a different format for the paper layout.

the "transmute" step is one people seem to be missing.  i would like
to see more tools thought through that generate HTML as an output
of another process which starts with a richer document model.

Sorry but I'm not voluntering :-). However, it has often struck me,
as a I pull back a few thousand newsgroups, that constructs such as
<a name=news href=news:*>Usenet News</a> might sensibley look for 
a .newsrc in ~ and only pull back subscribed groups. I guess this is
something for the NCSA crew.

Three cheers. :-0 :-0 :-0

It seems fairly clear to me that HTML's beauty is as a publication
protocol; but the top-level source of a document should <em>NOT</em>
use it. I compose documents in terms of semantics (i.e. "top-level
heading") not "big font, carriage return at the end"), and I feel quite
strongly that not only can I do without control over the formatting of
my documents, I actively don't want it.

Cranfield has an house style for paper documents designed by experts,
but it's not used much because each author must lay a document out by
hand, or pay a secretary to do so. Ideally, authors should be able to
produce a high level description in their favourite authoring tool, and
then translate to whatever formats are needed: a paper (e.g.
PostScript) copy in the "house style"; HTML which browsers can display
according to the (human) reader's preferences (which may be quite
unexpected for, say, a partially sighted user); entries for a
bibliographic database, and so on.

An interesting point occurs to me. Voice simulation for the blind is
becoming more and more sophisicated. It can't been too long before
spoken hypertext is available. Anyone considered how HTML might cope
with that? I suggest that only semantic markup will be of much use....

My fault ... firstly, the latest (still months old an buggy) wasn't  
there, secondly what was there wasn't stippred so it was rather big,
and thirdly it wasn't in a sensible place.

It is now /pub/www/bin/next/WorldWideWeb_0.16.tar.Z

There have been a few requests for this, if yours was one
please consider this a reply!

Remember to use

	dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost your.news.host

to set up the news host.
	
This is NOT an up-to-date browser --- it doesn't use the libwww  
library.
It has no Gopher or FTP access and has lots of bugs.  Our
priority list doesn't allow us to upgrade it.

If someone is interested in taking over the NextStep editor, then
we could talk about it.

I think the various points of view have been well represented on
this issue, and fairly economically, too.  Let me make a practical
proposal:  I think I would be satisfied with a single white space
character (or entity), something like Tex's \quad, that is, an en
in the current font.  Is this something we can all accept as needed
even if some see it as impure SGML?

Huh?  Where do you get this?  I thought it was a format for writing down
information.

I'm not arguing that authors shouldn't have control over the
presentation of their material, merely that they shouldn't have this
control *in HTML*.  There are plenty of markup formats which allow this
kind of thing; there's no need to add it to HTML.  There's also no
reason docs "on the Web" have to be in HTML -- if there's a better
format, use it!  This allows us to avoid the "rotten idea".

Where did you get this? HTML is a very poor format for presentation.

If you want to specify presentation for a tool like xmosaic you need
something as powerful as tex or latex. HTML will never be capable of
that flexibility. HTML is only reasonable if the presentation client
decides how to actually format the document.

dave:

thanks for your reply. it was very helpful.  i have a couple of comments.

first, i mentioned that we are planning to use something like:
      <link rev=made href="mailto:...whatever..." >
to allow info providers to provide a path for readers (through their
clients) to contact them with comments.  note that this is a (static) "link"
rather than an (executable link, or) anchor, whereas your MSG tag is an
"executable" link.  lynx will support a command that will search out 
the static info and open a mail screen for the user with the address already
in place.  (actually, lynx already supports such a command when displaying
files in its native hypertext format, and we have found this so useful
that we feel we must duplicate it as we convert our documents to html
this summer.) so, even though MSG is a better solution, we can't wait.

also with respect to the markup of tables, it seems to me that it would be
useful to allow more explicit control over display of the headers, separately
from the body of the table.  that is, i might want to set up headers
that are not centered, but rather left- or right-justified. 

for example, suppose you want to mark up this table:

            average         maximum
          height in         weight in
              yards         metric tons

 males       1.9               .003
 females     1.7               .002


you could allow complete control over the header format by allowing
a second cols attribute applicable to only the headers, or, if you
didn't want to allow complete control you could just add
a placement attribute to specify center, left, or right justification,
giving a <dl> structure that would look something like:

   <dl cols="C7N1.1N0.3">
      <dthd>                       <! null column header >
      <ddhd right> average         <!-- first header line -->
      <ddhd left> maximum
      <dthd>                     <! null column header >
      <ddhd right> height in         <!-- second header line -->
      <ddhd left> weight in 
      <dthd>                       <!third header line>
      <ddhd right> yards
      <ddhd left> metric tons
  <dt>males <dd> 1.9 <dd> .003
  <dt>females <dd> 1.7 <dd> .002


the renderer would set up the right justified 
headers so that the longest header was centered over the data,
and the shorter headers were right justified with the longest one.

further, i suspect the renderer would center over the displayed
data rather than with respect to the designated columns.  the column
sizing is a matter of a maximum width, and may not even be close to
the width of the bulk of the data to be displayed. in this regard
the "cols" attribute may be more like a "datatype" than a format.
on the other hand, this would require an initial inspection pass.

>ISSUE: Is it a bad idea to overload definition lists for tables?

i think it would be easier for beginning users to have two separate
constructs, one for description lists and one for tables.  i know that
users building description lists could simply ignore the extra features
(if their teachers and the documentation they read can resist trying 
to tell them about all the extras!), but all users marking up tables 
would have to deal with the description list mnemonics.  if you
develop a <table> tag, you could get away from the dt and dd distinction
(if you so choose) or at least use something with better mnemonic
value for the user thinking s/he is marking up a table (or relation) rather
than a "description list".  

the first element of a table is (strictly speaking) no different from
the others (a table is simply a set of tuples) and, since
some tables have line-label information on the right and may even
have it in some other column or not at all, calling the first column 
a "description term" may actually confuse the user.  i suppose that you 
will still have to have a different tag to mark the start 
of a new record, of course, so you would end up with a <table> structure
looking something like: 

  <table cols="C5N6.2EL20">      <!-- just an example datatype-->
  <ch center|left|right s=n> text <h c|l|r s=n> text  <h c|l|r s=n> . . .
  <ch c|l|r s=n> text <h c|l|r s=n> text <h c|l|r s=n> . . .

       . . .

  <row>  data    <comma>  data    <comma> . . .
  <row>  data    <comma>  data    <comma> . . .

       . . .

  </table>

here again, some kind of style attribute might be useful, by the way.
and yes, that is one of those "comma" delimited lists you have heard
about.  i couldn't think of anything more mnemonic.

From: "stuff available list" available on request--just ask for it! <rgardner@charon.mit.edu>

So you wanted to know about "stuff available"?
Or maybe I just decided you should get this.

Here's a list of some things.  You can get some
of this stuff once by asking.  You can get on a
mailing list for updates, additions, future stuff,
etc, by asking.  That's two things.  One is just
asking for some stuff.  Two is asking to get on one
of my mailing lists for stuff.  Ok, get ready!
Here's information about some "stuff":

1) art stuff, for instance, the Electronic Art &
Culture Postcard.  I send this out about once a
month to my EAACP mailing list.  You can get it once
by asking, and regularly by asking to get on my
mailing list for it.  There's more art stuff,
but you have to ask.

2) PC software/databases.  I compile databases and
wrap them in software.  Information about an ftp
site, and how to get copies from that site, are
available on request.

3) The Friedrichshof Chronicles.  This is a sort of
net.literature project of mine.  It is some writing
done while living on an artists commune some years
ago.  Contains "adult" material.  You have to very
explicitely ask for a sample of this.  Then you have
to very explicitely ask to get on the mailing list
for future chapters.  The Friedrichshof and
Cambridge Chronicles are also available on an anony-
mous ftp site--so you can read them anonymously.  I
will send you just ftp instructions if you ask.

4) The Cambridge Chronicles.  Like a diary.  Like
The Friedrichshof Chronicles, but written here in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, location of two of the
world's most opinionated zip codes.  You gotta ask.

5) net stuff.  I find net related stuff on the
Internet and save it.  Do you know about Gilder,
superdistribution, etc?  No?  Need I say more?

6) essays.  I write essays from time to time.
No telling what the next one will be about.  Ask
to get on my essay mailing list and you will get
a copy of each one as it comes off the assembly
line in my brain.

7) buzz.  A file of stuff written by me to people
or lists on the net.  So I'm an egomaniac and think
every word from my mouth is important!  So you don't
have to ask for it!  And I won't send it!  Phhhhttt!

8) books.  Some books "written and/or compiled"
by me.  Some very peculiar stuff.  Some inventions.
Some concepts--emphasis on the CON, as I tell people.

Please feel free to copy this file and send it to
anyone (but not a mailing list or news group, please)
you think might be interested.

If you are interested in any of the things on this
list, then send me mail and ask for something.  If
you are suspicious, and wonder just who the heck I
am, then you can try the finger command:

     finger rgardner@charon.mit.edu

Otherwise, send your email requests to:

     rgardner@charon.mit.edu

	I am sceptical.   The significance of HT (the character)
	in PRE (the element) is to go to the "next" tab stop
	after the current position.
	If you don't know the relative font sizes, you can't predict
	where you will be, and so what the next stop will be.
	Any tabbing arrangement which allows variable width
	characters must therefore change the significance to
	"go to the left most tab stop you haven't used so far"
	and wrap the text when it reaches a tab stop by itself.
	Now we have tables.  And when we have tables, we will need
	lines in them of various types, and column headings and
	things.  And it will be good but it won't be tabs.

In fact, the load on an HTTP server machine is very slight,
because the process only runs as long as it takes to return
the document. The info.cern.ch server which has the Subject
Catalogue gets probably a relatively high usage, about
10k requests a day, or (thinks...) one every 9 seconds.
the CPU load is negligible.  In fact of course the peak rate
is higher, but still its not really a factor.

So I would recommend that you chose the platform as one
which has good *reliability*, one which your operators will
know how to back up and handle in an emergency, one with
good connectivity  (like ability to mount appleshare and
Novell stuff might be useful).

A greater load than the httpd server will occur if
you allow telnet sessions to www or lynx, of course.
If you allow people to telnet in and select XMosaic
to their Xterminal, then you'd better get something
really beefy!

Remember to allow lots of disk room for logs.

Also note that httpd appears to be somewhat memory-hungry.  On my
DECstation 5000, running Ultrix, it used 8M to serve ONE PAGE.  In a
system serving more pages I can see that this kind of caching would be
useful, but in small systems you may wanna look at an alternative
server.

I too am concerned about potential barriers to the success of the WWW.

We are having the same experience in Hewlett Packard. Users are rightly
concerned about learning new formats. My ideas for combatting this are:

        a) introduce simple to use WYSIWYG editors for HTML
           (should be much much easier than Microsoft Word etc.)

        b) it should be trivial to include plain ASCII documents
           (my browser automatically recognises different formats
            based on document content and/or file extensions)

        c) simple filters for converting common document formats to/from HTML
           (e.g. Microsoft Word via RTF)

        d) writing a good beginners guide for HTML aimed at minimising
           learning problems

        e) Getting out there and letting people know how good WWW is.

IMHO HTML is much simpler than most existing formats and once people
get over their fright, they will become enthusiasts.

Dave Raggett

p.s. what are the situations when people do want greater control over spacing?

You may care to look at the HTML+ DTD. It includes support for both of
these, whilst remaining a simple generic format:

    <P STYLE="MARGIN"> for sidenotes

    <GROUP TYPE="CHAPTER"> ... </GROUP>

The GROUP element is intended to enclose books, chapters, sections etc.
which may even extend over multiple HTML+ documents. I have made a special
effort to help authors preserve information when converting to HTML+
while allowing simple browsers to ignore such information. This has been
done without the need to an explosion of tags as in the ISO work on SGML DTDs.

HTML+ is intended to allow people to generate high quality paper documents
and includes features such as sidenotes and floating panels to that effect.
Tob Raisch's style sheets for HTML also promise to give authors greater
control without compromising the presentation independence of HTML+ itself.

Not sure what that 8M is.  It's not caching anything.
Be sure to strip the executables if you take the distributed ones --
I notice they are 300k to 600k whereas a stripped on is around
say 150k (that's compiled including the WAIS gateway code)
as they were compiled with debug flags on.

Anyone know what the 8M is?

Did you mean "&em;" or <em> rather than "en"? I like your suggestion
it is simple and easy to implement.

Perhaps you could help me with a naming problem. In the HTML+ DTD I use
a single tag for all inline emphasis, using a string attribute value
to specify different categories of emphasis. My original name was EMPH
but feel this is perhaps too long. I then thought of contracting this
to EM, but see now that this might be confused with an em space.

Any ideas for what I should call this tag?

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

Subject: WYSIWYG editor for HTML (p.s. and that spacing discussion)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Well, I've been working on a WYSIWYG beast for editing HTML, using the
Andrew Toolkit.  The editor is currently not far away from beta testing
as is.  However, I'd like to provide support for editing foreign
characters and the like, but I just don't know what's available.  Is
there an exhaustive list of "special" characters which HTML supports? 

When I've put this in, I'll provide it for beta test to interested
people who already have the Andrew Toolkit. 

Oh, and BTW, I would FAR prefer double newline to be a paragraph break,
rather than the (entirely artificial, it seems) <p> construct.  And BTW,
when reading files, my editor cleans up text by converting all
whitespace to normal spaces and collapsing them down to singletons,
except in a <pre>, in which case nothing is done to the text.  And
multiple <p>'s are also collapsed to singletons.

It will be interesting to see what happens with this -- anyone know if

	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (UPI) -- Adobe Systems Inc. rolled out Tuesday
its much-awaited Acrobat program, designed to simplify communications
between office computers.
	Adode, which debuted the program at a news conference in New York,
promised Acrobat will make it practical to distribute electronic
versions of reports, newspapers and books, complete with artwork,
photographs and typefaces.
	``Acrobat will fundamentally charge the economics of information by
removing the critical barriers that have kept electronic documents from
moving between computers,'' said John Warnock, chairman and chief
executive officer.
	``Today's paper-based information is hampered by the physical media,''
WArnock said. ``Acrobat technology liberates information and the flow of
ideas and allows it to enter the electronic age.''
	Analysts have called the product a break-through, saying it could
double Abode's annual revenues, which were $265 million last year.
	Shares jumped $3 a share on Monday in acticipation of the
announcement, then slid 50 cents to $72 in over-the-counter trading.
	Besides internal corporate uses, Acrobat may also be useful to
publishers seeking easier ways of distributing information. A newspaper
could be distributed through telephone lines into computers, with the
pages appearing the same as they do in print.
	Adobe said the Acrobat products preserve the essential look and feel
of even the most complex documents that contain photographs, various
typefaces and color.
	The product's release is an advance from competing products and
arrives in the market prior to rival programs that are expected to come
from such major players as Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and
Xerox Corp.
	As a result, Acrobat may set an industry standard. Its previous
products, led by its flagship PostScript that tells a computer or
printer how to format characters, are well-regarded in the industry.
	The first versions of Acrobat will work on Apple's Macitosh system
and personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Unix and DOS systems wil be available later this year.
	Abode unveiled three products -- Acrobat Reader, Acrobat Exchange and
Acrobat Distiller -- using its portable document format.
	Acrobat Reader, to be used for viewing documents, will be sold at $35
a copy at quantities of more the 500.
	Acrobat Exchange, to be used for networks, will be sold at $195 for a
single copy and $146 a copy at quantities of more than 100 copies.
	Acrobat Distiller, to be used for creating documents, was priced at
$695 for individual users and $2,495 for networks.

This goes along with our experience (though our load is only maybe 40%
of yours.)  Just passing text files along is pretty cheap.

Of course, if you're getting to pick the platform, part of it depends
how you'll have the server configured and what kinds of access it will
be doing.  If you are using standard multithreading with lots of
fork()ing then a system with copy-on-write would be nice.  If your
server does lots of execing instead, this won't help as much.  Lots of
physical memory is always nice (lazy man's performance philosophy is
to let the OS do the caching.)  Being able to plock() the server
process so it doesn't get swapped might be good, though if it's as
heavily used as you hope this won't be an issue much.

Will people be using this system to just fetch simple HTML files, or
as a gateway, or to do frequent queries of large databases?  I expect
that only in the last of these three is adequate CPU power likely to
enter into the picture.  If you anticipate doing cryptographic
manipulations as part of transactions (e.g. kerberos authentication or
PEM or something like that) obviously that can eat some CPU.

I know they explicitly kept the specs secret until their product line
was solid.  Once they release them they will propose it as a  
standard!  A sure way to get it accepted by the net....

This can be solved in the browser (either by forcing a fixed width
or by computing the tabs by look ahead within the element).

Yes, tables might actually solve most of the problem.

I was just offering a different way to think about the problem, which is
that we don't have to choose whether whitespace is significant or not, if
we need it to be significant just add an element that does what we need.

I vote that by default whitespace not be significant, as several people
have already argued for better than I could.

Plexus only uses 1.2M and that includes the image decoding stuff.  It also
doesn't exec very often so the overhead on the system is negligible, you
have to worry more about the network usage than system usage.  It doesn't
cache anything itself, it assumes your OS is smart enough to do that.

I'm running a public Mosaic group annotation server on

free to put the following line in your .Xdefaults:

XMosaic*annotationServer: hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001

Also feel free to post group annotations (text or audio); consider
this an experiment in community-wide asynchronous collaboration.
We've got ~50MB free for this; I certainly wouldn't mind filling it
up.

Subject: Cello Beta 0.3 loose.

Cc: fatty!teknoids@dxmint.cern.ch, fatty!cello-l@dxmint.cern.ch
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.2 PL15]

Folks:

Beta version 0.3 of Cello is hereby released on an unsuspecting world.
You can pick it up from fatty.law.cornell.edu in /pub/LII/Cello, or by
clicking on the 'pick up viewers' link on the default home page in the
distribution.

The new version fixes the following problems:


1) Crashes when searching using particularly long WAIS search strings.

2) Memory leakage of various minor kinds, probably visible as gradually
slowing performance when accessing HTML files with large numbers of
links.


It adds the following features:

1) 'enter search terms' dialog box now appears automagically when you
access a searchable document, eg. a WAIS title page.

2) DOS filenames may now be relative.  It seems to have escaped
general notice that Cello may be used as an HTML viewer regardless of
whether there is a usable Net connection or not...  

IMPORTANT NOTE:
In order to implement relative names, it was necessary to make a
slight change in the way DOS file names are handled.  The correct way
to designate a file named (for instance) f:\foo\bar\bletch.htm is

HREF="file://localhost/f:/foo/bar/bletch.htm"

Note that the colon following the f (the drive designator) was not
previously required.

PLEASE ASSIST BY REPORTING GPFs:

There have been very few reports of GPFs and other Windows crashes.  I
am not fool enough to believe that Cello is blameless in this respect
or even capable of being used for more than 300 ms. without crashing.
Please report these; they're virtually impossible to path-test for.
If possible report what you were doing when the GPF occurred, what
resource you were accessing, and the funny hex number that shows up in
the GPF dialog box.  Indefinite hangs are also of interest.


Happy motoring,
Tb.

Our KUfacts machine supports 600-1000 Lynx logins per day with reasonable
speed.  It is also used as a productional machine for academic research
work.  The hardware behind the machine is a rs/6000 350 with only 32 mbytes
of RAM, so it isn't what you would call a 'heavy' machine.  Lynx usage
is in general very unintensive with most processes using maybe 2% of the
processor with peaks in the teens during file transfers.

Subject: RE two PREs

Presently in xmosaic PRE is presented in a typewriter font; this is okay
for code examples (unless you have in-line annotations that you want 
distinguished from the code) but not for all forms of text that should
be displayed verbatim (poetry).  So either two PREs are needed, or the
font change in PRE should be invoked specifically, perhaps by using
CODE inside PRE.

Subject: Re: HTML spec


WWW is only at the periphery of my attention, so I
apologize if my comment is not "on point" and is not
very elaborated.

I believe the growing pains of HTML can only be
resolved by evolving to the SGML architectural
form concept, as exemplified by HyTime.  That is
not to say that WWW architectural forms should
*be* HyTime, but *a* set of architectural forms
will provide a baseline for WWW browsers.  It
will be impossible to arrive at a monolithic 
answer for all problems from whitespace to
tables.  Different WWW applications will arise
although this should never preclude the most
minimal application.  In fact, one of the chief
benefits will be the ability to preserve a
minimal application which is the key to 
rapid and wide diffusion of the concept.

Judging from my experiences in talking to real people in the real
world, the fastest way to kill WWW will be to go more strongly down
the SGML path.

(I realize the above isn't an incredibly valuable contribution to the
ongoing discussions; I haven't had time to type up my feelings in any
detail yet, but at this point I think that dealing with SGML in
general is a complete waste of time and that we'd currently be a lot
further along if we weren't burdened by the SGML baggage we've
inherited and are still carrying.  99.99% of the people I talk to want
to put rich documents online, want control over what it looks like,
and don't give a damn about semantic markup or distinctions between
document structure and appearance AT ALL; the other 0.01% are still
grappling with this whole keyboard-monitor-mouse concept.)

I wouldn't care to dispute your point of view.  But since
you went down that road, I think what I suggest is the
correct approach to the problems I've seen discussed here.
Chucking it all is, of course, another kind of solution.

You are very right about that !. HTML as it is now is simple to learn.
In fact I learned by simply starting (and finished with the vatican
exhibit). There were some things that I would like to control, and are
not (yet?) possible, and some never will be, but I liked it already
as it is.
Ofcourse it took some time to find out the nice tricks. for example
to have the editor replace all CRCR pairs with a CR<p>CR but at the
point I did the last page, it went all very easy.

- frans

O, the points that were missing at that time, which I would have liked
text running around the picture, pre formatted text in a nice font,
and a mouse position depended selection inside an image
(yes I know we have now ISMAP, and I don't like it at all, because it
 depends so much on the server: I cannot simply setup a document that
 works this way, without storing this document on a very special server...
 I want to make a document, that should contain the relevant info, not
 the server!)

but the net result is still pretty good.
Now if there only were a program that color quantifies a page of images to
use not more than say 150 colors, but each image itself not more than 50...

I guess the wish list never ends, and that's what we are all avraid off.

    Or anything to convert GNU-info to html.

Thanks.

If you get no hits on a WAIS database, the server will return a
catalog that looks something like this:

Catalog for database: ./comp-emacs
Date: Jun 16 02:15:13 1993
62 total documents

Document # 1
Headline: steff@ims. Re: Re: I thought TeX was supposed to be free!

Document # 2
Headline: rms@gnu.ai Re: Emacs 19.10 available
DocID: 0 3062 /usr2/news/comp/emacs/8593

(...)

As an exercise, mark up the catalog into HTML and return it, attractively
formatted, as a document.  (Or if its' too big send it back in a few
different chunks).

I'm not sure if this fits your bill (since texinfo is one step removed
from plain info), but it won't hurt advertising this piece of code again:

I have written a texinfo to html converter in Python.  Python is an
object-oriented interpreted language (also written by me).  The html
converter is part of the Python source distribution (in demo/www); you
can ftp this distribution from ftp.cwi.nl, directory pub/python, file
python0.9.8.tar.Z.  It runs on most UNIX platforms.

If you have a Sparc or SGI platform, I can make a binary of just the
texinfo-to-html program available for you; this would save you the
trouble of building Python just to run the script, but means you can't
modify the program (the html it generates may need some
customization).  Let me know if you're interested in this.

Subject: group annotation server

Anyone remember the `Maps in a Mirror' book by Orson Scott Card where
he wrote a prequel short-story to the `Foundation' series by Isaac
Asimov?  The nifty part of the story was the cross-referencing room in
the Imperial Library, where the ultimate privilege for librarians was
to work in the room.

What happened in the room?  Books, articles, papers, and similar
things were displayed on the librarians computers, and they got to
annotate them.  Phrases that set off associations in their minds were
linked, and the end result was a new set of possible directions for
the documents to be explored in.

I hope the Annotation server can be like this (despite the need for a
wide pipe into the backbone :).  It seems like a good start, at any
rate.

Has anyone considered setting up WAN annotation servers, and those
servers exchanging annotations a-la NNTP?

Ahhhh.... Dreams of XANADU.  (Where's my laudanum?)

This is the original vision of Vannavar Bush, Doug Englebart, and the enfant
terrible of 'hypertext', Terrifying Ted Nelson.  <grin>

Read Literary Machines, or Computer Lib/Dream Machines by Nelson.

Objective:

The main objective of this workshop is to show how the new generation of
open hypermedia systems, such as Microcosm, can be used to build
richly-resourced, multimedia learning environments. Participants will be
introduced to authoring in Microcosm and shown how this environment is
being used to create a campus-wide structure for multimedia learning.
Examples of material developed as part of the project will be used as
illustrations. Participants will also be shown how existing applications
can be integrated into such an environment and linked to the multimedia
material in the resource-base.

Programme:

10:00-10:30     Registration & Coffee

10:30-12:30     Introduction 
			Review of existing systems, the need for open
			systems, overview of Microcosm

Subject: Re: RE two PREs

PRE was deigned to address a very specific problem:
putting in information which had been PREformatted
in all kinds of ways (tables, diagrams included) using
plain ASCII text, in the assumption of fixed-width
characters.

PRE MUST always be displayed using fixed width characters:
indeed, even when <B>old has been turned on, if a bold
font can't be found with the same pitch, then bold should
not be shown. [Recent usergripe that his formatting was
all off becuase he used bold ina PRE].

Poetry is somethingdifferent altogether.  It is less
obvious that you ned to have significant newlines, especially
as lines in powetry can wrap.  I would suggest for HTML+
an element for poetry and elements for verses, with
lines being paragraphs within the verse, for example.
But mark it up.

Subject: Re: mosaic as a better wais client; mark up the "catalog"
Cc: h


This is a case for an HTTP server which sits on top of the WAIS
database and gives an enhanced hypertext view of it.  I think
Jim Fulton was wondering about this.  A simple example is that,
instead of returning a search result with an item
whose name is "Search failed, here is the catlogue", which
looks strange preceded by "The search produced one result:",
it could give a nice informative hypertext message, and
(ifg it is small) include the catalogue immediately.

Anothre example if that the server could have a home page
with links to any help about it, instead of having to
serach for "help" which sometimes gives lots of othre things
too.

Subject: gateway WWW - Oracle



The Uniform Resource Locator for this document is:
http://moulon.inra.fr:80/oracle/why_oracle.html

Why "oracle/" in the URL ?
==========================

My first idea was : oracle://server/database/file, whith the following algorithm.  

Algorithm
+++++++++

 o client 
    o client know the scheme : it use the adequate protocol to get the
      document (like nntp for news:) 
    o else client know a gateway : it send the entire URL to this gateway 
    o otherwise : client use a default protocol (http) to send the entire
      URL to the server specified in the URL.  
       o server is NOT a WWW server : ERROR 
 o server 
    o server know this scheme 
       o local document : server send the document.  
       o else a new URL is linked with this URL : 
          o server send the new URL to the client.  
          o client retry with the new URL.  
    o otherwise : ERROR 

Example
+++++++

 o "server_A" has a database "data_A" 
 o client request "oracle://server_A/data_A/file" to "server_A", with default
   protocol http : server send the document.  
 o "data_A" is moved to "server_B", whith new name "data_B" 
 o old client request "oracle://server_A/data_A/file" to "server_A" 
    o "server_A" send the new URL "oracle://server_B/data_B/file" 
    o client request "oracle://server_B/data_B/file" to "server_B" 

Conclusion
++++++++++

Unfortunatly, for me, this is not the algorithm of WWW.

 o i can't use "oracle://server/database", because client reply : 

   WWW Alert:  Unable to access document.

 o i can't define "WWW_oracle_GATEWAY", because it's a server for
   local databases but not for ALL databases.  
 o my server is very minuscule, i don't want 2 minuscules servers on 2
   differents ports : one for "http", another for "oracle" 

Syntax is "http://server/...oracle/...",i.e.  a default protocol http (for the client)
whith the string "oracle/" (for the server) to recognize this new scheme.  

p.s.:
 l'URL de la version francaise est "http://moulon.inra.fr/oracle/pourquoi_oracle.html"

The ability to embed foreign formats seems a good thing as it allows us to
take advantage of evolving de facto standards for a whole range of things.

Just how critical is building in support for equations to the continuing
growth of the web? IMHO long term success is more important than intellectual
purity.

Some general issues:

    o   trade-off of complexity versus coverage

        ISO have an SGML DTD for maths - but this is "clearly" too complex.
        Perhaps there is a reasonable middle ground which would satisfy
        most peoples needs. Increasing the coverage from that point would
        enormously add to the complexity. So what is the right coverage?

    o   the impact of yet another standard for equations

        A simple approach for equations (which is easy to convert to/from
        existing standards) may be worthwhile if widely adopted ...

    o   the large numbers of math symbols in use

        A real problem this. Which ones are common place?

    o   just how much code is needed for parsing/rendering?

        Lets keep browsers simple!

    o   what to do with line mode displays

        Well you could just show the markup format ...

I will have a look at eqn and Latex to get a feeling for what would
be involved in extending HTML+ to directly support equations, and how
one could deal with it in browsers.

Being a technical university, maths is highly desirable for us.

My answer would be "whatever TeX can do, use that". The best way to do
that is to use TeX, either by displaying the output of an existing dvi
viewer, e.g. xdvi, or make WWW browsers into TeX viewers (maybe limited
to just mathematical TeX). What to do with char displays? Do what TeX
does (I don't *know* what it does, I don't want to know, I just know
that its users seem happy with it).

We use (amongst other things) DECWrite, which deals with equations by
embedding limited, math only, TeX code (actually stored in a separate
file), and translating it to DECwrite's internal format for final
display. It works well. DEC saw no reason to invent a new format, and
given that TeX already exists, I  see no point in reinventing it,
either. Face it, the hard bit has been done - the browser author
doesn't have to know what the Tex code *does*, simply hand the input to
it and render the output. Yes, I know it's not trivial for browser
authors, but my guess is that reinventing maths symbol processing for
HTML would be worse. Do the TeX stuff in a separate process, if you
like. Ghostscript takes this approach of separating viewer and processor, I believe.

The same arguments apply to eqn, for sites which use that. We don't,
but the code exists as groff. Fine; lets use that. If WWW land goes for
eqn, I'm sure it's not too difficult to translate existing TeX math to
eqn math. And once we can embed eqn or Tex math, why not arbitrary
troff/groff or TeX? This has the distinct advantage of handling native
man pages and TeXinfo straight off. 

Finally - a limited set of math symbols just wouldn't work. Authors
will stop using it as soon as they realised that bits of it failed to
come out. An HTML+ math format would need to be as complete as TeX/eqn
from day one, which is a tall order; otherwise its like only supporting
the 20 most frequently used letters of the alphabet on the basis that
they cover 98% of English text. True, but still not acceptable.

I agree. We are taking this approach in a tex2html translator we are
currently building.
The idea is to translate into HTML as much as possible and include
the rest (pictures, equations, tables, etc.) as inlined images.
Then, an HTML viewer need only handle inlined images and allow text to
flow around them.

( Message-Id: <9306152358.AA37602@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu> )

Dear Michael,

What do you mean by static link? Do you mean a browser menu option that lets
users mail comments back to authors? Sounds like a good idea. How do you
specify values for the subject and other header fields? I guess you could
use the TITLE attribute for the subject, but that seems pushing the notation
too far from its original concept.

{\begin aside}

While I think about it, the attribute "REV" and Tim's suggested values aren't
particularly transparent. Perhaps HTML+ should use "REL" for relationship
rather than "REV" (why "REV"?). Also "author" might be better than "made".
What is the METHODS attribute intended for? Does anyone use it?

What are your views on the attributes for LINK?

{\end aside}

My latest version of the HTML+ DTD includes a FORM tag in place of MSG.

        <!ELEMENT FORM - - (MH*, (%main;|INPUT|SELECT)*)>
        <!ATTLIST FORM
            id      ID        #IMPLIED
            action  %URL;     #IMPLIED>

        <!ELEMENT MH - - CDATA -- RFC 822 header fields -->

The idea is that you could have multiple forms in each document. The FORM
tag acts as a wrapper for each form and defines the action to be take when
the user presses the "commit" key.

By specifying a mailTo URL the form would be mailed to the designated
person. The MH tag allows you to specify the mail headers is a more
general way that would be possible with attributes to the FORM tag itself.

        <FORM action="mailTo:grobe@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu">
            <MH> Subject: comments on proposal
            <INPUT id="f1">Your Comments</INPUT>
        </FORM>

The presence of "mailTo:" in an LINK or A element would imply the need to
pop-up an editor for the message with the appropriate header fields already
filled in. The FORM element on the other hand creates the message itself.

If the action starts "http:...", the form would be sent as a query for
this URL. The encoding of the forms contents would depend on the METHODS
attribute and default to an id:value listing following a "?" suffix.

I still need to do some more work on the actual details of the encoding format,
e.g. escaping white space and dealing with multiple values. In practice, it
seems much nicer to define a new HTTP method for forms data, than to try and
force it into the URL syntax.

Comments on Tables
------------------

I am getting uncomfortable about the detailed column specification format,
e.g. it defines how wide the fields are without taking into account the width
of the headers.

A better approach would be to let the browser work this out for itself.
This fits in well with your suggestion for adding a placement attribute to
specify center, left, or right justification. In the following I have
used a separate tag for tables rather than overloading DL:

    <!ELEMENT TBL - - (TT?, TH*, TD*)>
    <!ATTLIST TBL
        id      ID        #IMPLIED
        cols    CDATA     #REQUIRED -- number of columns --
        compact (compact) #IMPLIED  -- if present use compact style --
        border  (border)  #IMPLIED  -- if present draw borders -->

    <!ELEMENT TT - O (%text;)+ -- table title -->

    <!ELEMENT TH - O (%text;)+ -- column heading -->
    <!ATTLIST TH
        S   NUMBER  1           -- columns spanned --
        L   (L)     #IMPLIED    -- left aligned --
        C   (C)     #IMPLIED    -- center aligned --
        R   (R)     #IMPLIED    -- right aligned --
        D   (D)     #IMPLIED    -- decimal aligned -->

    <!ELEMENT TD - O (P|UL|OL|%text;)+ -- field data -->
    <!ATTLIST TD
        S   NUMBER  1           -- columns spanned --
        L   (L)     #IMPLIED    -- left aligned --
        C   (C)     #IMPLIED    -- center aligned --
        R   (R)     #IMPLIED    -- right aligned --
        D   (D)     #IMPLIED    -- decimal aligned -->

The above approach allows you to state <TD L> which is perhaps nicer
than <TD A=Left>. The drawback is I don't know how in SGML to define several
attributes as being mutually exclusive. *** What do you think? ***


                  An Example of a Table
    ___________________________________________________
    |          |          average          | other    |
    |          |   height    |     weight  | category |
    |_________________________________________________|
    | males    |    1.9      |      .003   | yyy      |
    |_________________________________________________|
    | females  |    1.7      |      .002   |      xxx |
    ___________________________________________________

    <tbl cols="4" border>
        <tt> An Example of a Table
        <th> <th s="2"> average <th l> other
        <th> <th> height <th> weight <th l> category
        <td> males <td> 1.9 <td> .003 <td l> yyy
        <td> females <td> 1.7 <td> .002 <td r> xxx
    </tbl>

The browser works through the table to determine the types and widths of
each field and how much room to allocate for each column. Using a fixed font
for tables would speed things up a bit. By default headers are centred while
text fields are left aligned. Numbers are vertically aligned on the units,
making them harder to deal with.

How does that sound?

Date: Fri, 18 Jun 93 15:06:33 BST
From: "Peter Lister, Cranfield Computer Centre" <ccprl@xdm001.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk>

I've thought for some time that a nice feature in WWW servers would be
the ability to look inside a remote tar (or tar.Z) file (or an ar
library or whatever), i.e. remotely list the contents or just extract
one file. I've been thinking how I could build this into a server like plexus.

So that a normal URL which names a tar file will simply retrieve the
file (as most users want, I assume)  there needs to be some way of
referring to the subunit of the file. The obvious way is to use #, e.g.

http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#blech.c

 - this would indicate to the server that it is to unpack blech.c from
/foo/bar.tar.Z and send it back as a normal file. However, I have only
seen the # documented as something which browsers can use for internal
hyperlinks, not as part of the a URL that can be sent to a http server.
Is this a problem?

The question mark would seem better suited to search the list of contents, e.g.

http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z?*.c

would return

blech.c	erk.c	glug.c

A related question is whether I can have slashes in the test following
the # or ?. e.g. for a tar file with relative filenames

http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#./blech.c

would be common. Since slashes are meaningful to an http: URL, and the
browser can interpret them, would this cause confusion?

   I don't think this is correct.  Any url can make use of the # directive.
It just tells a browser to go to a specific part of a document instead of
to the beginning.  I don't know of any browsers that actually 'generate'
these internally.

   The only problem with using ./ in the path would be that the browser
is likely to interpret it as a relative pathname.  For example, 
http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#./blech.c would more than likely be translated
into http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#/foo/blech.c by a browser.

   It would be fairly easy to tell the replacing function not to replace
any . or .. after a # sign though.  (I haven't tried this with mosaic or
lynx yet, but I know that my emacs browser would replace the ./ with nothing
so the url above would be http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#blech.c)

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.2 PL15]

Folks:

Cello beta version 0.4 is now available on 
fatty.law.cornell.edu, directory pub/LII/Cello.

The new version fixes the following:

-- Assorted GPFs resulting primarily from Developer Silliness.
   (scattered reports)
   
-- Problems with quoting of SRC attribute in <IMG> tags.  Net 
   result was an inability to retrieve image files on some 
   servers.
   (reported by Alert Cellist Nick Williams)
   
-- Text, title, and status bar backgrounds are now set to match 
   Windows system color, rather than defaulting to white.
   (reported by Alert Cellist Nick Williams)
   
-- Complete Windows crash caused by jumps to "empty" or 
   unavailable Gopher links is now fixed.
   (reported by Alert Cellists Paul Birch and Lars Johansen)
   
-- Isolated WAIS crashes repaired
   (reported by Alert Cellist Paul Birch, who will now be able 
   to read the Bluegrass archives undisturbed)
   
-- Problems with whitespace in files mailed to someone.


There are numerous small UI enhancements, no one of which is 
worth writing up.  I have also made a few small changes to the 
default home page, where there was at least one incorrect URL.

Unsolved mysteries of science:

   The Machine from Hell at Cornell continues to suffer from 
   FTP hangs on files > 4K bytes.  It appears that the upcall 
   mechanism isn't working correctly.  Anyone suffering from this 
   problem please contact me directly.

Viewer news:

   A Windows MPEG viewer is available at
      file://bode.ee.ualberta.ca/pub/dos/win3/mpeg
   There are assorted files to get depending on your video 
   hardware.  It seems to run OK with Cello, but not 
   necessarily with my video hardware (grin).  Anybody who
   wants to do some experimentation and report to CELLO-L is 
   hereby warmly invited to do so.

Misunderstanding. I mean to say that I don't know how or whether
servers will react to # in a URL; as far as I am aware, browsers simply
react to them when they see them in an HTML file. I should be more precise.

Exactly -  to tar, ./foo is NOT equivalent to foo. Can anyone who is
knows URLS give the word on whether slashes should be interpreted after a ? or #.

Further, is a null search term significant or not? Is "foo?" equivalent
to "foo". I would personally hope NOT, as a null default search term
could be useful (e.g. to return a catalogue).

      I don't think this is correct.  Any url can make use of the # directive.
   It just tells a browser to go to a specific part of a document instead of
   to the beginning.  I don't know of any browsers that actually 'generate'
   these internally.

But I think Peter is correct that, given a URL with a # inside it, the browser
doesn't send back the part beginning with #.  That is, seeing the URL above, a
browser would ask www for a document /foo/bar.tar.Z and then look for the
anchor "blech.c" inside it--which is not what he wants.

      The only problem with using ./ in the path would be that the browser
   is likely to interpret it as a relative pathname.  For example,
   http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#./blech.c would more than likely be translated
   into http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#/foo/blech.c by a browser.

      It would be fairly easy to tell the replacing function not to replace
   any . or .. after a # sign though.  (I haven't tried this with mosaic or
   lynx yet, but I know that my emacs browser would replace the ./ with nothing
   so the url above would be http://www/foo/bar.tar.Z#blech.c)

As mentioned above, I don't think the browser should interpret the part after
# as part of a path, since the # character is supposed to be followed by an
anchorid and anchorids are not hierarchical.  Wanted to note, though, that
according to the URL spec "/." may be simplified but "./" is not.

Of course, according to the URL spec gopher addresses have a slash between
gtype and selector, too, and that doesn't seem to have affected implementation
any.

I agree, I feel that the ability to support postscript, eqn, tex, and the
ISO math DTD all at one whack far outweighs building in equation support.

Furthermore, the server could convert from just about anything to postscript
if needed, so that would seem a good format to support for you graphics
based browser writers (ghostscript will even draw in your window for you
if you can figure out how to make it work).

Hi Tony,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I am rather snowed under
these days.

Can you tell more about your implementation of Forms for MidasWWW?

I enclose the current HTML+ definitions for forms at the end of this
message. The new FORM tag allows several forms to be included in
the same document. This tag also defines what to do when the user
presses the "commit" key (normally the Return key), e.g. to send the
form's contents as a query to a server or to send it to a designated
person as an email message. The new MH tag allows you to define
arbitrary email header fields at the start of each message.

We still need to pin down how form contents can be passed to
servers as queries etc. and I would be very grateful for some
help in this regard. Some ideas for doing this with URLs are given
later on.

Now for an example which supposes that a server has been set up to help
sales staff configure quotes for computer workstations. It is based on
an expert system I worked on a couple of years ago.

    <FORM action="http://ukrc.hp.com:8002/s720">
        <H1>HP 9000 Series 720 Workstation</H1>

        <UL>
            <LI> 50 MHz PA-RISC CPU
            <LI> Wide range of graphics options
            <LI> 16 to 128 Mb ECC RAM and 2 optional disks
        </UL>

        <INPUT id="f1" type="INT" width="2" value="1"> Quantity </INPUT>

        <SELECT id="f2" compact> Graphics
            <ITEM id="i1" selected> Mono GRX
            <ITEM id="i2"> Color CRX
            <ITEM id="i3"> 2D Color VRX
        </SELECT>

        <SELECT id="f3" compact> Internal hard disks
            <ITEM id="i4"> 1 x 420 Mb
            <ITEM id="i5" selected error> 2 x 420 Mb
        </SELECT>
    
        <INPUT id="f4" type="bool" value="true" error> 3.5 inch floppy drive

        <P>
        *** You are only allowed two internal drives! ***
    </FORM>

The form starts with a header and a list of features for the workstation.
A quantity field follows which allows users to type a two digit integer.
It is initialised to the value "1".

Next there is a selection menu. Users have to choose one of a range of
graphics options. The initial value is the first item as indicated by
the selected attribute. The compact attribute tells the browser to render
the menu in a compact style, e.g. as a button with a drop down menu. For
menus supporting multiple selections, you would need to show the current
selections as a (truncated) list next to the dropdown button. The normal
(uncompact) style would be a permanently visible list, perhaps with some
kind of button to the left of each item, but visually distinct from
bulleted lists defined with the UL tag.

Fields can be marked as being in error or greyed out (disabled). The latter
case means the field cannot be altered - perhaps because its value is
constrained by the values of other fields.

The next field is also a selection menu. In this case the selected item
is marked as being in error and needing to be changed. The browser could
indicate this by a red splash next to the menu item.

The last field is a boolean checkbox, currently checked. It too is marked
as being in error and needing to be changed. The static text message which
follows indicates the nature of the problem.

Menus and checkboxes can be altered by clicking the mouse. Other kinds of
input fields require the user to set the input focus to that field, e.g.
by clicking with the mouse or using the tab/shift tab keys. Input fields
needing keyboard input show a cursor (blinking?) when they have the input
focus.

Pressing the Return key sends the form's content to the server designated
by the URL in the FORM tag. The server evaluates the form's contents
and in this case replies by sending a document containing the form, but
marked up to indicate the user has made some inconsistent choices for
disk drives.

This assumes that the browser encodes the form's contents as a
list of field ids and values following a "?" suffix after the URL.
It may be better to define a HTTP method for form data with a clean
encoding.

A suggested URL encoding:

    ? FIELD [ + FIELD ]*        -- ie FIELDs seperated by "+" --

where FIELD is:
    id:value                    -- single valued fields --
    id:(value[+value]*)         -- multi valued fields --

Selections would use the item id in place of the actual
string value.

Special characters should be replaced by "%" followed by the
two hex digits encoding the ASCII value.

The special chars are (based on Tim's URL spec for xalphas:

        + - % ( ) ! ^ & * $         (and all white space chars)

Note that URLs would then be of arbitrary length!

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

<!-- Forms: these are composed from input fields and selection menus

From: Tony Sanders <sanders@bsdi.com>

I'm working on adding a setext -> HTML converter to my HTTP server (I've
got it mostly working already, it's 42 lines of perl, will be about 75
when it's done).  The basic idea is to ease the mark-up required for simple
documents (like email) but it'll work for complex documents as well because
you can use other markup as needed.

Setext was created by Ian Feldman <ianf@random.se>, you can contact him for
his setext documents.  I'll try and make them available via HTTP after
I get my converter working better (they are in setext).

setext = structure-enchanced text

The Basics:

    Title		-> <TITLE>Title</TITLE>
    =====		-> <H1>Title</H1>
    subhead
    -------		-> <H2>subhead</H2>
    **bold**            -> <B>bold</B>
    ~italic~            -> <I>italic</I>
    _under_lined_       -> <I>under lined</I>
    hyper_text_         -> <A HREF="http:foo">hyper text</A>
    .. _hyper_text_ http:foo
    .. other dotdot lines are ignored

Note that you can put the ".. _hyper_text_ ..." lines anywhere (at the
end is a nice place).  This makes the text easier to read.

Setext also defines a blockquote and list style, I'll add support for
them before I release it.

<BLOCKQUOTE> for lines like:
> this is a block quote,
> look familiar?

and <UL>...</UL> for:
    * list item 1
    * list item 2

Currently I can convert documents like:

    Sample Setext Document
    ======================

    This is a sample setext_ document that shows off the various features
    of setext_ and how easy it is write hypertext documents.

    Wouldn't **you** like to be able to write documents using this _simple_
    form of document markup?

    What can you do with setext?
    ----------------------------

    Most of the things you want to do like:  headers, sub-headers, **bold**,
    _italic_, and hypertext links_.

    --sanders

    .. _links_  http:links
    .. _setext_ http:setext

>> What are your views on the attributes for LINK?

This is a very old posting.  I thought it might have some pertinance to the
current thread.  I might not how the same views as strongly now as when I first
wrote this, but it does identify some interesting LINK strategies....

	</rr>

------------------
November 22, 1993
------------------
[ I first posted this some weeks ago on the 'www-interest' list, and 
  received only one reply, (complementing me on my reference to Rexx.)

  I really had hoped that this post would start an interesting discussion
  on the topics I address, specifically the ideas of 'attention links' 
  'user documents' and 'transparent documents'.

  Are these ideas so obvious that they merit no discussion whatsoever?

  Always interested in replies, /rr ]


First of all, hearty congrats to the WWW people.  It's a great tool, and
since it is based on SGML, it has the broadest scope of any solution I have
yet seen.

To others, see the current issue of Byte magazine regarding "Info-Glut" and
SGML.  Interesting.

----------------------

I have a few recommendations regarding new link types in WWW.  This is based
on thinking about hyper-applications for almost 15 years, (ever since I 
first had the pleasure of hearing Ted Nelson speak in 1977.)

First though, there are a few ideas which I feel should be mentioned to 'set
the stage' for my list.

	Transparent Documents  --

		a transparent document is one which a user creates locally,
		and that is a new representation of an existant document.
		Transparent documents are used to create new local links on
		a document which I do not have permission to modify.

		Transparent documents can then be made available to others,
		(published) just as a "regular" document is, thus facilitating
		the creation of new works from old.

	User Documents --

		a user document is where I keep my "bookmarks", links to
		local documents, links to messages from others, links to
		my "attention" links, (see below).  User documents are where
		we, as navigators of the docuverse, are defined as individuals.

		They are also where we can keep links to other user documents
		which have been permitted to view/modify my own local documents.

		Another function of the User document is to collect users into
		an abstract group. (Thus, based on my membership in user 
		document 'Research Group', I am permitted access to materials
		'owned' by that group. Of course, messages sent to an abstract
		group then become available to all members of that group.)

		(Please note that a User Document is nothing more or less than
		 a collection of links, (as all documents are).)

------------------

Now, on to my list of link types....

There are 4 'minimal' link types which, I believe, a useful h-app *must* 
support.

	1.	Replacement
			-- when activated, replaces the current document
			   with a new document, (this is what WWW offers
			   today).

	2.	Annotation
			-- when activated, overlays a new document on the
			   current document, partially obscuring the original.
			   (An annotation must be dismissed by the reader.)

	3.	Inclusion
			-- when the document is created, elements from other
			   documents are collection to be included in the
			   representation of the current document.  (Quotes)

	4.	Expansion
			-- when activated, new information is added to the 
			   current document, expanding the original scope.

			   (Think of outline processors, and the collapse
			    of detail.)  

			   This is also a reflection of Nelson's concept of 
			   'stretch text'.  

			   A stretch-text definition of "stretch text" might be:

			   "Stretch text is{}a sentence{}that when{}collapsed
			    states it's thesis{}and when expanded adds detail." 

			   "Stretch text is where a sentence is constructed in 
			    such a way that when it is collapsed it states it's 
			    thesis in simple terms, and when expanded adds 
			    detail to further express itself."

There are 3 further types which I believe are necessary to complete the
function paradigm.


	6.	Execution

			-- when activated, some arbitrary function is performed.
			   The point that was mentioned about the lack of an
			   ubiquitious scripting language is well made.  Lisp
			   is too arcane for most.  Shell languages are too
			   platform specific.  What is needed is a simple
			   to understand, freely available scripting platform.
			   Although I hesitate to mention it, REXX might be
			   a reasonable choice due to it's broad availability.

	5.	Attention   (a specialisation of the Execution type)

			-- when the current document is modified (a link is
			   added, or removed, or the document is merely read)
			   a message is sent to the 'owner' of the attention
			   link.  This message creates a new link in the 'user
			   document' of the individual who placed the attention.

			   In this way, I could place a link onto a document I 
			   had interest in, and when it was changed or accessed
			   in some manner, I would be informed.

	7.	Collection  (a non-local specialisation of the Execution type)

			-- when activated, a collection link leaves the current
			   document, and 'travels' the docuverse, in search of
			   other documents which satisfy it's internal criteria.
			   This is the concept of a 'knowbot'.

			   Collection links can be activated based on day and
			   time, much like the WAIS questions in the MAC 
			   WAIS interface, WAIS-Station.  They could also be
			   activated based on external events, such as the 
			   activation of an attention link.

			   Collection links would be written in the ubiquitious
			   scripting language, and would only be allowed to 
			   operate on documents which were EXPLICITLY permitted.


----------------------------


One of the missing pieces here is the ability of creating new h-texts, and 
adding new links to old h-texts.

Hypertext, and like systems, are of limited use if they do not support 
collaboration.  I feel that this is a VERY important point.

When might we expect extensions to WWW that support collaboration?


----------------------------

So.....

	Scenerio:

		I start my session with my h-app, and open my user document.

		I notice that 17 of my attention links have been activated 
		in the last day.

		I select the most interesting and activate the link which
		it created in my personal user document.

		I am now reading an article which I previously linked, and
		see that an annotation which I made some time ago has been
		added to, by a colleague.

		The comments are pertinant to my current work, so I create
		a new local 'transparent' document to mirror the original 
		work.

		On this new document, I make a few new annotations and decide
		to made this new work available to the research group of which
                I am leader.  I place a link to it in the user document which
                represents my working group.

                I also send a new document link to the colleague who made the
                original comments, so that he can see how I have interpreted
                his ideas, and included them into my own research.

                I move ever onwards...

---------------------

Ok, I hope that that fuels a little discussion, and I would *love* to hear
from others regarding these ideas.

Subject: NeXT client

Sorry if I am covering ground covered elsewhere (FAQ's), but I  
thought this might be an appropriate forum for my questions.

I am investigating the possibility of using WWW as the central app  
for our proposed electronic library system (Xel - Xavier electronic  
library).  Having come here recently (2 months ago) from a  
CD-ROM/Hypertext company, WWW appeals to me for a number of reasons.   
I have also worked with various _SGML_, or _SGML-like_ engines (OWL  
Guide, CDAuthor Hypertext, KRS, PLS, Hyperwriter, WorldView, IDEAS,  
Mark-It, etc) and would like to build on that.

The library has four NeXT machines, which will form the seed of the  
system, and they will be the platform where capabilities of the Web  
are first demonstrated (I hope).  I would like to prepare a demo of a  
home page providing access to regional resources (ie. telnet'ing to  
other library catalogues, ftp sites, etc) sometime in the next few  
weeks.  


I realize the latest version (0.16) of the NeXT Hypermedia  
Browser/Editor does not support telnet, gopher, etc., but I would  
like to use the NeXT for these early demos if possible.  Besides, I  
am new to NeXT, love it, and would like to use it for document  
creation/development. Once I get into the development environment in  
more detail I would be interested in helping in any way I can with  
the NeXT WWW app. 


- Does anybody have a NeXT browser that supports these functions, or  
is there a way to telnet from the current version in some way?  


- If not, I have recently loaded MouseX for X11R5 - does anybody have  
any experience with Viola or other X11 apps using this version?   
Should I obtain a different X app for NeXT that has been proven with  
some of these?  


- I have also recently loaded the Cello app, but would like to stay  
away from DOS/Windows if possible for now.

I appreciate any info you may be able to provide, and am looking  
forward to working with WWW and the Web development community.

Thanks

Dave,

Mathematics should *not* be considered a foreign format. It should be fully
integrated and allow easy construction of hypertext with lots of references.
Typical mathematical/scientific exposition skips what more advanced readers
will consider insignificant steps. It should be possible to expand such steps
by just clicking on them.

I don't see why support for equations goes against intellectual purity at all.
Equation support is quite clean; i.e., it's ideally suited for markup.
Consider also that if it were supported, it would be pretty easy to set up
filters that would allow the text to be parsed and ingested into symbolic
mathematics packages.

Without adequate support for equations and general mathematical notation, the
Web will not be able to reasonably support scientific papers and I think that
a lot of potential utility is lost. The Web will then degenerate from being a
potentially very useful tool to being an interesting toy. But that's just my
opinion.

>I will have a look at eqn and Latex to get a feeling for what would

Eqn and TeX are essentially equivalent as far as mathematics is concerned.
Yeah, TeX is supposed to be more ``standard" in terms of spacing and so forth,
but structurally, they are equivalent. Eqn is old, but incredibly useful and
quite clean as well.

Thanks, Torben

From: "William M. Perry" <wmperry@guava.ucs.indiana.edu>

This is to announce the release of version .55beta of the emacs world
wide web browser.

This has some fairly large changes, but most of them won't be visible
to the users.

For those not familiar with w3-mode already, it is a hypertext browser
written entirely in emacs-lisp.  It runs under emacs 18, emacs 19,
Lucid Emacs, and Epoch equally well.  (Well, not equally, but close
enough)  It takes advantage of different features of each emacs.
(Font/mouse support in lucid/epoch/emacs19, graphics support in epoch,
etc)

The browser can be ftped from:
ftp://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/w3.tar.z       For the main files
ftp://moose.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/extras.tar.z   For support files

The extras.tar.z file contains: ange-ftp, background, transparent,
gopher, forms, and nntp lisp packages.  (Other people wrote _MUCH_
better gopher/ftp interfaces than I could hope to, so I use those)

If you already have these files installed on your system, there is no
need for you to get the extras.tar.z file.

Once you have unpacked the w3.tar.z file in your lisp directory, you
should be able to just edit the Makefile to point to where you want
the lisp files installed, where your .emacs file is, and where emacs
is located on your system.  Then type 'make install' and it will add a
few autoload statements to your .emacs and change your load-path
slightly.  (You can just type 'make w3' to just compile the lisp code
if you want to make the changes to your .emacs yourself)

Documentation on the emacs browser can be obtained from:

http://cs.indiana.edu:80/elisp/w3/docs.html

Please send me some email if you pick up this package, just so I can
tell roughly how many people are using it.

Also send mail if you find any files that cause w3 to break (already
know of one that causes an infinite loop: try to avoid
http://sipb.mit.edu:8001/afs/sipb/user/mcmullan/ht/sls.html if at all
possible - the multiple nested lists cause the parser to freak right
now, and I haven't had time to track it down).

Happy Emacsing!

From: Tony Sanders <sanders@bsdi.com>

Here is some log file summerizing scripts for Plexus log files (it should
be easy to modify this for other formats).  I will be including them in
the next release.

I have two scripts, usage.byhost and usage.byurl which generates output
like the following.  They read in the previous results and then merge the
current log info.  There is also a script that runs them and then empties
and restarts the log file.

>>>>>> usage.host
   694 137.39.95.2			(this is my host)
   434 xxx.xxx.xxx.xx
   ...

>>>>>> usage.url
  1621 /
  1366 /demo/icons.html
  1337 /decode_walk
  ...

Note that this usage.byurl "folds" some directories into a single line.
You can add folding at any time and the summary will reflect the change,
however you cannot unfold once you have folded.  It's pretty easy to figure
out how to add or remove items from the list (it's the first function in
the script.

#! /bin/sh
# This is a shell archive.  Remove anything before this line, then unpack
# it by saving it into a file and typing "sh file".  To overwrite existing

This is the only sane way to deal with "foreign" elements that a browser
can't understand or render itself. The number of object types (pictures,
equations, spreadsheets, movies, etc., open and platform specific picture
formats, different ways of specifying equations, etc. will quickly
overwhelm anyone writing browsers. It also clutters the very simple HTML we
now have. In some cases it may even be possible to translate certain
images, such as FAX data into text, that a browser can handle. 

Digression: Under Windows you could use Dynamic Link Libraries for the
Browser to display data types it does not know about: movies, spreadsheets,
etc. and on the Mac you could also use DLL or AppleEvents.

Subject: link areas within images

Not all clients can display images, but images whether PostScript, GIF,
TeX, etc. will end up being part of many online documents. With that in
mind, I think that we need to be able to specify link areas within image
boundaries, not just the image itself as a link. For example, if you
provide a map image, a browser should support selecting particular
locations within that map image. The simplest way to do this is to specify
a rectangular boundary relative to one corner of the image. Since the image
may be scaled to fit within a browser window, the rectangular link area
would also have to be scaled.

PROPOSAL
I propose using the top left corner of the image as 0,0 (top,left) and
specifying the rectangular areas within the image as top,left,bottom,right
relative to the top left corner of the image, which fits with many of the
existing image models. top,left,bottom,right will be specified as positive
integers (you can't have a link area off the image). If a link area
overlaps another, then the first link area specified in the HTML for the
document would take precedence. Link areas within images should have
several highlighting types, much like Bold, Italics, and Underline for
text, so that link areas on the image can appear transparent to the user (a
rectangular highlight would distract from the rest of the image), some
highlight such as color or brightness change, or have a state showing the
link has been visited. Supporting arbitrary closed polygons as link areas
would require a little more work, but would be a good idea in the long run.

BENEFITS
Besides opening up a large number hypertext applications not currently
possible with HTML because the granularity of image links isn't precise
enough, supporting image links probably avoids some other complexities
threatening HTML. The discussions revolving around PRE and equations
indicate that HTML doesn't provide enough control to produce the kinds of
documents we're used to doing with TeX, FrameMaker, PostScript, etc.
However, those documents, or individual parts of those documents can be
rendered by other applications and returned as images to WWW browsers as
long as areas within those returned images still work as hypertext links. A
rendering application that returns an image, could also return relative
rectangles as valid HTML that would specify the location of a particular
word, phrase, embedded equation, embedded image, etc. dynamically, which
the browser can then add to the HTML for that document while the document
is being viewed.

Subject: HyTime Finite Coordinate Space Locations
Disclaimer: This posting represents the poster's views, not those of IBM
News-Software: Usenet 3.1

A typical problem with online presentation systems is the problem
of defining hyperlink anchors and other things within bitmap
images or other multimedia data notations that have no facility
for defining locations within themselves or that are not revisable.
Most systems I've seen provide some sort of addressing mechanism
that applies a location onto the object.  For example, the IPF
online help system under OS/2 lets you create what it calls an
"art link" by specifying a graphic and then coding in the x and
y locations of a hot spot to create a link anchor.  It works, but
it's particularly transportable or flexible.  HyTime provides a
more general solution to this problem through its finite coordinate
space (FCS) location element (fcsloc).

Fcsloc lets you impose or overlay a coordinate space onto a data
object such that the boundaries of the data object are aligned with
the coordinate space.  To make this works takes a little set up on
the application side, but once the coordinate space is defined, using
an FCSLOC is no more difficult than using any other location mechanism.

The finite coordinate space element (FCS) defines a set of coordinate
axes.  Each axis has a measurement domain associated with it, e.g.,
what system of measurement is used for each axis (inches, seconds,
pixels, etc.).  A "semantic" FCS is defined in the DTD by declaring
an element that conforms to the FCS architectural form.  For example,
to address into graphics, we might define a two-dimensional FCS.

Within the document instance, particular portions of the FCS are defined
by specifying instances of the FCS element defined in the DTD.

Thus, to solve the problem of addressing into images, we first declare
an instance of the FCS form in the DTD itself:

<!ELEMENT GraphicGrid - O (evsched : wand : baton)+ >
<!ATTLIST GraphicGrid
          ID       ID    #IMPLIED
          HyTime   NAME  #FIXED fcs
          axisdefs NAMES #FIXED "xaxis yaxis"
>
<!ELEMENT (xaxis : yaxis) - O (#PCDATA) >
<!ATTLIST (xaxis : xaxis)
          HyTime   NAME  #FIXED axis
          axisdim  CDATA #FIXED "1000"     -- Length of axis  --
          axismeas CDATA #FIXED "gquantum" -- generic quantum --
>

These declarations define the semantic coordinate space GraphicGrid,
which for this example just uses the generic quantum as its measurement
unit, which is fine for overlaying onto graphics of varying resolutions.
To actually use the fcsloc element, however, we have to actually put an
instance of GraphicGrid in our document.  It would look like this:

  <GraphicGrid id=maingrid>
  <evsched><event></event></evsched><GraphicGrid>

For this simple example, the finite coordinate space contains a single
empty event element.  This is because for this example, we aren't
creating an event schedule, but simply defining an FCS to overlay onto a
graphic image, however, the element GraphicGrid has required content,
so I had to put something.

The location source for the fcsloc is a
graphic entity, which is addressed via a nameloc element that associates
an ID with the entity name.  The fcsloc element also refers to the FCS
element and contains the actual address within the FCS being located:

<nameloc id=graphic=object><nmlist entity>a-graphic-entity</nameloc>
<fcsloc locsrc=graphic-object
        impfcs=maingrid>
  <extlist>100 150 200 100
</fcsloc>

The Locsrc= attribute names the object against which the fcsloc is
applied (the location source).  The Impfcs= attribute refers to the FCS
element that defines the grid to overlay onto the object, in this case,
the GraphicGrid element with an id of "maingrid".  The extlist element
contains an "extent list", which is nothing more than a set of
dimension specifications, one for each axis, applied in the order the
axis elements are declared in the Axisdefs= attribute of the FCS
element.

Note that for a special-purpose application like IBMIDDoc, the FCS
element would not have to be actually coded in each document, but could
be defined in the application specification and treated as though it
really did exist, so that in practice, all the author has to specify is
the FCSLOC element.  For interchange with other HyTime applications, the
real FCS element could be generated dynamically or included via entity
reference to an entity shipped as part of the IBMIDDoc package.

Notice that the measurement domain of the FCS is ignored for the
purpose of doing the location.  If I understand it correctly,
the imposed FCS is aligned with the boundaries of the location
source (the graphic in this example).  The dimension spec in the
FCSLOC then effectively defines a proportional part of the FCS,
rather than some absolute measurement.  In other words, if the
FCS's measurement domain was centimeters, and you specified
a dimension of '1 450' thinking you were asking for 450 centimeters,
you would really be addressing some proportion of the FCS,
dependent on the length of each axis (defined with the axisdim=
attribute of the Axis elements).

This behavior makes sense because computer-presented objects
tend not to have meaningful absolute extents.  For example, if
you use a word processor that shows a scale across a document and
labels it as "inches", chances are the ruler on the screen won't match
the ruler in your desk.  Also, it's unlikely that the presentation
system will know how big, in absolute measurements, a given object
thinks it is, as that information will always be notation-specific.

Note also that FCSLOC is really an expedient for systems that
don't support either event schedules or have data notations that
provide ways, in that notation, to define anchor points within
them.  Event schedules do provide the richness of expression to
allow the definition of position within an FCS using absolute
measurements.  For example, instead of imposing a hyperlink
anchor onto a graphic using FCSLOC, I could create an event
schedule that places both the graphic and the hyperlink anchor
on the FCS and thus relates them to each other within the
same coordinate space.

<GraphicGrid><!-- FCS element, contains event schedule -->
 <evsched><!-- Contains events in this coordinate space -->
  <event id=the-graphic
         extent="1 782 1 6687">
  <!-- Contains reference to graphic -->
   <object objectname=my-graphic>
  </event>
  <event id=anchor-in-graphic
         extent="100 150 200 100">
   <refkey linkends="the-graphic text-anchor">Link to something else</>
  </event>
 </evsched>
</GraphicGrid>

With this two-event event schedule, I've placed two objects
within a defined coordinate space, in this case, a graphic
and a link, thereby relating them spatially.  The RefKey element
is also an Ilink element, so it specifies the graphic as one
of its anchors explicitly, even though their occurence within
the schedule also relates it to the graphic.  RefKey is an element
from the IBMIDDoc language.  It has the defined semantic of creating
hyperlinks between multimedia objects and text.

Note also that the elements in the event schedule are references
to other objects, not necessarily objects themselves.  This is a
very powerful aspect of event schedules, because it lets you
position objects without modifying the objects themselves--anything
you can address can be placed in an event schedule by using standard
HyTime location elements to refer to it.

For a real online system to present this event schedule, it first
defines the location of the FCS itself (which might be
defined by another event schedule, see the next discussion), then
interprets each event, placing it on the FCS (in this example, a
two-dimensional grid) according to its defined extent.  It then does
whatever processing is associated with the objects in each event,
e.g., display the graphic and display and manage the hyperlink anchor.
None of these functions are anything most sophisticated online
systems don't already do--we've just expressed the constructs using
a standard notation, HyTime.  Implementing support for this level
of function should be a fairly small delta on top of an existing system
that already provides the presentation functions needed.

Note also that an event could itself be a reference to another
event schedule.  For example, consider the problem of defining
a multimedia presentation consisting of a series of "panels"
organized in time.  You would have one event schedule representing
the main time dimension.  The events in this schedule would be
panel events.  Each panel could be described as a two-dimensional
FCS with the panel objects being events within it.  Consider this
example:

<TimeLine><!-- FCS element with one axis, measured in abstract units -->
 <evshed>
  <event extent="1 1"><!-- For this example, each even takes one
                           quantum since we're just defining order -->
   <panel contentref=panel-1><!-- Uses content of Panel element
                                  defined elsewhere -->
    </event>
    <event extent="1"><!-- Starts at quantum following previous event -->
     <panel contentref=panel-2>
    </event>
  </evsched>
</TimeLine>

You could think of this timeline element as being analogous to
a master document in a DTP system, defining at the highest organizational
level the order of inclusion of the constituent elements of the
presentation, with the added function of defining their extents.

Each panel would itself be an event schedule, this time, either
containing or refering to content objects:

<PanelSpec><!-- FCS element with two axes, measured in abstract units -->
 <evsched>
  <TextBlock extent="10 100 20 236">
  <!-- TextBlock is an event form element, now with the application-
       specific semantic of containing text elements. -->
   <parablock contentref="some-text-data">
    <!-- Refers to some text data marked up with IBMIDDoc elements
         elsewhere.-->
  </TextBlock>
  <ViewPort extent="50 100 60 400"><!-- Also of form event -->
   <MultiMediaObject object=video1>
    <TextAlternative>
     <p>This video shows the following...
    </TextAlternative>
   </MultiMediaObject>
  </Viewport>
  &standard-buttons;<!-- Get standard button events -->
</PanelSpec>

Note that the PanelSpec event schedule is a sort of "style spec" for
the panel, defining not the content, but at least one aspect of its
physical aspect, namely the positions of the elements within the
panel space.  However, in this sort of application, the lines between
style and content start to blur a little.  They could be unblurred in
a concrete application by only allowing reference elements within
events.  Conversely, you could define the panel content language
as a series of event schedules that contain their content directly.
But, the details of the presentation of each panel element, such as
border size, color, etc., would be purely a matter of style.

Note in these examples that I've used normal IBMIDDoc elements as
the content of the panel event schedule.  This is to emphasize both
that IBMIDDoc is capable of applying to multimedia applications and
that the purpose of a multi-media-specific language is to do nothing
more than define the order and position of content within time
and space--there is no need to invent completely new content objects.

Going through these examples has convinced me that scheduling in
HyTime is (or can be) much simpler than it looks at first glance.
I was rather surprised at how easy it was to type in the event
schedules above.  I was also surprised at how similar my "panel"
event schedule is to the structures defined by the IBM Dialog Tag
Language, which provides elements for logically organizing panels
into regions that contain the real content elements (fields, buttons,
text, etc).  Regions are explicit coordinate spaces.  Interesting.

Finally, note the indirection in all of this.  This indirection is
crucial both to the implementation and the flexibility of the system.
It is the indirection of pointing from an event schedule to the
content that makes the system flexible and maintainable.  It will be
the job of multimedia authoring tools to manage this indirection for
writers--that's the really difficult part of authoring in this
environment.  For example, I would expect a multimedia editor to
build these sorts of event schedules under the covers as the author
creates their presentation, including providing an interface for
creating the references from events to actual content elements, as
well as doing the things it already does, such as calculating the
extents of events (e.g., the screen locations of viewports or
windows).

More finally, note that given this sort of HyTime language for
defining the structure of multimedia presentations, there's no
need to have a presentation system that interprets the event
schedules in real time (although that would be nice).  You could
(and probably must in the short term) apply the same technique
that the Dialog Tag Language did, namely, compiling the declarative
source into a run-time form that does not need to be interpreted.
It is important to remember that just because your source is structured
with HyTime, it does not mean your presentation system must understand
HyTime, any more than using SGML for text means your ultimate formatter
has to understand SGML.  It only requires the ability to create processors
that create from the source a runtime object that expresses the structures
in the source.  It is really a question of binding time:  when do you
bind the source to its presentation?  In the near term, the binding
will be early, at the time you compile the deliverable into some
proprietary form (e.g., IPF, ToolBook, etc.).  In the future, the
binding will be as late as possible using true HyTime engines that
interpret the source and create the presentation directly at
presentation time.

TeX/LaTeX is the only way to fly, if we're going to do equations.  A
much larger number of people already know how to use it.

Fine. TeX/eqn are so similar that it really doesn't matter. Functionally, they
are isomorphic and that's what counts. What is important is that either can be
parsed and fed into a symbolic mathematics system and either can express just
about every conceivable collection of equations. With TeX supporting
equations, you would have an incredibly powerful system. Yes, the viewers
would be bigger in terms of lines of code. But consider what you could achieve
with them and I think it's worth it.

Thanks, Torben

Subject: WWW Developer's Conference

	Announcement:	World-Wide Web Wizards Workshop
	===============================================
	
Dale Dougherty of O'Reilly & Associates and
Tim Berners-Lee of CERN are organizing a technical workshop for
W3 software developers.   We have worked out the following
dates for the workshop, to be held in Cambridge, MA. 

	Wednesday July 28 1993
		to
	Friday July 30 1993

Depending on the turnout, we plan to 
meet at the office of O'Reilly & Associates.

The workshop is an opportunity to bring together developers 
who have been working on WWW-related code and who have had
only email (and web) contact with each other.  

A principal aim will be to discuss development priorities,
especially developments in HTTP and (to a lesser extent) HTML.
Features being added to the public domain code library, and
the basic servers, will be under discussion, for example

	- Authentication and Accounting
	- Naming schemes (URNs and machinery behind them)
	- Style sheet mechanisms
	- Negotiation of document representations,
		character sets, etc in HTTP
	- Interactive objects
	- Software needs of Internet service providers
	
The workshop will not be a tutorial for beginners;
it will be organized as a discussion forum for developers.
The objective is to establish common direction for
Web development, so that developers can benefit from
the work others are doing.

We would also like to have some discussions among those
with an informed managerial perspective on the current
and future directions of the web, and its organization. 

Those who are interested in attending, please email dale@ora.com.

We'd like to get a sense of how many people are coming
to ensure that we have enough space.
We will will distribute additional information, in particular
hotel information and directions, to the www-talk alias.

Subject: launching executables through HTML files
X-Md4-Signature: c3fdd0628372843f7da12b891ce49e09

What's the current status on the idea of allowing hyperlinks in HTML
documents to cause executables to be launched?  

For various reasons, we're about ready to give into our previous
resistance to this whole idea and try to allow, under some
circumstances, local executables to be launched via hyperlinks in
Mosaic.

Didn't someone suggest an exec: URL type, or something like that?

Some users I have talked to in the past have suggested allowing
another application to actually control the launching of a specified
command: the browser would fork off this (more or less trusted)
application which could perform verification, testing of pathnames, or
whatever before giving the user a dialog box that would allow the
command to actually be launched.  Would this be a widely applauded
idea or should the browser just handle things itself (throw up the
command in a dialog box and say, "OK buddy, yes or no?")?

Also, there was the idea that maybe executables should only be allowed
to be launched from documents residing on the local host (not over
ftp, http, or anything else).  This seems like a pretty much useless
restriction with the current state and expansion of transparent
networked filesystems, though.

Cheers,
Marc

I think you should be able to configure the browser as to what MIME types
it should handle and which get passed to an external program.  Something
like the following (for X applications anyway):

XMosaic*contentTranslations: \
    		#override			\n\
    text/html:	text_html()			\n\
    text/*:	text_plain()			\n\
    image/gif:	image_gif()			\n\
    image/jpg:	image_jpg()			\n\
    image/*:	exec(xv)			\n\
    video/mpg:	exec(mpeg_play -loop)		\n\
    audio/*:	exec(audio_play)		\n\
    exec/*:	verify_exec() exec(exec_handler)\n\
    */*:	unknown()

The #override means replace the translation table completely,
otherwise do a merge.

Can anyone see that having a URL "exec:..." is better than simply
groking "content-type: exec/*"?  I think using content-type is
better because the "....:" part of a URL should specify how to
retrive the data, not what to do with it.

The reason I've held off doing that in general, believe it or not, is
because I'm not sure what method to use.  I'd rather not invent a new
method.  I may use mailcaps (RFC 1343).  ?

Except that one thing you're never going to do (at least, that I'm
never going to want to let you do :-) is to actually retrieve
executables over the net.  If you look at it from the point of view
that the access method of a URL describes the process to be used to
fetch data, then you could say that could be (a) a network protocol or
(b) a local executable, without violating the metaphor.

I dunno... I still don't like the idea of firing off arbitrary
executables on the client side, so I'm not gonna strenuously argue
either way.

I take it by your use of the exec/* content type that the command to
be executed would be in the data part of the message element and not
in the subtype field of the content type, though, right?

Subject: Re: launching executables through HTML files

There was some talk of this on comp.infosystems.www.  I think
executable data in a document is a different issue from execution
of local programs.  For code in a document you not only have to
trust the server but you have to agree on what code is -- pretty
difficult across UNIX boxes, never mind throwing MS-DOS, VMS and
MacOS on top of that.  Given the compatibility and trust problems,
you probably wouldn't accept code from anything but a local server
who could just as well point you to an NFS file.

The best suggestion for local program execution was to extend the
file: scheme.  If the URL points to an executable file and that
file is in your access control list, then it is executed and the
output format is know from the .suffix.  In addition, arguments
can be passed to the executable with a magic delimiter ('%/' was
suggested).

So, if you get "file:/usr/local/rn.html%/news/comp/sources/misc",
it will run "/usr/local/rn.html /news/comp/sources/misc".  Assuming,
say, that "/usr/local" is in your "WWWPATH" environment variable.

I'm already using my own version of local program executing URLs
for a newsreader with history and some other stuff.  I'd love to
see this stuff made official so I can distribute these.

I disagree, you can do this just as well with the methods I've pointed
out using Content-type: and it doesn't require ugly hacks to the browser
(since you already have to deal with handing different content-types off
to the correct external program, adding another type should be clean,
hacking file: isn't).  **Plus** using content-type doesn't require that
you encode the command as a URL (Ugh).

Content-type: exec/x-local

/usr/local/rn.html /news/comp/sources/misc

The browser goes, oh exec/x-local.  I'll hand that off to such-and-such,
the it can decide if /usr/local/rn.html is safe or not.

Well, arguably this is just as messy.  But, believe it or not, I don't
care as long as it will do the job.  I'm probably missing something
about the MIME structure of things, but don't you still need some
sort of URL to get the ball rolling (and keep it rolling)?  Can you
actually say something like:

	Other <A HREF=
	Content-type: exec/x-local

	/usr/local/rn.html /newsgrouplist
	>newsgroups</A>

(Or some syntactically correct variant).  Just to be clear, here's how I
see the file: hack equivalent:

	Other <A HREF=file:/usr/local/rn.html%/newsgrouplist>newsgroups</A>

It would seem some kind of URL hack is necessary, no?

You'd want, let's see...

Other <A HREF="foobar.mime">newsgroups</A>

Where foobar.mime contained...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content-type: exec/x-local

/usr/local/rn.html /newsgrouplist
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...or something like that.  I guess.  (Somebody yell at me if I'm
wrong.)

HTML+ has a style attribute for the PRE tag with just such ideas in mind:

<!-- Preformatted text with fixed pitch font,
     respecting original spacing and newlines.
     The style attribute allows authors to specify
     alternative styles, e.g. "poem" which browsers
     could render in a proportional font.
 -->
<!ELEMENT PRE - - (%text;)+>
<!ATTLIST PRE
    id      ID      #IMPLIED -- link destination --
    style   CDATA   #IMPLIED -- various styles --
    width   NUMBER  #IMPLIED -- e.g. 40, 80, 132 -->

My expectation is there are a small number of useful styles for which we can
agree on the names and how to render them. One problem with using a CDATA
(free text) field for style names is that browsers may not recognise less
common ones. It seems to me that it is worth breaching the principle of
presentation independence slightly to include some rendering hints to allow
for graceful degradation. With this in mind I am now considering adding a
justification attribute to the paragraph tag <P>, e.g. <P CENTER>, together
with a line break tag <BR>.

A wider issue is changing character sets, e.g. from Latin-1 to Old English
(or at a more mundane level to Asian character sets).

Switching to 16 bit fonts will help (at least for extant languages). However,
I see no real alternative in the longer term to building in support for
outline fonts, e.g. TrueType, together with full support for the ISO entity
definitions.

I am exploring what it means to make HTML+ HyTime compatible. Elliot
Kimber (IBM) is helping me in this regard. It definitely looks an
important issue for the long term viability of HTML.

    I am currently writing the hypertext doc to a class library
which I want to be fully transparent for the public. Thus, I
prepared an image of the Class Inheritance Tree with neat
boxes. I thought I'd use the ISMAP feature [I have XMosaic v1.1
for SGI-Irix4d]: I followed your demo, i.e. I have a file which
contains
                                                        <xmp>
<A HREF="./decodeMGLIB"><IMG SRC="MGLIB-all.gif" ISMAP>
</A>
                                                        </xmp>
and in the same dir a file
                                                        <xmp>
/decodeMGLIB
                                                        </xmp>
containing
                                                        <xmp>
<A HREF="/decodeMGLIB?90,400">ISU</A>
<A HREF="/decodeMGLIB?180,299">MultiGrid</A>
                                                        </xmp>
Now, only if I accidentally hit the right coordinates,
(90,400) or (180,299), I get the wanted answer, written to files
named
                                                        <xmp>
/decodeMGLIB?90,400
/decodeMGLIB?180,299
                                                        </xmp>

respectively, while for other coordinates, I get the error:
                                                        <XMP>

                                                        </XMP>
In his reply, Tony Sanders (sanders@bsdi.com)
who contributed this feature said he did not even know the
CERN httpd supported it. Tony also writes:
                                                        <PRE>
  What Mosaic
  should be passing to the server for your example
  would be:

  GET /decode?xxx,yyy

  It's the job of the server to decode the xxx,yyy
  coords and translate that to some document.

  > these are the upper right corners of subimages

  I would imagine that you have to describe both corners,
  and I'll bet it's the upper-left and lower-right, not
  upper-right but that's just a guess.
                                                        </PRE>
Now, I dont know whether this quote helps, but maybe one or the
other wizard at CERN, or an XMosaic expert knows the answer.

So why don't we lobby Adobe to put in URL based links into its next version
of Postscript and go home now?

Seriously - how much interest is there in a non-proprietary, lightweight
extendable format derived from HTML? Am I barking up the wrong tree with
HTML+ ?

You'll need indeed a special server, that knows about your
document and how to decode it.
It is not simply a matter of creating the right files and
expect things to work.
I *do* want ISMAP or equivalent support, but the links should go into
the document, not on some specialized server that handles your docs.

I have the HyTime standard in front of me, and on first reading it is
impressive in terms of what it tries to cover.  Much of it is
impenetrable, but I hope another pass through it will clarify my
understanding a bit.

But a word of caution.  In at least two different places I have read
that HyTime was designed for the INTERCHANGE of hypermedia data, and
that it is not necessarily a good choice for an efficient run-time
hypermedia format.  Of course, it may well be that the overhead
associated with HyTime is small compared with the network overhead for
multimedia data transfer - but we should be aware of the problem. 

Making WWW HyTime-compatible does not bring any immediate benefits. 
Maybe it would make the job of client developers easier if there was a
public-domain HyTime engine available - but until there is, it is
difficult to argue for.

Despite the above, I am keen that WWW should move in this direction. 
HyTime appears to provide a good deal of flexibility.  You could simply
view it as a collection of useful ideas with which to design hypermedia
applications - and nothing is lost by building in HyTime compatability.

Ok,  I have made a more recent but very buggy app avaialble.
It can't edit -- try and it will destroy your files!
  But you can browse. No embedded graphics unfortunately.

Your development proposal sounds great..... if you are in a position  
to enhance the NeXT editor, then we could come to an arrangement...

Here is the corrent README from ftp://info.cern.ch/

	THE EDITOR

WorldWideWeb_0.16.tar.Z is the only wysiwyg hypertext editor for the
NeXT.  It has limitations and bugs -- it can't access Gopher, FTP  
sites,
etc.  But it is a hypertext editor!

Note this app is compiled for NextStep 3.0 and won't work with 2.1.
There is no way round this; don't ask!  (The Project file is
converted by the ProjectBuilder to a version 3 project file
when you first compile for version 3.  The version 3 project
file won't work with 2.0 (Interface builder and project builder
shared a file and an app in 2.x), and so there is no going back!
The 3.x app won't work under 2.x as it needs 3.x shared libaries.)


	THE BROWSER

The file labelled 1.0 is a pre-alpha browser which uses the libwww
library, so you can get multimedia files etc etc.  Does doc
format conversion, etc.  


THE EDITOR DOES NOT WORK.  NOT SUPPORTED....
Only for the curious.  This DOES handle Gopher, FTP, etc.

Sorry they have the same icon now ... can be very confusing
if you use both.

Subject: NeXT client

Sorry if I am covering ground covered elsewhere (FAQ's), but I  
thought this might be an appropriate forum for my questions.

I am investigating the possibility of using WWW as the central app  
for our proposed electronic library system (Xel - Xavier electronic  
library).  Having come here recently (2 months ago) from a  
CD-ROM/Hypertext company, WWW appeals to me for a number of reasons.   
I have also worked with various _SGML_, or _SGML-like_ engines (OWL  
Guide, CDAuthor Hypertext, KRS, PLS, Hyperwriter, WorldView, IDEAS,  
Mark-It, etc) and would like to build on that.

The library has four NeXT machines, which will form the seed of the  
system, and they will be the platform where capabilities of the Web  
are first demonstrated (I hope).  I would like to prepare a demo of a  
home page providing access to regional resources (ie. telnet'ing to  
other library catalogues, ftp sites, etc) sometime in the next few  
weeks. 


I realize the latest version (0.16) of the NeXT Hypermedia  
Browser/Editor does not support telnet, gopher, etc., but I would  
like to use the NeXT for these early demos if possible.  Besides, I  
am new to NeXT, love it, and would like to use it for document  
creation/development. Once I get into the development environment in  
more detail I would be interested in helping in any way I can with  
the NeXT WWW app.

- Does anybody have a NeXT browser that supports these functions, or  
is there a way to telnet from the current version in some way? 


- If not, I have recently loaded MouseX for X11R5 - does anybody have  
any experience with Viola or other X11 apps using this version?   
Should I obtain a different X app for NeXT that has been proven with  
some of these? 


- I have also recently loaded the Cello app, but would like to stay  
away from DOS/Windows if possible for now.

I appreciate any info you may be able to provide, and am looking  
forward to working with WWW and the Web development community.

Thanks

I was thinking of making a new algorithm for finding a home page --
to first try, at machine fred.dep.uni.edu

	http://www.dep.uni.edu/			and then
	http://www.uni.edu/			and then
	http://www.edu/				and then
	some basic home page.
	
There are quite a lot of places where this will give something
now.  Sounds alike an easy default for people who might
pick up the software and not know that there is in fact a local
server.  It will ease admin and promote more servers.

The search would be only in the DNS of couse, if they don't
exist. If one of these is found, it could also by default be
used as a site server.

Whadya think?

Kevin, you make like to look at HTML+ and how it supports figures using an
element specifying rectangular regions within the image and a URL to
traverse when the user clicks on this part of the image. The image data
is specified as either a URL or via embedded data on a non-HTML+ format (e.g.
for Adobe Illustrator drawings). This work is based on Pei Wei's experimental
DTD "HMML" and provides an alternative to making the server do all the work.

The coordinate scheme is (0,0) for the upper left corner to (1,1) for the
lower right. Scaled coordinates are used because pixel based coordinates are
inappropriate for drawings.

p.s. the HTML+ DTD is at  ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/dev/htmlplus.dtd.txt

FYI: this is a lot easier in the next Plexus (2.2 coming soon).  You just
create a file that describes your image, you can use a combination of
bitmasks and rectangles to set all the hot spots.  Hopefully, I'll have
time at some point to write an X based app that pops up your image and
lets you set all the hot spots then writes out all the necessary data.
e.g., Here is all the data you have to generate for the space walk demo:
    walk default server/walk/default.html
    walk bitmask server/walk/astronaut.mask 106 110 server/walk/astronaut.html
    walk bitmask server/walk/camera.mask 106 110 server/walk/camera.html
    walk bitmask server/walk/earth.mask 106 110 server/walk/earth.html
    walk bitmask server/walk/pack.mask 106 110 server/walk/pack.html
    walk rect 0 0 106 110 server/walk/space.html

Look at the FIGA stuff in HTML+.  I think we've pretty well established
that both are desirable.  ISMAP just happens to be the best solution
for existing browsers.

Dave,

In my opinion, HyTime is not a useful direction for
WWW at this time.  It will require a lot of effort just to
understand, and even more to implement on a basic level.  As
part of the Davenport Group, I spent more than a year
investigating HyTime for possible use in Docbook DTD and other
online publishing activities.  I did not see broad support
for HyTime, as a standard or as technology.  I
decided that HyTime was not something to be used by our
current or next generation of technology. I was also very
frustrated that HyTime exists only on paper, and so anyone
can say anything about it without proving it in practice.

You have to separate out the claims made for HyTime and the technology
or applications required to make use of it.  Most people
who talk HyTime do not bother to distinguish between the two
and they tend to trivialize the impact on applications. 
Remember, there are no HyTime engines available anywhere
and until there are no one can prove or disprove their claims.
When someone says "HyTime allows you to do ....", probe for
specifics.  Ask how it works.

You will also have trouble figuring out whether HyTime is
a standard syntactical representation for hypermedia constructs
or a way of life.  If the latter, then you have to
start living that way now, or be lost.  (And that's why
most HyTime advocates urge you to accept HyTime now.)  If it is just
a standard representation of the kind of things we are already
doing, then the door is always open to use that syntax,
should it emerge as something of value.  

HyTime is intended to be an interchange standard, and its
awkward syntax is not meant to be processed in real-time.
If you study the standard, you will find out that for
the most part, its method of standard representation involves
putting a standard "wrapper" around application-specific info.  
So, for instance, it allows HyTime apps to identify links 
in a standard way, but it does not make the link addressing used in
applications interoperable.  In WWW, we use URLs for link addressing
and if we send an HTML document to another 
hypermedia application, the tough part to interchange is the URL.
If the target app does not understand URLs, the document is
pretty useless.  All HyTime would do is put the URL in 
a standard wrapper indicating that the tag contained link information.  

We should be aware of HyTime -- there are some challenging
ideas in it that go way beyond linking. However, we should
not ignore the absence of HyTime-based technology -- none was 
developed to test the specification as part of the standardization 
process. If you take the view that
HyTime offers a standard representation for hypermedia documents, 
then we should be able to convert HTML documents into
a form that is HyTime-compliant for the purpose of interchanging
documents with other HyTime-supporting apps,
(which do not yet exist).   As long as our focus is
on creating documents to be used in the Web, 
we don't need to be encumbered by HyTime syntax, much
less by the HyTime way of thinking.  Anyone who feels HyTime
is important is free to manage his information using
HyTime-compliant DTDs and then create HTML versions of
those documents for the Web.  We do not need it as a way
to interchange documents among Web browsers and create
interoperable links; we have that
level of standardization right now, and we have something
that works.

I am still exploring what it means to make HTML+ HyTime compliant
or compatible. It is really a matter of conforming to some of the
architectural ideas in HyTime. We don't need to take on board
everything HyTime includes. In some cases we might want to provide
a HyTime compliant alternative when the normal HTML approach is
incompatible with HyTime. There is no pressure to adopt features
that would penalise an efficient run-time hypermedia format. 

At its simplest, we could provide support for hypertext references
via entity declarations following the CLINK and NOTLOC model. This
means you could declare all the references at the start of the
document, and then use local names throughout the body of the
document where ever you need a hypertext reference.

With WYSIWYG editors this wouldn't be too much of a pain. The HREF
attribute would remain as now, but there would be an alternative
that assumes local names and which is HyTime compliant.

Much of this involves some extra attributes of interest only when
trying to get another HyTime compliant system to make sense of an
HTML+ document. It wouldn't effect HTML+ browsers significantly.

Other aspects of HyTime can be included as additions to the DTD as
a bridge to the future when HyTime location ladders and finite
coordinate space elements become useful.

Regards,

Dave Raggett

Lots and nope.  I think you're doing a great job with HTML,
particularly in that HTML+ will greatly enhance the capabilities of
WWW systems; it will get a lot of use and I look forward to supporting
it, as I've said before.  But I would think that whether or not SGML
had anything to do with it or not, and I think it will be useful
to more people if SGML isn't allowed to philosophically restrict it
(similar to the way HTML became more useful with <I> and <B>).

Cheers,
Marc

Versions 2.07 of the library and the line mode browser have been

My questions:

1) will the sources be published, too?

2) does this version already include the WAIS-WWW gateway functionality?
	(if I am not totally mistaken this was hinted at by TBL...)

3) if the WAIS-WWW gateway is not included in 2.07, could some kind soul
	please point me to a source? We need to set one up for our
	internal use (and thus can't rely on `external' gateways - not
	to speak of the bottleneck of our feeble internet connection)

Thank you very much indeed!

  Can you say Acrobat?  Adobe Acrobat is a new product from abobe which
includes, among other things, the successor to postscript, PDF (Portable
Document Format).  PDF is essentially postscript with embedded structure,
including hyperlinks.

Some of you have already discovered there is a new experimental World
Wide Web Server running at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Palo
Alto, California.  The address is pubweb.parc.xerox.com. See:

<A HREF="http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com:80/">Xerox PARC PubWeb Server</A>

Currently the only documents available are via a custom map rendering
service -- yet another experiment in providing dynamic information
retrieval via World Wide Web.

The Map Viewer is implemented as as a perl script that accepts requests
for map renderings (encoded as URLs) and returns HTML documents
including a Mosaic-style inlined GIF image of the requested map. It
does not yet take advantage of the Mosaic extensions for detecting
mouse positions within an image.

Eventually we may use this server to publish some general information
about PARC and perhaps provide access to published PARC technical
reports.

From my limited understanding of HyTime, I believe this is correct - 
there is no way you could take a document from one HyTime system and
expect to import it into another HyTime system without change.  But the
task is much _easier_ if both systems are HyTime compliant.

Let's summarise the advantages and disadvantages of adding HyTime CLINKs
to HTML+.

Advantage:

 * Easier to import information from other HyTime-compliant systems, or
   from systems which export information in HyTime-compliant format (of
   which there are currently none).

Disadvantages:

 * Two alternative ways of doing the same thing leads to lack of
   clarity in the DTD.

 * Added complexity in browser code (which would have to support both
   styles of link, and wouldn't have a HyTime engine to help - yet).

On this one it seems to me that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages -
HyTime CLINKs are not the way to go for HTML+.

However, Dale also says:

> there are some challenging ideas in [HyTime] that go way beyond linking.

Could the ideas in HyTime's measurement module and the concept of a FCS
help in defining hot spots within an image?  There would be no
disadvantages associated with multiple ways of doing things.

I'd also like to explore how HyTime constructs could be used to express
synchronisation relationships between documents.

On one or two things I want to take issue with Dale:

Did you reject HyTime simply based on these reasons, or were there
specific technical issues which you objected to? If so, I'm interested
to know what they were.

The Davenport Group certainly went on to use HyTime in their SOFABED
spec.

HyTime-based technology _is_ being developed.

HTML+ will need testing and changing before it is finished.  We should
not be afraid to add bits of HyTime to HTML+ if it looks sensible to do so.
If it doesn't work, it can be replaced.

Most network file systems still appear to be local accesses so this IS
still a valid idea.  I think it is unreasonable to expect users to be
able to make reasonable judgements about how a particular command might
effect there system.  Do YOU really think that there is no one clever
enough to fool YOU with some cryptic UNIX trojan link.  The average
user isn't competant enough to tell whether some command will destroy
his system, therefore tight control should be exercised with this
link type.  Another issue is how can a single executable link be useful
on other systems?  Why should a machine specific link be usable across
the network?  We are playing with fire with this link type, I know this
from experience.

My suggestion would be to allow "exec:" type links to be run only if
the file that contains them resides on the local filesystem.  (physical,
NFS, AFS, etc.)  Or a file that resides on a trusted host. (in a list?)  
That way there is at least some sense of security.

Since when was AFS a "local" file system? I do not regard arbitrary
files in AFS as trustworthy in the least.

Can we have coordinates the way everyone does then, i.e. 0,0 is in  
the BOTTOM LEFT and 1,1 is at the TOP RIGHT.
PostScript works that way, maths work that way, etc.
ONLY for character grid personal computers is an inverted vertical  
axis used, so as to add a line space for each new line instead of  
having to subtract it. This was a frig, and I hope we can avoid

Yes, they are there .. but 2.09 is out in binary and that

for changes between versions.

Yes it does.  You just have to set compile options and
also link with the freeWAIS libraries.  Allows direct
WAIS access by WWW clients and allows your httpd to
function as a WAIS gateway.

Subject: WWW Developer's Conference

So far we have about 15 people coming to the WWW Developer's
Conference, July 28 to July 30, 1993.  We will meet 9-5 on
those days at:

O'Reilly & Associates
90 Sherman Street 
Cambridge, MA 02140
617-354-5800

Here's the closest, cheapest hotel.  There are others
in Cambridge, of course, but this is fairly close to
the office.  The hotel is within walking distance (< 1/2 mile) of the
subway station (MBTA Red Line, Alewife Station).

Best Western Homestead
220 Alewife Parkway
Cambridge, MA  
(617) 491-8000

The rates I'm able to get for now:

$72 - single/night
$79 - double/night
$84 - triple/night

This rate is dependent on our reserving a block of rooms.
So, if you plan to stay at this hotel, please let me
know and we will take care of the reservations for
you.  

Thanks, 

Dale

Of course, PostScript got this wrong in a lot of ways---for the
majority of users of PostScript, their language reads left to right,
top to bottom.  In particular, this causes problems when printing on
pages of different sizes.  You often see this when moving from A4 to
US Letter size, where things tend to get cut off because 0,0 is too
close to the bottom of the page.

Also note that much cruft was installed in Display PostScript to allow
flipped coordinate systems where 0,0 is top left.

I don't see this as a big issue, but most of the text we're likely to
have in the web reads top-to-bottom, so I don't wanna deal with
inverting coordinates a second time...

Subject: libwww 2.09: Executable documents and binary FTP


The just released incremental version of the WWW common
code library addresses two things recently discussed on
this list. One is the selection of the proper transfer mode
for FTP, and the other is how to make executable scripts.

The problem with FTP is that the client MUST select the
correct mode (Ascii or Image) wheras the server (presumably)
knows what the format is. The client guesses the content-type
from the file suffix.  It now also guesses the encoding
as well.  It will therefore select A for .txt files and I
for .Z files, and so get the right results even with
Macs and non-ASCII servers around.  The suffix table
can be set up in the client's rule file, if it is used with
one.

The executable scripts problem I viewed as another format
negotiation problem.  It is easier to set up the suffix table
and the command you want executed for given content types.
Its all in the rule file.  If you are rash enough to put in

   presentation   application/x-csh   "csh %s"

into your client rule file, then you can try out the
example script in the test data linked to the
test page ... 
http://www3.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Test/Executable/test1.execme.csh
if I remember rightly.

Obviously this is just a hook.  A script which previews it or
at least asks would be more reasonable.

I used application/x-csh rather than inventing exec/x-csh as I
think this is more in the MIME spirit.
The competition is obviously on for portable
1. safe scripting language for general use
2. timed presentation language (HyTime based?) for
   illustrated talks which give themselves.

I seem to have got off the topic of the release...
Other things...
Of course I would expect X clients to load rules from the
Xresource database too -- by calling HTSetConfiguration().
Similarly other platform-specific sources of initilisation
information.

I have just been asked to do a book proposal on the new generation of
Internet tools, those that depend on global connectivity and fairly
highspeed links.  I will be featuring browsers such as Mosaic, Xwais,
and Cello, and innovative audio/video/multimedia packages such as CUCME,
Netjam, MBONE multicasting, etc.  I am looking for pointers to programs
and applications, preferably in the public domain or shareware, that
are beginning to tap the promise of the Internet-- I would love to do
a chapter on collaboration and visualization tools such as the NCSA tools
and the EVL stuff, for instance.

I am also looking for pointers to the latest work in mobile and nomadic
computing; I have some info already but this is a very good place to ask. :-)

I would appreciate any pointers to new, interesting, or unusual Internet
applications that do browsing, audio or video (especially in realtime
or something quite like it), collaboration or shared work environments
without physical presence, and so on.  You get the idea.   I have a bit
of a list already, but I *know* there are things out there that I haven't
heard of yet.  Even if they're not going to be released until later in 
the year, or are still internal research projects at your university,
if it will be possible to ftp sources or binaries before January of 94
and start messing with it, I want to hear about it!  Here's your chance
at notoriety.  

I am turning in a preliminary list of chapters Friday by 5pm PST; this
will of course mutate wildly over the course of the book (I'm a realist,
even if this is my first book project) but the more things I can mention
the better chance it has of being approved.  I only need a brief synopsys
of your project to include a line or two about it in the proposal.  If
what you are developing has not been announced yet, please let me know
and I will note that, ie. "this tool is being developed at a large university
which shall remain nameless until the announcement in September".

I am not interested in commercial products at this time unless they
represent an extension or enhancement to public domain or shareware tools
(eg., the custom browser clients being developed by WAIS Inc).

Thanks for any info you can give me!  And to forestall the flood of
"I don't have anything to tell you about but really want your list"
letters, I *will* be posting a synopsys of said tools to the groups
who've received this message.

Cheers,

You are certainly not too late!

The current mechanism is uses the browser to recognise when the user
clicks with the mouse over an active region of the image/drawing:

<!-- Figure anchors designate rectangular areas on the
    figure which can be clicked with the mouse. The units
    are scaled from 0.0 to 1.0 for each axis. The default
    area is the whole of the figure. This mechanism
    interprets mouse clicks locally.
-->

<!ELEMENT FIGA - O (EMPTY)>
<!ATTLIST FIGA
    href    %URL;   #REQUIRED   -- link to traverse when clicked --
    x1      NUMBER  #IMPLIED    -- left in range 0 to 1 --
    y1      NUMBER  #IMPLIED    -- top in range 0 to 1 --
    x2      NUMBER  #IMPLIED    -- right in range 0 to 1 --
    y2      NUMBER  #IMPLIED    -- bottom in range 0 to 1 -->

To supported polygons as regions, we need a way of specifying a list of
points. The obvious way is as a comma separated list of numbers:

The following is a triangle: (0.2, 0.3) (0.23, 0.33) (0.15, 0.31)


        "0.2,0.3,0.23,0.33,0.15,0.31"  as  x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...

> some kind of highlight on the client site is needed, so if the user moves
> the mouse over the wall (the line) it lights up or something equivalent, so
> the user can see: 'he, this part of the wall does something, lets see it' or
> 'hmm this part af the wall is connected to the part on the other side of the
> chimney, and I have seen that already. lets skip this link'

As far as I can see, the browser can handle all this automatically, without
any need for additional information. It could even examine the URL associated
with each region to select a mouse cursor appropriate to the type of linked
information, e.g. musical notes for sound sequences.

The new version of FIGA would look like:

<!ELEMENT FIGA - O (EMPTY)>
<!ATTLIST FIGA
    href   %URL;    #REQUIRED   -- link to traverse when clicked --
    area   NUMBERS  #IMPLIED    -- x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,... -->
    
The ISMAP mechanism with XMosaic's IMG tag gets the server to process mouse
clicks, and hence can offer greater flexibility than a static collection of
polygonal areas handled by the client, e.g. the active regions could vary
with time in shape and effect.

<!ELEMENT FIG - - (EMBED?, FIGA*, (%text;)*)>
<!ATTLIST FIG
    id      ID      #IMPLIED
    float  (float)  #IMPLIED -- fixed or floating figures --
    ismap  (ismap)  #IMPLIED -- mouse clicks handled by server --
    src     %URL;   #IMPLIED -- link to image data -->

The coordinates for clicks are measured in the same units as FIGA rather than
IMG's pixel values which can't cope with objects such as drawings for which
the pixel extent will vary from one browser to the next in an unpredictable
way.

Example:

    <fig ismap src="http://chem.rug.nl/geo/nl.gif">
        Major population centers in the Nederlands
    </fig>

A mouse click over a city is sent to the server as:

        "http://chem.rug.nl/geo/nl.gif?X,Y"

with X and Y replaced by numbers in the range from 0 to 1.

In theory authors could combine both techniques. Clicks over areas defined
with the FIGA tag are handled locally, while clicks over other parts of the
image are sent to the server.

Does this seem OK?

Which servers have the ability to deny connections based on hostname?
ie

	host	/local/*	*	fail

would only allow *.nz access to anything in /local and everyone else
would be refused.

I ask, because it is a simple step to go from this to

	kdomain	/www/sensitive/staff/*	staff

to define kerberos demesne for files in various locations and do away

I've just played with Xerox PARCs world map, and been following the
discussion of hot spots with images, and arbitrary polygon hotspots.

It occurs to me to ask whether the various mechanisms described can
handle sending an arbitrary region of the image, e.g. could my broswer
permit me to draw an outline of the region (e.g. Europe on the world
map) I want, then send back a URL for map?X1,Y1+X2,Y2.

This seems to be a reasonable requirement, but I haven't seen it
explictly describe in the correspondence so far.

That sounds fine by me. Does anyone else think otherwise?

It's not just character grid PCs, most bitmapped displays (e.g. X11,
Mac) do it it this way, too.  My choice would depend on the kind of
coordinate system to be used; if it were directly related to pixels,
let Y point down, but if you normalize to e.g. [0.0, 1.0] then Y would
best point up, in correspondence with standard graph conventions.
(Just trying to settle the argument with facts instead of personal
feelings...)

The # is a delimiter which separates the opaque part of the
URL which is passed to the server from the opaque part of
the URL which is passed to the displaying application.
There is no way you can pass a URL containing # to a server,
as that is precicely what it does not mean.

If you want to make a special world around tar files, then
do, but use valid characters. If you want to avoid using
things which might crop up in the file names, then the %
character is there which with non hex characters gives
all sorts of combinations -- like %/ mentioned before to
mean "interpret that which is on the left with respect to
that which is on the left".  You could use this for
tar files too, in your server:

	/docs/foo.tar%/bar.c		extraction
	/docs/foo.tar%L			listing
	/docs/foo.tar%LR		deep listing
	/docs/foo.tar			the file itself

for example.  Remember that this string will be passed
straight to the server and the client is not allowed
to interpret it at all. The bit to the right of the #
is the reverse: it is never passed to the server,
only the client (the presentation app) can interpret it.

They are different.  Some servers return the same thing for the
two different URLs.  I am not sure which browsers actually support
an empty search string. I agreee it is logical to do so.  You should
NOT assume any convenmtion for what it means. For example,
if the server ANDs its terms, you might expect he catalogue, while
if it ORs them you would expect nothing back.  If you want to
make the catlogue available, it is MUCH better to make a link
to it from the index cover page.

The latest Hytelnet database is available on the web. Point
any W3 browser (Cello, Mosaic, tkWWW, MacWeb, etc etc) at
http://info.cern.ch.:8002/w3start.txt
or follow links to "Servers by type" and chose "Telnet".
It's also in the Mosaic "documents" menu.

Here are details of the changes from Peter Scott:

			---------------------
			
HYTELNET version 6.5, the database which gives an WWW user
instant-access to all Internet-accessible library catalogs,
FREE-NETS, CWISs, BBSs, Gophers, WAIS, etc. is now available. 


Version 6.5 is a major upgrade. Much redundant information has been
deleted, and errors have been corrected. Also all the new/updated
files created since Version 6.4 have been incorporated.
Certain files have been renamed to match their domain names.

I would like to see this also, exactly as peter described it (using
+ to seperate each x,y pair).  What we really need to define are the
semantics for the browser ISMAP="point" rect poly???  I'm not sure how
to do this in a generic way (do we also need "sound" "video"??).
Maybe instead of telling the browser the type of selection the browser
should tell the server:  http://server/europe?poly+x,y+x,y...

But maybe the ISMAP should still have a hint about what's expected?

> Which servers have the ability to deny connections based on hostname?

Actually, Plexus has something like this but it was just a quick hack
to play around with (it uses IP numbers right now, like I said it was
just a quick hack).

It's http://www.bsdi.com/server/account.pl if anyone wants to play around
with it and make it work right.

>>>>>>>

While I'm at it I'll announce Plexus 2.2-Beta which can be had from
ftp://austin.bsdi.com/pub/Plexus-2.2-beta.tar.Z		(old tar format)
ftp://austin.bsdi.com/pub/Plexus-2.2-beta.pax.Z		(new ustar format)

I'm running this on www.bsdi.com now and it seems to be doing just fine.
Notable changes are image decoding is much better (you just define a
configuration file *and* it supports rectangles, thanks to Chris McRae
for doing this).  Also, Plexus 2.2-beta is ready to support format
negotiation, I include a setext -> HTML converter (it currently doesn't
negotiate, it just converts).  It still needs work in this area but it
should be pretty easy to add new converters.

Let me know soon if you have any problems, I'll be releasing it soon.

I really think you'll like the new image decoding stuff that Chris did,
it's quite easy to add image decoding now.

Changes to Plexus from Previous Versions
========================================

Plexus 2.2
----------

* added support for document translation (lots of changes in dir.pl)
* added setext.pl to convert from setext (.etx) to HTML
* added better image decoding support thanks to Chris McRae
  <mcrae@ckm.ucsf.edu>.  You can now specify image decoding
  in a configuration file ($MAP_CONFIG_FILE) and you can use
  bitmasks or rectangles.  In most cases you don't have to write
  any code!  Things like bookmark are more complicated and still
  require code, but few things really need that.
* &send_file went away and was replaced with: &wrap_file, &wrap_fd,
  &raw_file, &raw_fd.   &require is certainly the only stable
  interface at this point (though I don't see &raw_fd changing again).
  &wrap_* will probably have to change again to make file translations
  work "right".
* added support for hypertext'ed man pages from pre-formatted files.
  In this initial release they are specific to bsdi man pages
  but should be easy to configure for your local system (most of the
  config options are at the top of the bsdi-man.pl file).
* added some log file summerizing scripts

>System has 0,0 at the upper left.

Since, this issue doesn't want to die, I vote for staying with "0,0" at the
top,left. Except for PostScript, that is the common usage within character
based and bitmap based displays. Diverging from this practice now will
require extra transformations to the local text and graphics environments.
PostScript can be confusing sometimes because of the 0,0 at the bottom,
left. Think about large objects that span pages and arbitrary scaling of
objects where the "anchor" is typically at the top left of the object, not
at the bottom left. Even in the simplest cases, where there isn't a "page
boundary", drawing occurs from the top left, then down the virtual page,
with scrollbars added if needed. With Hebrew, Arabic, Kanji, etc. which
read right to left, you still start at the top of the page.

It would be possible to put "0,0" at some arbitrary location within an
image, like the center of the image so that you have the image overlayed on
a "normal" cartesian coordinate system. It requires a transformation as
simple as putting "0,0" at the bottom left, plus defining where you want
"0,0" and whether you want positive y to go up or down, prior to
referencing any images.

Folks:

Cello Beta version 0.5 is hereby shoved out the door.

Improvements:

Cello now supports the use of a mail relay host for the mailing
feature (thanks to several Alert Cellists).  Use Configure/Mail relay
to set this up.

Minor performance improvements have been made in the Telnet feature
(on the order of 20% in speed, depending on what you're doing).
(Thanks to Developer Guilt)

rlogin:// URLs are now supported by mapping them to telnet.
(Thanks to Alert Cellist Lou Montulli)

FTP directories now show a link which permits a move to the parent
directory.
(Thanks to an Alert Cellist whose mail message got trashed by me
before this got written up...you know who you are).

Along the way a few GPF problems and other assorted trash got fixed,
but in some cases I could not duplicate problems reported by Alert
Cellists.  While I appreciate receiving Doctor Watson logs and the
like when problems occur -- they really _are_ helpful -- it is also
very useful (and sometimes vital) for you to include a URL for the
resource you were trying to access when whatever problem occurred.  In
the case of GPF's which occur on exit, these can be fiendish to track
down, but some idea of what you were doing immediately prior to
exiting is useful.

Regards,
Tb.

Subject: Re: link areas within images

The notion that 0,0 at lower,left is "more traditional" is most valid for
paper pages, not for scrollable pages.  Computer displays are more often
oriented to top,left.  This may be due in part to the direction of raster
scanning, but I think that it has more to do with the notion of scrolling
where the bottom is in a sense undefined.  Let's keep 0,0 at top,left.

Hey, we could put 0,0 at the center and return polar coordinates. :-)
Or, we could map the image onto a 4D manifold...

Subject: direct WAIS in Lynx
To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Date: Thu, 24 Jun 93 17:26:37 CDT
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]

I've been porting Lynx to the 2.09 WWW library and adding the direct
WAIS modules.  My question is what is the best WAIS distribution to
use.  I downloaded wais-8-b5 and am having alot of compile troubles.
Is there another "free" WAIS that I should be using?  Is 8-b5 free
WAIS or is it the distribution that thinking machines distributes?

Another thing, is it a good idea to include the wais distribution
in the Lynx distribution for ease of installation?  Are there any
copywrite issues involved here?  

It looks like this isn't going to work on alot of machines anyways 
since WAIS requires an ANSI C compiler.

"free WAIS" == "freeWAIS 0.1" == CNIDR's packaging of "normal WAIS"
(from Thinking Machines) with lots of user-contributed fixes [boolean
searching, etc.] == the predecessor of freeWAIS 1.0, CNIDR's Mother of
all WAIS's and Z39.50-92 engine.  The FTP site is sunsite.unc.edu.

freeWAIS is good ('tho the X stuff still has bugs, damnit).  I would
*not* include the source in your distribution.  Include a message
saying the libraries you need, and where to find the source for them,
but don't include the code yourself -- many of us already have
freeWAIS and don't want to drag it over an expensive link again.

Subject: #WWW on IRC

What I thought would be really valuable is a WWW developers (possibly
and users) BBS, telnettable to.  That way the conversation could be
subdivided into topics (``boards'' for Clients, Mosaic, Servers, CERN
Code, WAIS, Getting Started, SGML-flamage, &c.).  The site to set this
up would need to be well connected, though (hint hint :-).

A problem I find with the mailing list is that *everything* is here,
which is not necessarily a good thing :).  I delete more than I read,
and it takes a while for the mail to get through.

As an interim idea, why not use IRC to communicate informally?  I'll
join #WWW on IRC whenever I'm on, and if there's sufficient interest,
I'll look into writing a 'bot to serve files, maybe even access the
web.  Someone with a less crappy connection to the backbone might be
able to run the 'bot if it gets going.

Feedback?  Abuse?  See you on IRC?

NO No No No NO!  Sub-division of the list maybe, but IRC NEVER!
Couldn't we come up with a Web based solution for this?  After all
we are writing Web clients!

It would require a PUT method, and possibly authorisation, both of
which are lacking at the moment :)

Not everyone needs to be on at the same time for informal discussions
-- for instance, your question about WAIS could have been answered by
me, likewise my query about the 2.06 distribution could have been
answered by saying ``fool, it was *fixed* in the 2.06 distribution''
:-).  Some things, net face-to-face would be nice for.

I think the problem with the current suggestions is that they rely on the
server suppling pathnames to commands. Firstly, the namespace on a machine is
particularly machine and configuration specifc; relying on a command to be in
particular directory is a bit tenuous. Secondly, we want the user and site
webmaster to be able to configure the way the commands are run.

A much better approach, IMHO, is to have a symbolic command
name which is mapped to a particular command by the browser (client, whatever
the correct terminology is). For example:

  exec:text-edit%/etc/passwd

The browser has some default mapping for text-edit, (eg: using the EDITOR 
environment variable in an xterm), however the user can override this if they
like (eg: if DISPLAY is set, and EDITOR is emacsclient, don't bother with
the xterm). If there is no mapping for the command name, some sort of requestor
thing is popped up. There is certainly scope to fetch the mapping information
from some remote server, but ultimately it's up to the browser to interpret
the command.

You should be able to pass arguments in some manner, eg: everything
after the percent or something similar It should be up to the
command to check for tainted/invalid arguments. I'd imagine most of the
commands would be shell scripts which assemble a command line and exec
it (Macs and PC's would have some sort of analouge).

Normally the browser should wait for the command to finish (report the exit
status if nonzero etc) however it would be cute to also have a mechanism
whereby the browser creates a pipe, and then runs the command with
stdin/stdout attached to the other end of the pipe. The browser then talks
http to the command across the pipe. The namespace of the command would
be something like:

  local:pid/

When the last page onto the command's namespace was closed, the command would
be killed (SIGHUP, or some additional http construct).

Now, why would we want to do this? Well, there are situations I see where it's
adventageous to keep state at the remote end of a http connection. For example,
you want to browse the contents of a compressed tar file, the command would
unpack it somewhere, when it started up and delete it when it exited. Keeping
state as the remote end is exactly the sort of thing you want to avoid across
network connections, but for local commands it's fine.

Appologies if I'm reiterating what has alreday been said ... Incidently, when
people have something new and interestign which is W3 related, please don't
just post the http address, some of us only have netfile ftp access to outside
world.

Actually, I kinda like that idea.  Particularly since there are now a
number of Muds that have pretty nicely integrated Web & Gopher
servers, and (at least) Gopher clients.  Hmmmmmm...

    Yeah . . . lets hold a revolution.  Death to the GUI Fascist
    Pig-Dogs?  Doesn't quite flow - oh well, will just have to wait
    for a better slogan.

    But on to the main point of the article.  Will browsers that run
    on dumb tty's be featured?  Lots of people that would benefit from
    the web (and contribute to it eventually) aren't fortunate enough
    to have X terminals or SparcStations sitting on their desks (lets
    not forget how spoiled we are), and some even have to deal with
    macs.  (And lets not forget those poor unfortunates without net
    connections (linuxers in particular)).

Whilst I'm not innately opposed the idea of a bulletin board (server,
archive, whatever), please do spare a thought for us plebs without internet
connections (mind you; I am working on it!). Anyway, the mailing list format
is a Good Thing for developers conferences; there's typically a much lower
noise level than newsgroups/bulletin boards/IRC (mailing lists are typically
much more intimidating to new users :-)

There is probably scope for creating channels on this mailing list, but I 
don't think it's too bad at the moment.

I think Terry's solution of requiring a <CODE> to get a fixed-width
font within a PRE is simpler and more general. Right now, I come across
things such as addresses, e.g.

National Center for Supercomputing Applications
405 E. Springfield Avenue
Champaign, Illinois 61820

that there really isn't any way to code in HTML sensibly. It certainly
isn't a poem, either.

A line-break primitive would solve that and keep <pre> pure (the whole
point behind <pre> is that it's preformatted in ASCII and browsers
shouldn't screw around with that formatting; it shouldn't simply mean
"newlines significant").

No. It should mean "newlines and spaces significant."

Since one can already imbed codes in PRE sections, the
browsers are already screwing around with the formatting. A line
break primitive makes for messy coding (I sure wouldn't want to
format Shakespeare with it). 

I need one of two things:

a) PRE defaults to the proportional spaced font.

or

b) A primitive (<R> for Roman?) that forces the viewer to use the
proportional spaced font.

OK how about this:

A new tag FIGT which allows you to position arbitrary text at a given
point in the image. The optional "BOX" attribute requests the browser to draw
a background box (obscuring the image). You can choose to make the whole of
the box into a hypertext link, or to use the A tag for designated parts of
the text. The optional "WIDTH" attribute allows you to limit the width of
the box. By default, the browser will make the width equal the lesser of the
length of the text string or the right most extent of the image.

I have also switched back to having the upper left as (0,0). Furthermore,
to provide backwards compatibility with servers supporting X Mosaic's ISMAP
feature, I have added the "PIX" attribute to FIG. This switches the coordinate
scheme to pixels for the scope of the figure, i.e. for FIGA, FIGT and sending
mouse clicks to the server.

This will make it practical to automatically convert HTML documents into
the HTML+ format, so that we can painlessly switch to the new DTD.

Cheers,

Dave Raggett

n.b. I have ditched "ISMAP" in favour of "MAP" to ensure people realise
that the mechanism is not the same (i.e. it defaults to scaled coords).

----------- DTD snippet for figures ---------------------------------------

<!-- Figures

    Figures can be fixed to the point in the text flow where
    they should appear or may float relative to the text.

    The image/drawing is specified by a URL or as embedded
    data for simple drawings. The elements text serves
    as the caption. Use the CREDIT emphasis to record
    photo credits etc.

    Mouse clicks can be handled by server (MAP) or browser (FIGA)
    The coordinate scheme is (0,0) for upper left and (1,1)
    for the lower right of the figure with X to the right
    and Y up the "page". When sending clicks to the server
    append to URL as in:   URL?X,Y

    The PIX attribute switches the coordinate scheme to
    pixel values with (0,0) as the top left. This is intended
    to provide backwards compatibility with servers that
    support X Mosaic's ISMAP feature.

    For backwards compatibility with servers which support
    X Mosaic's ISMAP feature

    Clicks on areas designated with FIGA should take
    preference over handling by the server.

    FIGT allows you to position text over the figure.

Ken,

Following Marc Andreessen's lead, I have added some rendering hints
to the P tag, along with two new tags: BR (line break) and SP (unbreakable
space). These will give you the control you need, e.g.

<P INDENT>
National Center for Supercomputing Applications<BR>
405 E. Springfield Avenue<BR>
Champaign, Illinois 61820<BR>

gives:
        National Center for Supercomputing Applications
        405 E. Springfield Avenue
        Champaign, Illinois 61820

The EMPH tag has been likewise extended to include rendering hints:

<!ELEMENT EMPH - - (%text;)*>
<!ATTLIST EMPH
    type    CDATA   #IMPLIED    -- logical category e.g. CITE --
    b       (b)     #IMPLIED    -- render in bold font --
    i       (i)     #IMPLIED    -- render in italic font --
    u       (u)     #IMPLIED    -- underline text --
    tt      (tt)    #IMPLIED    -- render in typewriter font --
    vp      (vp)    #IMPLIED    -- render in variable pitch font --
    sup     (sup)   #IMPLIED    -- superscript --
    sub     (sub)   #IMPLIED    -- subscript --
    index   CDATA   #IMPLIED    -- entries for index compilation -->

This allows you to switch fonts by <EMPH VP>variable pitch</EMPH>, even
within PRE elements.

My real concern now is the bias to West European languages. Latin-1 is
inadequate for other areas of the world. Unicode (16 bit fonts) helps
but doesn't address non-extant languages such as old english.

Cheers, 

Dave Raggett

I would like to propose the following extension (not too difficult, but
I couldn't find all the places to modify):

Allow Xmosaic to read symbolic links as URL's

That is, allow files like the following:

mosaic-docs -> http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/mosaic-docs
cave.html -> http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/evl/cave/cave.html

This would simplify the storage of bookmarks and allow a user to
organize their local hierarchy appropriate to the information resources
that they had identified, e.g. collecting URL's about a specific subject
or concept area.

I did an initial hack to the code to allow the interpretation of
symbolic links, but would like to see this extension permeated
throughout the code (i.e. saving, etc..)

No.  There is no organizational structure to the subject.html file or
you must have some methodology for the creation, editting and
organization of such HTML documents.  The file system paradigm, with
directories and a hierarchy, is a more prevalent and more open design
with many options for creative interfaces (e.g. utilizing the
OpenWindows file manager to access HTML links via launching Xmosaic or
using ToolTalk between the file manager and Xmosaic).

Let me suggest that you visit JaysHouse, "a MOO for friends to talk,
experiment with networking, hypertext, collaboration, etc." at
    telnet://jhm.moo.mud.org:1709/

MOO stands for "MUD, Object-Oriented"; it's a text-based simulated world with
an object-oriented programming language used to create the components of that
world.  Among those components are, of course, people and rooms; also a
full-fledged mail/newsgroup system, which could be used as you indicated for
splitting discussion into topics (while still keeping them all closely
related.)

We at JH have been using MOO to explore some of the same issues that show up
in WWW.  For example, we developed a Gopher client in MOO that allows for
collaborative browsing of Gopher, and embedding of Gopher data in `physical'
objects--for example, a `weather map' in the living room that gets its data
from the Gopher weather server.  More recently we've been working on our own
internal hypertext system, used to add a richer dimension to the MOO's help
system, as well as notes and other assorted objects.  There's a gateway to
jtext--said hypertext system--at
    http://jhm.moo.mud.org:7043/
I think this has been announced in www-land before, but I'm not sure.

I see JH as a technology demonstration---I'm not proposing that all
the WWW people move in there.  If people feel that this is a
communication medium worth exploring, we can find a site and set up a
WWW-specific server.

Oh--I'm usually logged on as "Jay".  Other good people to talk to
about hypertext stuff are Joe (or Joe Feedback) and Ron, and other
people can be helpful as well.  We'd like to talk to WWW people about
this as a possible communication system, and hear what you think.

Hope to see you soon.

Subject: Encapsulating HTTP in MIME

Message-Id: <7883.741040647@moose.cs.indiana.edu>

HTTP, particularly HTTP/1.0, is a transaction oriented protocol.  I
believe there are advantages to generating a mechanism whereby the
individual portions of the transactions (the REQUEST and the RESPONSE)
can be treated as MIME content-types, allowing separation,
encapsulation, forwarding, and the usual MIME stuff.

I (tentatively and roughly) suggest the creation of two additional
MIME types:

  message/http-request

and

  message/http-response

with their contents being identical to the request and response
messages of an HTTP transsaction, respectively.  Since the machine and
port of an HTTP transaction aren't represented within the request or
response explicitly, the request will need this as a parameter called
"host" or some such when it can't be assumed to be the machine reading
the request.

WHY DO THIS?

One advantage to this kind of method is that it should make it easier
for non-interactive users to utilize the full power of HTTP/1.0 via
mail messages sent to a mailbot that can take the http-request, send
it over the network as appropriate, and send back the result
encapsulated as an http-response.  This allows for precise tagging and
should help make a more automated environment for WWW users stuck on
UUCP or other dialup networks sending HTTP transactions via email (or
other means.)  The current mailbot, while servicable, is hardly
elegant; this could, in principle, let UUCP people (or people with
paranoid firewalls, or whatever) use XMosaic, just a bit slower.

The ability to encapsulate requests and responses inside other MIME
objects will also allow for Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) security
services, notably authentication, to be applied to HTTP transactions.
The problem of authorization to data may be handled by simply taking
the entire REQUEST segment, tagging it as an http-request, and signing
it with standard PEM techniques.  MIME-PEM interoperation is still an
internet draft, but the big issues are pretty much taken care of; only
minor syntactic matters remain.

The only real area of uncertainty I have is what HTTP request method
is appropriate for sending an encapsulated request to a server
directly.  It could use the PUT or POST methods, or a new method.
I'll use PUT for the moment.  Thus, a simple request to a mailbot
might look kind of like this:

  From: jrandom@nowhere.org
  To: mailbot@www.some.place.edu
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: message/http-request; host="info.cern.ch:80"

  GET /hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html HTRQ/1.0
  From: jrandom@nowhere.org
  Accept: text/plain; text/html; image/gif; ...
  User-Agent: ...
  [ ... ]

and the mailbot would send back a message something like this:

  From: mailbot@www.some.place.edu
  To: jrandom@nowhere.org
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: message/http-response

  103 200 OK
  Last-Modified: <date>
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: text/html

  [the HTML document]

An authenticated transaction searching for information in an online
multimedia encyclopedia might look vaguely like this:

  PUT request HTRQ/1.0
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: multipart/pem; boundary="boundary"; privacy=mic-only

Thus, the *entire* HTTP request is encapsulated inside the
authenticated (and, if desired, encrypted) portion of the message;
this is important, since the whole request should be authenticated
(the first line is probably the most important thing to verify) and
protected by the PEM structure.

The preceeding example is based on the current internet draft
draft-ietf-pem-mime-02.txt; if you aren't familiar with it, the above
may look a little odd.  Naturally, "ordinary" requests and replies
would normally be used in situations not requiring services of PEM.

I believe this kind of content tagging has some general advantages for
increasing the ability to do HTTP transactions indirectly, and has the
distinct advantage of continuing HTTP's relationship with MIME and
closeness with "normal" mail.  Trying to force a PEM signature into an
HTTP Authorization: header or some such might be possible, but seems
like a bad idea to me.

I also believe that using PEM as a model for security services
continues the close relationship between HTTP and mail and is strongly
preferable to using Kerberos; I won't rant about this one right now
though.

Obviously, details and syntax and stuff would need to be fleshed out;
for example, it might be desirable to use unique identifiers
(Message-ID?) to allow clients receiving responses in batch mode by
UUCP to sort out which responses go with with requests.  In general, I
think this kind of development would be of use.

Don't laugh -- MUDs are just a first cut at a simulated world (VR is
such an over-used term), and they don't necessarily have to be filled
with hacking and slashing.  Indeed, I think you're about to find out
how good they can be for:
 -- multiway chat,
 -- simple user-interfaces,
and

I agree.  I've even been thinking about using one for doing customer
support at BSDI.  Customers could log into the MUD and get patches,
info, open bugs, check out reported bugs, open problem reports (for
those with support), maybe even chat with developers on occasion.

I think MUDs are great.  A WWW<->MUD gateway would be even better.
Someone needs to write WWWmud that uses HTML to build the interface
(problem is MUD's are interactive, when are we going to have iHTML? :-)
Still it could be done with some compromises.

Anyone want to hack "ihttp://..." into their browser? :-)

WWW Usage Tracking
------------------
  Is anyone interested in tracking WWW usage?

  I propose someone setup a mail gateway for usage reports that get dumped
  into the Web.  I would be willing to do this if no one else is interested.
  I could at least archive the raw data onto the Web if not summerize it and
  graph it.

  Maybe a weekly report that says something like:

    Date: Sat Jun 26 03:01:56 GMT 1993
    Server: http://www.bsdi.com/
    Requests last 7 days: 3589
    Unique hosts last 7 days: 69
    Total unique hosts: 847
    Total requests: 18358
    Total days of service: 52

  Whatdaya think?

  At some point it would be neat if someone could take all the IP addresses
  from all the servers and ``uniq'' them to get an idea of how many users
  we have (My server has 847 unique ip addresses in the log).  Does anyone
  care about having their IP address uniqued?  Does anyone care about having
  their IP address made public (I'm not suggesting this, just curious).

  Once HTTP/1.0 gets more widespread we will be able to track client usage.

  In case anyone else is interested: my 7 day summaries for the past
  52 days (minus this week).  Each * is 100 requests.

    05/03 ********************
    05/10 ********************
    05/17 ******************
    05/24 ***************
    05/31 ***********************
    06/07 *****************************
    06/14 *******************************

  Anyone else have this data they can post?

A Related Issue
---------------

  Is anyone having any performance problems with their HTTP servers?  I did
  some tests on my 486DX2/66 (call it 31MIPS) and found that Plexus runs
  about 5 tps, and I timed the NCSA server that runs from inetd but it's
  not a fair comparison (1 tps) because you could run it native and save
  the exec cost.  What are you busy server people running at peak (in tps)?
  I would **really** like to hear what tps other people are getting and on
  what hardware (~ MIPS anyway) and if you can do some peak performance
  tests that would help.  I expect it'll be about the same (5 tps peak) on
  most hardware available today as I think most of the overhead is beyond
  the control of the server (i.e., in TCP/IP and exec).

I'd like to suggest the following form for a new type of URL.  This would
answer the need of a 'finger' URL type, as well as others, in a simple,
generic interface.

	A Generic TCP URL Type - 

		ex. tcp://host.domain:port/data_for_tcp_port

	where:
		-	port would be numeric as well as symbolic,
				79 or finger
		-	data_for_tcp_port would allow escaped chars,
				line#1\nline#2\nline#3

	Possible uses:

	Finger 		- 	"tcp://ruby.ora.com:79" or
				"tcp://ruby.ora.com:finger/username"

	Webster 	-	"tcp://ora.com:webster/DEFINE server\nQUIT"

	Whois		-	"tcp://rs.internic.net:43/ORA.COM"

	Time		-	"tcp://localhost:daytime"

	NNTP		-	"tcp://ruby.ora.com:nntp/LIST"

Any comments?

   What about security?  What if some bozo decided to put a url like:

tcp://some.generic.news.server:nntp/line#1\nCODE TO FORGE NEWSGROUP\n...

or

tcp://some.generic.news.server:25/HELO some.host\nRCPT TO: root\nMAIL
FROM: stupid.user\nDATA\n Hey bozo - <Very derogative statements> Love
- stupid.user\n.\nQUIT\n

And called it something like "Man Pages For Ultrix"?

Could lead to some interesting discussions with your local sysadmin if
you clicked on that second one. :)

I talked with Marc Vanheyningen about this a few months ago, and he
convinced me that it would be a _BAD THING_ to do something like this.
Not that there are many bozos out there that would do one of the
above, but it would only take one or two to cause some real trouble.

Eric,
  The justification for using xv to display inlined images is listed right
in your reply: xv displays *many* different image types.  We are using
mosaic to display a database of medical journals we have; however, since
the page images are in TIFF format, I have to convert to GIF them all to
GIF.  
  One of the things we're interested in is services which dynamically
generate an HTML representation of the results of some search or filtering
process.  There is no way of knowing, apriori, what document formats we
might encounter and we would like a client with general image display
capabilities.  Xv fills this role nicely.
  Further, we envision offloading as much of the processing from the client
as possible.  Rather than including local format conversion capability within
the client, we expect to provide a "community of servers" with which the
client can contract to obtain the information it wants, and in a form which
it can use.  By providing a particular server (such as xv) with a window id,
the client retains control of the presentation of the information while
avoiding having to know anything about the format of the data being displayed.
  
Marc,
  Suppose someone (such as ourselves) were able to integrate tooltalk
functionality into mosaic, *and* could provide an HDF- and tooltalk-capable
version of xv (or some such image manipulation package).  Would the technology
fit into your development strategy for mosaic?

I strongly disagree.  The security issue is inherent in the network, not
in URLs. We should not attempt to scale some moral high ground simply to
stop up some possible security holes, which are not ours to stop up in the
first place. 

The answer to insecure network services is to make them more secure, not
to limit the deployment and usefulness of URLs. 

If a dedicated cracker wishes to break the system, I would suggest that
writing an HTML document, and using that as a lock pick on doors which
have no locks to begin with, would be a marvelous exercise in stupidity.

I believe we should have an attitude similar to that of MIME regarding
security:

- Security is more important than interoperability
- No additions should be made without a careful review of possible
  security issues
- User agents should present the user with sufficient information for
  the user to avoid possible traps, and should do so in a way that
  even a relatively inexperienced user can understand

Allowing an attacker to cause a victim to telnet to an arbitrary port
on an arbitrary machine and send arbitrary data certainly has some
potential risks.

Scenario:  Someone installs a document with a hyperlink that, when
activated, causes bad mail (say, a death threat) to be mailed to the
President of your organization/university/whatever.  You click on it.
Depending on the implementation of the client, you may or may not see
anything out of the ordinary, and you may or may not understand what
it means.  If the attacker is clever, it's labeled something like
"Click here to see some sample SMTP output."

Three days later, you are brought up on charges of mailing a death
threat.  An investigation of transfer logs, RFC 931 authentication
protocols, or whatever reveal that the message did come from your
account/machine (which is correct; it *did*.)  You have no idea what
happened.  Even if you did suspect a bad hyperlink, the offending HTML
document has been changed (and may have even been rigged by the server
to only look that way for you, and only once.)

That's just an offhand scenario.  It might also be possible to forge
postings (including control postings that do damage, like sendsys or
rmgroup or cancel) or muck with other widely used protocols.

Being able to do that kind of arbitrary URL referencing would have
some advantages, and would lessen the need for gateways; this is good.
My own inclination is that a client would have to take significant
steps to reduce the risk of problems, and that the advantage of this
kind of URL would be outweighed by the added inconvenience of users
being warned of arbitrary transactions for approval (not to mention
the trouble for client writers.)  That's just an inclination, though.
I'd be interested in the results of a security review; maybe it's not
as much a problem as I'm guessing.

This is true in and of itself.  However, the true danger is that this
is would be a remarkably efficient way to trick other people into
doing things not in their best interest (as Marc VH points out) and
therefore I think this is a bad road to travel down.  Let's keep such
functionality on the server/gateway side; it is easy enough to write
gateways as it is (and in fact it would be trivial to write a gateway
to accomplish exactly the functionality Rob describes).

tkWWW uses xloadimage to display images inside the tkWWW executable.
It's actually quite simple to set up.  All you have to do is to pass
the window argument to xloadimage.  The only tricky part is that when
you you are finished displaying the image, you need to display a white
field to free the colormap cells.

tkWWW doesn't support the image tag (yet).  This is because the
current version of tk doesn't support window children of the text
widget.  As soon as the tk gurus have that working........

Subject: SGML baggage (was HTML spec)

Regarding Marc and Dave's exchange a week ago:

It may be that eyes glaze over when the letters SGML are uttered,
but we need it as a way of making rules and drawing limits.  With
SGML I can parse my HTML docs and be confident that any browser
using the HTML DTD (and, let us hope, soon the HTML+ DTD) will
be able to handle my docs and not choke.  They may even
be presented in a way that makes their structure clear by 
typographic means.

All DTDs compromise between semantic and visual markup.  The 
exchange about white space touched on this point.  

So the thing to do is enrich the DTD so that reasonable presentation
demands can be met, relying on semantic tagging rather than visual
tagging as much as feasible, then hide the whole SGML layer from writers
who don't want to hear about SGML.  To the extent the markup of our docs
is semantic rather than visual, we're ahead.  

After all, the non-Postscript alternative is RTF  (snore) . . .

Subject: One PRE, and entities

Dear Dave:
Sorry not to respond sooner to your post of Monday last, pointing
out HTML+'s style attribute for PRE.  This is okay, but maybe
not the most economical approach. 

I think there are two issues:  1) the spec's definition of 
leading white space and line breaks as significant within PRE, 
and 2) font changes within PRE.  Presently, 1 seems to work just 
fine (at least in xmosaic and lynx, the two browsers I'm using 
for trials), so it should not be necessary to institute a <BR> 
tag to get line breaks within PRE.  Outside PRE one shouldn't 
need them (counterexamples welcome).

Presently, however, PRE is defined as having typewriter type
as its default font, and I think that's wrong.   I'd rather have
to invoke that font (by <CODE>) explicitly, the default font
remaining the same as the main text.  That way I don't need
an <R> tag, which has also been suggested, and when I
have an address to display, I can type:
<PRE>
       Name
       Address
       Telephone.  
</PRE>
and get three indented lines in the main text font.
I think that if the definition of PRE is changed in this way
the style attribute might not be needed.

On another topic you mentioned, charsets, wide fonts, and
outline fonts, what I gleaned from the recent discussion of
Unicode on comp.text.sgml is that it shouldn't wreck the 
SGML mechanism.  For what is not supported by Unicode, should
we choose to go that rather quirky route, the SGML external
entity mechanism is the obvious method, as you point out.  
We already have character entities in the HTML DTD; all that's 
needed is to establish how to reference external entity sets not 
actually included in the HTML+ DTD.  SGML rather envisions that
the entity files are available locally at run time; for WWW it
might be better to be able to indicate the entity files are on
the same machine the document is being fetched from.

And if we can reference external entities, we can do something
requested this week in my office:  use entities to represent
URLs.  Than means 1) URLs themselves may be extracted from the 
main document and collated in a referenced navigational document,
and 2) common link types may be generated automatically:  for
any "Next" link, my &next; entity can refer to a script that 
looks through a list of filenames, chooses the one after the 
current file, and returns that as the URL for the target of 
the link.  

I'l like to suggest that references to external entities go
in the HEAD of the document.

Regards,
.

Subject: browser execution

I've thought about this business of getting a WWW browser to execute
a program and I've convinced that a new URL scheme is necessary
for some uses.  In particular, you need it if you want to repeatedly
run a program which outputs HTML (or MIME) and generally acts like
a server.

An executable MIME content type is good for "one-shot" executions
(like a "mail developers" link which runs a mailer), but it can't
cover the more dynamic semi-server case.  Why?  Because you need
a MIME document to back up each URL your server outputs that
refers back to the server.  This is fine with an HTTP server, but
for a browser-executed server it means having a file for every
link which defeats the purpose.

A hack to the file: scheme is mostly OK except that it limits executable
things to file: (no big deal with the MIME executable content type),
is not particularly abstract (it points to a specific file) and leaves
the relative URL semantics hanging.  Look at the HTML output of
file:/bin/rn.html%/comp/sources/misc.  If it outputs the anchor
<A HREF=/comp/binaries/mac>mac</A>, does that mean
file:/comp/binaries/mac or file:/bin/rn.html%/comp/sources/mac?
The writer of "rn.html" would certainly prefer the latter over
having to constantly spit out full references, but the former is
what should really happen.  Sure, we could pass in the full URL
to rn.html so it knows the path, but that seems pretty messy.

So how about this:  an "exec:" scheme that looks like:

	exec://encoded-URL/opaque/stuff/like/other/URLs

Semantics: decode the "encoded-URL", grab it and execute it
with the rest of the URL.  I used the  "//" notation so
that executables can ouput "/" rooted URLs without having
to know who they are, that is, rn.html can say "<A HREF=/comp/risks>".
We can do the "encoded-URL" any way we like, but suppose that
: -> ; and / -> \.  A full exec: URL might look like:

	exec://file;\bin\rn.html/comp/sources/misc

However, with the MIME executable content type, I'd expect that
most exec: URLs would point to files, so file: would be the default.
Additionally, the browser might have some notion of a PATH for
exec: files (possibly as a first-level security mechanism), so the
whole thing could be shortened to:

	exec://rn.html/comp/sources/misc

I fully realize that these URLs probably won't work between different
sites.  I don't expect WWW servers to be sending you these any time
soon (unless they're trying to delete all your files :-), but
it's possible if some general agreement on the symbolic names
happens.  For instance, it may become agreed that
<A HREF=exec://mailer/mosaic-guys@ncsa>bug report</A> will
fire up some kind of mail program.

While the file: with %/ hack is workable, I think this is better.
What do you think?

SAS strikes again (server aversion syndrome :-)

FYI: Here is how using content-type might work for your example of a
pseudo-newsreader (using a server of course).

    <A HREF="http://server/rn.html">drink me</A>

on selection returns the document:

    content-type: application/x-csh
    ... whatever you wanted rn.html to do
    ... links can look like <A HREF="http://server/article/####">read me</A>

http://server/article/#### returns:

    content-type: application/x-csh
    ... whatever you wanted rn.html to do with the #### argument

So I argue we should figure out to have the browser talk to a local server
rather than figure out how to encode arbitary commands in the URL.

My reasoning:
  o Browsers cannot change on a whim, because for the Web to be truly
    useful to the user community at large all browsers must support the
    **same** set of features (to a large extent anyway).
  o Therefore we **must** have a definition for the browser that is simple
    and complete such that any features you might ever want can be done
    in a server.

    So why the SAS that seems to be so prevalent?  Instead of hacking
    things into the browser we should be looking for ways to extend the
    browser such that servers can do those tasks, but everyone seems to
    be heading the opposite direction.  Maybe this is something we
    can take up at the workshop (what should go in the server and what
    should we build-in to the browser).

I'm not a purist or anything, I think it's fine if we want the browser to
support things like gopher and ftp directly but at some point we are going
to have to draw the line if we want most browsers to support a common
set of features (even <IMG> is a good example of this problem).

Besides making the problem harder and adding a level of indirection,
I don't see how talking to a local server is any different.  Instead
of figuring out how to encode a command into the URL, you have to figure
out how to encode a command into an application/x-csh content type.
The content type isn't going to be any more portable than the URL
encoding and it may even be harder to do security checks on it.

I'd hardly call executable content types any more supportable by all
browsers than exec: URLs.  They're both inherently local things if
you want side effects and that has no effect to the community at
large since they won't see them.  Not all the browsers are equal
right now, which is healthy progress in action -- you can't raise the
bar all at once.  For that matter, exec: URLs would be more uniform
since they operate at a lower level.

Servers are not _that_ easy to write.  They are if you're running UNIX
and you have either inetd.conf privileges or know how to do sockets.
Who knows what you'd have to do under VMS or MVS and you just can't
do them under MS-DOS.  On the other hand, writing a program which
dumps some HTML to a file is easy and possible under all systems.
It's very similar to adding to a server, but anybody, not just the
server administrator can do it and they can share with other non-privileged
users.

Even if you can easily run a server, you've got some security problems
to deal with.  Having a browser that will execute code (or URLs, whatever)
from documents is a little scary; having a server that anyone can
connect to execute code is really scary.  With the browser executing
code you leverage off the normal system authentication.  With a server,
you have to re-invent that.  Sure, these features are coming and
that's good; but you're building up an awful lot of stuff to solve
a simple problem.

Well, if you want to add features you have a choice.  Either make it
harder for the browser writers or make it harder for the server writers.
I maintain that the exec: URL scheme makes it a little harder for
the browser writers but is a boon for server writers since it truly
makes it easy to write a server (just like the simple inetd scripts,
but you don't need privilege).

I'd be more inclined to encode the URL with the general percent escape
notation, but that's just me.

(Unrelated question:  Consider the URL http://foo/search?bar%2Bbaz --
how many search keywords does it have, and what are they?  My
inclination is to interpret it as one keyword "bar+baz", though that's
inconvenient for the server since it can't just do all the percent
substitution immediately upon receiving the object.)

This sounds a bit more portable and a bit less anxiety-inducing as far
as security is concerned.  A special directory (or set of aliases, or
something) of safe commands described with somewhat abstract names
could work out OK.  The result is that your local commands end up of
the form:

	exec://mail-rfc822/x-mosaic@ncsa.uiuc.edu

or something like that.  Whether this is better than the form:

	mail-rfc822://x-mosaic@ncsa.uiuc.edu

(or something like that) is debatable either way; I think either is
probably workable as long as the number of different things you can do
that way is rather small, considered carefully, and centrally
registered in some fashion.

I agree here, which is why I'm hesitant to extend things to a general
execution type since programs (particularly, say, cshell programs) are
inherintly non-portable.  I suppose we could try to agree on a
language to specify programs to be executed in.  Such a language would
need a number of attributes:

- Highly portable, will run on UNIX boxes, DOS boxes, Macs, whatever
- Freely available
- Can work in a "paranoid" fashion whereby it is reasonably safe to
  execute untrusted code with it

I'm not sure such a language can even exist.  (Perl meets the first
two criteria, at least.)  I'm pretty sure that inventing it is more
than we can or should try to do.

I concur; one problem is that most people will generally use just one
browser and thus they'll write documents assuming that everyone else
uses it too.  I've seen documents that rely on IMG too much, given the
number of browsers that don't support it.

Servers _can be_ easy to write.  A base server could allow you to
easily add new functionality of the variety you discuss without
needing to understand the details of UNIX sockets (not that they're
really that complicated anyway.)  Plexus, for example, allows this.
Don't confuse limitations of particular implementations with
limitations of HTTP servers in general.

Servers can run without privilige; ours runs as id "daemon" and
doesn't have the priv to do much other than dequeue other people's
print jobs.  Surely webmasters don't run their HTTP server as root?

Browsers, on the other hand, have to run as users and are thus capable
of harming their users; I find using "normal system authentication"
(as it exists on most machines) to run code in this kind of situation
highly undesirable.

Except that what has been written isn't a server at all, it's just a
program.  It doens't provide a service to anyone except the person (or
small group of people) who have examined it, decided it safe, and
placed it on their list of commands for which exec:ing is permissible.
(unless this procedure is not used, in which case it's a security hole
you could drive an aircraft carrier through.)

Subject: Encapsulating HTTP parts in MIME
Date: Mon, 28 Jun 1993 09:26:12 -0500
Message-Id: <29789.741277572@moose.cs.indiana.edu>
Sender: mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu

Following is an updated and (I think) better version of my earlier
suggestion.  I have also posted it to the newsgroup; I'd prefer if
people who can access it discuss it there rather than in this mailing
list since it's crossposted so the MIME community can also contribute
suggestions (and since it's not really possible to cross-post on
mailing lists.)

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a transaction oriented protocol
based on request-response.  I believe there are some advantages to
being able to consider these components (the request and the response)
as MIME content-types, so they may be forwarded, gatewayed,
encapsulated, authenticated, encrypted, and the like via standard MIME
techniques.  Since both the request and the response in HTTP/1.0 are
already very close to MIME messages, I believe that "message" is the
appropriate primary content-type.

There are two applications which most readily come to mind for this
kind of definition:

- Allowing the full power of HTTP/1.0 to be utilized via a mailbot,
  for users who cannot use HTTP directly due to limitations of dialup
  links like UUCP, firewalls, etc.
- Allow an HTTP request or response to have some or all of the
  security services made possible for MIME objects by the PEM-MIME
  inter-operation standard (still in draft right now.)

Significant concerns I have in mind:

- As much as possible, the new system should work smoothly with both
  HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/0.9.
- MIME gateways should be able to handle these messages (e.g. change
  the Content-Transfer-Encoding as necessary for various transports)
  smoothly.

A tentative method:

Define a request as content-type "message/http-request".

Required parameters:
  method:	the method of the request (e.g. "GET")
  object:	the object of the request (e.g. "/foo/bar/baz.html")
  version:	which version of HTTP (e.g. "HTTP/1.0", or is it "HTRQ/1.0" ?)

Optional parameters:
  address(?):	the address of the HTTP server (e.g. "info.cern.ch:80")
  id:		a unique identifier to be returned with the response
		(e.g. "12345@foo.bar")

The request itself (minus the first line, which is given in the
required parameters) follows.  Obviously, in HTTP/0.9, these
parameters contain the whole request and thus the content will always
be empty, while in HTTP/1.0 these parameters contain a MIME message
(possibly with some additional RFC822-style headers.)
 
Define as another content type "message/http-response".

Required parameters:
  version:	the version of the response (e.g. "HTTP/1.0")

Optional parameters:
  status:	the numeric result (mandatory in HTTP/1.0 only, e.g. "200")
  reason:	the textual result (also HTTP/1.0 only, e.g. "OK")
  in-reply-to:	the unique identifier from the "id" parameter of the
		http-request for which this is the response

The body contains the remainder of the response; in HTTP/1.0, it will
consist of an MIME message (possibly with some additional
822-compliant headers.)  In HTTP/0.9 it will not consist of any
headers; therefore, a blank line will precede the text (the blank line
is the boundary between the lines of headers [of which there are none]
and the body of the encapsulated message.)

WHY TO DO IT THIS WAY
---------------------

Since message/rfc822 is the primary subtype of message, it seems
reasonable that user agents and (more importantly) gateways should
generally treat unknown subtypes of messages as such.

Hence, the first line of information from both the request and the
response has been removed from the body and placed in the parameters;
the first line is not syntactically a legal 822 header, and thus would
likely confuse gateways.  Gateways need to be able to understand this
subtype properly, so that they can do things like change the encoding
as necessary.  (HTTP goes over direct sockets, and thus normally
"binary" is always available as an encoding, but this will not be the
case when using a mailbot.)  Am I correct in supposing that this
method will make gateway handling relatively painless?

Putting these things into parameters doesn't feel very philosophically
clean, though.  I suppose I could instead make a part like
"multipart/http-request" with two parts, one the "header" (the leading
line containing method, object and version) and the second being the
822 compliant message.  I think the parameter method seems simpler to
understand, implement, and use (though I don't know which is
philosophically cleaner.)

I'm not really sure how to deal with the case of HTTP/0.9 vs. HTTP/1.0
responses, since the latter is a MIME message while the former is not.
Putting the blank line as "end of headers" in 0.9 is the best I can
think of to still allow some generality and give gateways a chance to
do the right thing regarding encoding; I'd love to hear better
suggestions.

Arguably, putting an id and in-reply-to parameter is redundant with
their similar headers in the message itself.  However, normally an MUA
does not make these headers available to the originating and receiving
programs, while parameters normally are.

Obviously, it is best to respond with the same version as the request,
it is acceptable to respond with an earlier version than the request,
and it is forbidden to respond with a later version than the request.

SOME EXAMPLES
-------------

A simple dialogue with a mailbot to do an HTTP/1.0 poll:

  To: mailbot
  From: joe_user@somewhere.com
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: message/http-request; address="info.cern.ch:80"; 
		method="GET"; object="/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html";
		version="HTTP/1.0"; id="1234@somewhere.com"

  From: joe_user@somewhere.com
  Accept: text/plain; text/html; application/postscript; image/gif
  User-Agent: 
  [ this is a blank line, and it is significant ]

and the mailbot would respond with something like this:

  From: mailbot
  To: joe_user@somewhere.com
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: message/http-response; version="HTTP/1.0";
		in-reply-to="1234@somewhere.com"; status=200;
		reason="Document follows"

  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: text/html
		
  <HEADER>
  <TITLE>The World Wide Web project</TITLE>
  <NEXTID N="59">
  </HEADER>
  <BODY>
  <H1>World Wide Web</H1>The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area<A
  [ ... ]

Naturally, these objects could be encapsulated inside other objects,
though the only use for that which I can think of would be making the
request or response the secured object of a multipart/pem message.

Any comments, reactions, flames, or other thoughts?

Hi all,

Just a quick note to say that Warchie, the full-hypertext Archie gateway,
is moving. I rewrote Warchie in Perl, called it ArchiePlex (becuase it
fits into Plexus so nicely, and because nobody knew how to pronounce
Warchie), and installed it under http://web.nexor.co.uk/archieplex.

The "List of Hypertext Archie Servers" can now be reached from
http://web.nexor.co.uk/archie.html. This document is probably the 
best one to link to.

The Warchie service on web.nexor.co.uk:1993 will be turned off shortly,
and the Warchie documentation will probably be moved off-line.

To implement this, check out the ServiceMail Toolkit, a package that
helps in constructing mailbots that speak MIME.  You'll find it in
the metamail contrib distribution (try to get a recent version with
ServiceMail 2.0).  I'm the primary author, I'd be glad to help someone
figure out how to use it for this application.  (I'd been planning to
do it myself.)

ServiceMail installations usually use the Subject: field to contain
the "method" and its parameters.  Especially if you put it in the
embedded message/http-request, this fits well.

We're in the middle of adding PEM-MIME support to ServiceMail; we're
directly supporting symmetric-key, in the PEM-MIME style.  Public-key
is still too hazy with respect to licensing.

Hey, I remember a while back someone suggested having certain standard
links in the document (forw back up top).  Instead of hardcoding these
how about just having a control panel element that might work like this:

<CONTROL>
    <UL>
	<LI> <A ...>Click here</A>
	<LI> <A ...>Drink me</A>
	<LI> <A ...>Go away</A>
    </UL>
</CONTROL>

Then a clever browser can do whatever it wants to render that section of
code (the idea being that it could stick it in a window so it's always
available for navigation).  By default it can just render in place.

This has the advantage of allowing us to experiment with different control
structures.  FBUT is ok for some documents but I can see applications where
other navigation schemes would be useful (e.g., NSEW in maps).

Any comments?  Sorry if someone already "invented" this, I didn't see anything
in the HTML+ DTD_ and wanted get peoples comments.

BTW: I would like to give a big thanks to Dave Raggett for doing a great
job on the HTML+ DTD_.  From our random arguments and outrageous requets
(tables, forms, ...) Dave has really pulled HTML+ together.  Any idea when
it'll be stable enough to start developing browsers for?

Looking forward to the Workshop next month,

The CONTROL panel would certainly help me.  But I'd want the 
addresses of the links to be outside the document, and the
entries in the CONTROL panel to work like entities.  You'd
say somewhere in the HEAD section that the standard links
you wanted were NEXT PREVIOUS UPALEVEL, and only those links
would appear in the browser (frame?).  

For the browser to know where NEXT PREVIOUS etc are, it needs
a navigational info file; that file has to be referred to
in the HEAD section where these links are specified.  Does
all this resolve to a URL type?

Is there any way to run Xmosaic on a sun running openview (as shipped by sun) 
rather than a full X system - 

Failing that can someone mail me a list of what I need to get Xmosaic running, 
as a hint - I'd rather not have to ftp the whole of X over a 9600 baud
link to my development machine :-)

But then you can't control the look of the nav panel (hey <NAV>),
e.g., I want to use by bookmark icon for navigation:

<NAV> 
<A HREF="/bookmark/server_bookmark/demo.html:Index_Page/demo.html:Index_Page/page2.html:Page_2">
<IMG SRC="/server/bookmark/bookmark.xbm" ISMAP></A>
</NAV>

Can you explain why you want the links to be "outside the document"?
I don't understand how this makes it better (I assume it has something
to do with autonavigation without using a server or something).
I'm not against supporting that but we need to figure out how to make
it work while still allowing complete customization of the NAV panel
(perhaps via a REL in the link <A REL="nav" HREF="http:...">???).

I have no idea where this is going.  Terry, since you know what you
want can you see how this might be accomplished?

Having browsers execute code is *very* scary.  Servers generally run
(or should run -- no reason not to) as userid 'nobody', and as such
can cause practically no damage to anything.  In any case, server
writers have much more knowledge about what's going to happen and what
could happen while writing a server than client users do while just
randomly clicking hyperlinks.  I don't see as there's any reason to
think that client-side execution is safer.

I don't recall having seen anything like this, so here goes...

  text/x-html; xmosaic %s
  text/x-html; xmosaic %s; compose=htmlcompose %s;\
     description="HTML Hypertext generated by tkWWW 0.8"

Where htmlcompose is... 

  #!/bin/sh

  WWW_HOME=$1.html export WWW_HOME

  cat >$WWW_HOME <<!!EOF!!
  <title>HTML generated for `whoami`@`hostname`.`domainname` by TkWWW</title>
  <h1>Type your message in here!</h1>
  !!EOF!!

  tkWWW -wwwnoinfo
  mv $1.html $1

The only drawback with using tkWWW this way is that you have
to go through the "generate source" & "save source" dialogs
to get your HTML exported.

Suggestion:

One way to get around this would be to have a command line option 
(say -wwwsource) that told it just to act as an HTML editor, reading
in $1 and dumping the exported HTML automatically on exiting.

Martin

PS An "insert file" option would be quite nice too!

X-Md4-Signature: ef0652d108a79c4a4f6661df6cb97ef2

NCSA httpd version 0.4 is now available at:

  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/ncsa_httpd/ncsa-httpd-0.4.tar.Z

This server has the following features:

    o Directory index support.
    o Access logging.
    o Group annotation server support.
    o Drop-in Gopher replacement support.
    o Simple and lightweight; easy to compile.
    o Clean; returns files without ever mutating their data.

Changes from 0.3 include the following:

    o Added annotation server support.  See README.GROUP-ANNOTATIONS.
    o Added access logging capability.
    o Added HTTP/1.0 compatibility (3rd+ args of GET command ignored).
    o Changed handling of full hostnames.
    o Fixed bug with index.html not being recognized unless a trailing
      slash was appended to the directory name.
    o Fixed bug with extraneous null appended to end of file data
      stream.
    o Fixed bug handling directory URL's with trailing slashes.
    o Made a little more Ultrix-friendly.

We recommend that sites currently using version 0.3 of this server
upgrade and encourage people to experiment with the annotation server
support.  As noted in the README, the annotation server support is
purely experimental and may be changed substantially in the future.

Please send comments or bug reports to httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Your
comments are greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Marc (on behalf of Rob, Eric, and himself)

One use is for <BR> with <P CENTER> to get some centred lines, but which
all belong to the same logical paragraph.

I'm not sure that most people would agree with your preference to explicitly
invoking a fixed pitch font.

Rather than an <R> tag, I would like to augment the EMPH rendering hints to
include additional font types beyond TT. This has a certain feeling of
completeness to it. The obvious step is to then also include the same font
attributes in PRE (defaulting to fixed pitch), i.e.

<!ATTLIST PRE
    id      ID      #IMPLIED -- link destination --
    style   CDATA   #IMPLIED -- various styles --
    tr      (tr)    #IMPLIED -- render in serif (Times Roman) font --
    hv      (hv)    #IMPLIED -- render in sans serif (Helvetica) font --
    width   NUMBER  #IMPLIED -- e.g. 40, 80, 132 -->

e.g.
        <PRE TR>
                Name
                Address
                Telephone
        </PRE>        

With PRE right aligned text would only work in a particular window size.
PRE stops the browser from being able to adjust margins etc. to get the
alignment ok for the current window size. I would therefore like to allow
greater flexibility for normal paragraphs via rendering hints, e.g. your
example becomes:

        <P INDENT>
        Name<BR>
        Address<BR>
        Telephone.

The change to a container model for the P tag ensures that the scope is well
defined. The style attribute for PRE should be retained so that authors can
indicate the logical role of the preformatted text in an extensible manner.

On the subject of changing fonts, thanks for your comments on using the SGML
external entity mechanism.

As far as Latin-1 goes it is a simple matter to map entity definitions to an
8-bit ASCII code. More generallt, this breaks down into two parts:

    a)  mapping the entity name to a character code and char set

    b)  how to render fonts in this char set (at least for the
        character codes needed for the current document)

It would be neat if we could use outline fonts for this. From the point
of view of HTML+ all that is needed is (a). The rest is a matter for the
protocol spec. Perhaps for now we need a mechanism like #INCLUDE that
works across the network. This could be implemented using the LINK tag.

Tell me more about the reasons people were asking for this feature.

It seems to me that Next and Previous can be adequately handled using
the existing framework:

    a)  defined by LINK elements with REL attribute
    b)  sequences defined with the GROUP tag in the parent doc

These will need to be clarified in the RFC for HTML+.

Urh, whats wrong with the LINK element, e.g.

        <LINK rel="up" href=...>
        <LINK rel="prev" href=...>
        <LINK rel="next" href=...>

The links specified with the LINK tag are assumed to be global to the
entire document and so could be automatically added to a menu or toolbar.

Gee thanks. I have just started to write HTML+ up as an RFC which attempts
to clarify the details of the format and how it should be handled by browsers.
This should be ready within three/four weeks.

p.s. Tim's spec seems to have the attribute named "REV" but "REL" seems
more appropriate. Any comments anyone?

This seems like the right approach.  We'd like to use it to
define a linear sequence, for example, the sections of a chapter.
However, we should probably be sure to distinguish "next" and "prev" 
from "forward" and "back", which have to do with the navigational
sequence.

In a previous message, you 
mentioned using the GROUP tag also for this purpose.  Can you
explain use of the GROUP tag?  I'd like to use the GROUP tag to
is define a set of links shared by a set of documents, such as
chapters all containing links to a table of contents, or a glossary.

Thanks.

A while back I suggested that we modify libwww to support variable
substitution in URLs, e.g., if "$xyz" is embedded in a URL, then
the browser should look in its internal symbol table and substitute
the value of variable "xyz" before dereferencing the URL.

Such a mechanism would make it easy to support dynamic links, e.g.,
<A HREF="$home">Home</A> uses a builtin variable "home".

We took a first cut at modifying libwww for this, and we're now using
it in our Windows NT browser (not for home and previous links, but for
variables set dynamically by embedded widgets -- for this we also use
simple conditionals in URLs).

Perhaps this already exists, and I missed it in the documentation.
If the developers put their stuff in directory trees made up of keywords:

Then, I can find him in the index when I search for thingy.
I'm sure this has all been covered, but howso?   I missed it.

If you have a number of chapters (with one document per chapter) which all
share same table of contents, then one approach is to insert a link in each
chapter to the table of contents. This is ok, but a pain to maintain. It
would in many cases be much nicer to define the structure of the book in 
one place, with pointers to the table of contents and the various chapters.

The GROUP tag can be used to define hierarchical groupings of tagged elements
such as chapters, appendices and so on. When you follow a link into a book
defined in this way, the browser can keep track of the context, and show
menu items or toolbar buttons for the table of contents etc. The idea needs
to be thought through in more detail, and is still a bit rough ...

e.g. in the document book.html

     <GROUP type="table of contents">
        <TITLE>Your Dog! </TITLE>

        <A REL="partof" href="preface.html"> Preface </A>

        <GROUP type="chapters">
          <UL>
            <LI> <A REL="partof" href="chap1.html"> Introduction </A>
            <LI> <A REL="partof" href="chap2.html"> So you want a dog </A>
            <LI> <A REL="partof" href="chap3.html"> Your new arrival </A>
            <LI> <A REL="partof" href="chap4.html"> Training </A>
            ...
          </UL>
        </GROUP>

        <GROUP type="appendices">
            ...
        </GROUP>
     </GROUP>

Rather than simple lists of elements, it seems nicer to allow a range of
markup so that the hierarchy can be viewed directly. The REL="partof"
attribute indicates that the associated document "belongs" to this group,
rather than simply a referenced work. You can therefore build up hierarchies
extending across a collection of documents.

The order in which such parts appear in the markup defines a browse sequence
and imply NEXT and PREV links when viewing these documents. This is
independent of the use of the UL element as seen above.

Note that a given document could be part of several different books. The
appropriate link to follow when the user presses NEXT depends on how the
current document was reached. Perhaps we need to extend the A tag to allow
authors to specify which context is intended for ordinary cross references.

Some more thought is needed on exactly how the browser knows which LINK
elements are implied, i.e. what menu items to show for a given document.

Dave Raggett

Subject: Link info outside doc

Here's why I'd like to be able to store the link info outside the 
document.  I have documents that have a set order (chapters of a 
book, chunks of chapters of a book) and that all need NEXT and 
PREVIOUS links.  In the present HTML, I have to (don't I?) provide
the URLs for the next and previous documents in each document.
This is tedious and prone to error.

I'd like to be able to provide a list of the docs in order, then
in each doc just specify that it should have a NEXT and PREVIOUS
link.  Then the browser can refer to the list of files and find
the right URL.  If I want to change the order I can reorder the
list of docs, without having to go into every file and change
the URLs.  

Is there a way to do this in HTML+ that I have missed?

In either case you should probably **seriously** think about running
in a chroot()'ed environment (which requires root perms to setup
of course).

Also, what about DOS environments (et.al.) where you have neither file
permissions nor chroot().  I think you are just SOL.

One of our local developers is trying to make use of the MacWWW sources
that are distributed from info.cern.ch.  He has had problems finding
all of the peices in the distribution.  Has anyone else had this problem?
Is the distribution really missing peices?  If it is, and I will assume
that for the moment, who shall I contact to get a complete distribution set?

Anyone have a good "getting started on the web" document for people not
on the web?  It should talk about what browsers are available and where
to get them from.

If not I think I'll write one.

Right, this is needed for picking up "threads" of documents to print
out the whole meta-document.  I'm not suggesting we should replace this.

I just think it would be fun to allow the document to define it's own
look for the navigation panel using normal HTML commands.  This could
co-exist with <LINK REL> with no problem.

Now that WWW has hypermedia capibilities wouldn't it be nice to have a nice
collage (sp?) of developers faces.  I'm also sort of mystified as to how
everyone looks and would rather avoid all of the suprise at the upcoming
developers conference.  I will therefore take the lead and publish my
face as a URL. (No laughing please!)

gopher://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/g9/cwis/people/Lou.Montulli.gif

These URL's (which I hope every developer or team will submit) could be
added to the WWW people document that Tim maintains or everyone could
put together a seperate document containing info about themselves, 
their organization, etc.  This may also help to convey a more humanistic
view of developers instead of the arcane mystic view that most non-programers
hold.

Maybe in the future we will have to remove our pictures so that our fame
doesn't cause mob scenes everywhere we go.  I here Michael Jackson has
a big problem with that :)

Web Faces

Yes, I agree.  Maybe we could digitize "faces" at the workshop? If someone
just brings a video camera we can grab frames later and send them back
the person for publishing.  Is anyone willing to do this, or am I the only
one without a digitizer?


Net Access at Workshop?
=======================

I expect Dale etc already thought of this but just in case...

Are we going to have Internet access at the Workshop?  I might be able to
provide temporary copies of BSD/386 if someone else (Dale?) could provide
some PCs with network cards.  I'll be in Tuesday night and would be willing
to pop down and help install/setup whatever (this holds true even if you
don't need BSD/386 for the PCs, I will be willing to help out in whatever
way I can, just let me know, I'll be around Saturday also).

I want something like this, maybe not this syntax but the semantics:

<HEAD>
    <TITLE>document</TITLE>
    <LINK rel="up" href=...>
    <LINK rel="prev" href=...>
    <LINK rel="next" href=...>
</HEAD>
<NAV>
    <A REF="up"><IMG SRC="/img/up.gif"></A>
    <A REF="prev"><IMG SRC="/img/prev.gif"></A>
    ...
</NAV>

This lets you specify how the navigation panel looks so the browser doesn't
have to grok special link relationships (up, prev, next) for this purpose.
I think this is a big win because if you hardcode up,prev,next that will
pretty much squelch any development on new navigation models.  I want to
be able to pop up a compass rose for navigating map data, or the image of
a book to turn pages etc.  Each class of document has it's own navigation
needs and I think hardcoding this in the browser is a bad idea.  This
could be done with having a bunch of rel attributes and having the browser
select the look based on the available LINK's but I don't think anyone
is likely to implement that and it still doesn't let you create nav's on
the fly.  I don't have the "solution" I'm just presenting the problem
that I would like to solve (dynamic nav panels).

Is anyone else interested in being able to build the look of the
navigation panel on the fly?  This could mesh quite nicely with
the LINK rel stuff if done right.

We are involved in some work on safe Tcl which will become part of
active email under MIME.  The idea is that a subordinate Tcl interpreter
can be created that is restricted only to operations that are safe --
file access, forking, etc, are unavailable.  The "regular" Tcl interpreter
can also export commands to the safe interpreter which are executed
in the regular interpreter's environment -- totally analogous to an
operating system's system calls.

I am about to post a secure Tcl experimenter's kit to comp.lang.tcl.

It would be a good candidate, IMHO, for delivering active HTML messages
(i.e. programs) that can be executed safely, even though the sender
isn't trusted.

HyperText Transfer Protocol, a simple stateless protocol based on
request-response of MIME messages and associated with the World Wide
Web project, has need of security services (e.g. authentication) in
order to allow things like information protection, modification or
annotation, and possibly compensated commercial information exchange
(in the medium to far future).

The two obvious approaches seem to be Kerberos (widely used and
oriented towards providing security for client-server relationships)
and PEM (not as widely used yet, oriented towards providing protection
for MIME objects such as messages.)

I'm attempting to put together a reasonably fair assesment of
potential advantages and problems for each of three different methods
for providing security:
   - Kerberos
   - PEM with symmetric cryptography only
   - PEM with asymmetric cryptography

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone with some knowledge about the
application and implications about each of these approaches
(preferably something more than I can have, which consists of a casual
reading of the pertinent RFCs, drafts, FAQs, and the like) regarding
how readily the necessary support structure can be/is being put in
place, how important the various services each offers is, how
potentially extensible each is, and that kind of thing.  If people
care, I can post the resulting document and let the flames begin. :-)

(For that matter, if someone knows a much better method that I didn't
know about, let me know about that too.)

Something I would like to see is libraries (I don't know if you have
them or not).  They could be specified through MIME, I guess, and
would be a combination of ID and ``place to get them from if you don't
already have them''.  For instance, say I want interactive hypertext,
I could use a set of libraries that have already been written and
debugged, rather than including the same code in every single
interactive hypertext document.

This would lead to:
  -- standardisation of code (a Good Thing).  C is intelligable
     because libc.a provides a common set of ground rules without
     which every program's source would bloat enormously.
  -- local copies of libraries, to avoid repetitive and time-consuming
     delays fetching libraries over a long-haul network for each
     document.
  -- quick boot-strapping.  If a couple of useful libraries for text
     and interactive graphics were available, more users would be
     willing to start the gentle slope of the learning curve.

Subject: Re: searchable index of the web


A very incomplete index of the web is located at
http://sturgeon.mit.edu:8001 as part of the Usenet University -- New
Network Academy.  The way that this index works is that items are
assigned a "coverage code" 010 being a general index of everything on
the net to 120 which is an item (for example, a question in a Usenet
FAQ) and are sorted from most general reference to least general.

That way the first items returned by a search are the most general
ones corresponding to your search, and so you don't have the problem
as with veronica and archie of searching for "Law" and getting
overloaded with individual treaties.

Subject: NCSA Mosaic for X 1.2 available.

Version 1.2 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, is now available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/xmosaic-source/xmosaic-1.2.tar.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sun.Z

                            .../xmosaic-diffs/xmosaic-1.1-1.2-diffs.Z

I'm flirting with fate by putting this out right before I fly to a
conference for the rest of the week, but it seems to be stable.  Any
serious bugs will be fixed this weekend.

Changes since 1.1 include:

 o Binary transfer mode, when on, now forces all files to be treated as
   binary, whether or not their extensions are recognized.  (Due to
   overwhelming popular request.) 
 o Gopher file types are now picked up on the basis of file extension, if a
   file extension exists, with the default being the normally assumed
   type.  This means that "foo.ps" returned as type '0' (text) is interpreted
   as PostScript, etc.  Resource tweakGopherTypes (default True) can be
   set to False to turn this off and interpret Gopher documents stricly by
   the Gopher typing system.  
 o Resource postscriptViewerCommand is now "dump" by default.  This
   is because ghostview (the previous default), as currently shipped, runs
   ghostscript in unsafe mode and a malicious PostScript file could cause
   damage to your filesystem as a result.  
 o Added fullHostname resource to allow explicit setting of the fully
   qualified hostname (machine.domain).  We recommend you don't use
   this resource (allow Mosaic to determine your full hostname on the
   fly) unless your system chokes on gethostbyname().  
 o Fixed problem with annotationServer resource set and annotation
   server not available or network down.  
 o Fixed problem with missing title (or author) in annotation.  
 o Fixed occasional coredump in File->Reload.  
 o Fixed occasional crash with inlined images after windows have been
   closed.  
 o Made failure of gethostbyname() robust (coredumps actually inside
   gethostbyname() must still be dealt with by the gethostbynameIsEvil
   resource).  
 o Fixed coredump when checking for editable annotation property when
   document contains no text.  
 o Fixed coredump when closing window if hotkey is hit while window
   is still open but in the process of being destroyed.  
 o Local files should now always be automatically canonicalized into a
   full URL of form file://hostname/full/path/filename -- this applies to
   command-line arguments and to filenames passed through
   File->Open.
 o Now recognize file://localhost/ scheme for expressly accessing local
   files.  
 o Fixed problem with multiline FTP server responses (courtesy John
   Ockerbloom).  
 o Fixed problem with ".." in FTP directory resulting in slash falling off
   of toplevel URL and subsequent jumps failing.  
 o Fixed problem with trailing slashes in FTP directory specifications
   that were causing part of the directory name to be used twice.  
 o Changed sgimoviePlayerCommand default to movieplayer, which
   actually exists on some SGI systems.  
 o Made a few changes to menubar Documents and Help menus.  
 o Cleaned up lots of typecasting warnings in Xmx code.  
 o Fixed problem with Motif 1.2 and file insertions in annotate window.  
 o Fixed problem with double quotes in titles of group annotations.  
 o Added resource reverseInlinedBitmapColors to allow reversal of
   foreground and background colors in inlined XBM bitmaps.  
 o Fixed problem with group annotations on URL's containing pound
   signs (normally this never happens, but it will happen for HDF files in
   Mosaic 2.0).  
 o Added confirmation box for deleting annotations from the menubar;
   added resource confirmDeleteAnnotation, defaults to true.  
 o Correctly recognizes mis-suffixed HTML files starting with <head>,
   <html>, and <HTML> tags also now.  
 o XPM3-format inlined image support fixed.  

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DECstation 5000-200 (Ultrix).
  DEC Alpha (OSF/1 1.2).

Rumor has it that Mosaic will compile on systems like:

  Hewlett Packard HP/UX 7.x, 8.x, 9.x.
  Dell SVR4
  Sun Solaris 2.x
  SCO Open Desktop
  Harris Nighthawk
  NeXT BSD

Documentation is available online within Mosaic.  Comments, questions,
and bug reports should be sent to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in
advance for any feedback you can provide.

Subject: HTML based help

Hi out there

being new to the list and the subject I would like to ask you experts to set
some pointers for me.

I am looking for two kinds of applications related to each other:

- a hypertext document retrieval system (with and without network capabilities)
- a hypertext context sensitive help system

After a first look at xmosaic I am asking myself whether it is possible to use it
unchanged for the former problem and use a 'subset' of xmosaic for the latter
(a hypertext browser or -library).

I want to support Macs (partly with AU/X), PCs (Windows, Desqview/X),
and Unix boxes (Sun, SGI, mips) either with the
same X11 based application using all the available Xservers on these platforms,
or using architecture dependent applications.

Any suggestions/experiences/ideas on that?

Thank you very much in advance for your help

As well as URLs of pictures, URLs of bios or submissions of short  
bios of WWWWizards would be apreciated.  The WWW People list in
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People.html> is getting really
out of date, so included yourself if you aren't there.
I edit it with the NextStep editor, which doesn't handle
inline images :-( so Arthur or I will just put links to pics for now.

I have written down some ideas on how the news system might benefit from the 
web, and (particularly in the area of public annotations) vice-versa.  It's a 
bit long to mail out, but it's here:

   <a href="http://info.cern.ch/roeber/webnews.html">
     http://info.cern.ch/roeber/webnews.html
   </a>

For those who don't read news because of the volume, I'd note that the WAIS-like 
selection system I propose would allow much tighter filtering than is currently 
done.

I'd love to hear any ideas, feedback, etc.

Frederick.

I think your solution is to keep a database of what files
are in which book(s).  You run a special server which
will automatically append the navigation information
from the database.   HTML is a delivery format.
It does not have to be your storage format.

This weighting of the generality of a node is very interesting,
especially for indexes.

How were the entries in your index collected -- by hand,
or by a traversal of the web?

Hi all,

I have been trying to set up the CERN httpd server on a SUN IPX with
SunOS 4.1.3.

Unfortunately it does't work out that well for me. I have tried various
combinations of the library and daemon versions in the archive at
info.cern.ch. Could anybody with a SUN and a working httpd tell me what
version they got working?

Thanks,

The HTML spec has *both* REL and REV.   Both attributes can be lists
of relationships.  The occurence of a relationship in the REV  
(reverse) list indicates a relationship in th ereverse direction.
Otherwise, you have to have a convention for indicating logically
reverse relationships (eg is-child; has-child) or some
out of band system for knowing that

	A  is-parent-of	B

implies and is implied b by

	B  is-child-of	A

Is there any document where REV is present withouit REL?

Folks:

Cello beta version 0.6 is hereby released, and available for anonymous
FTP from fatty.law.cornell.edu in the /pub/LII/Cello directory.

For those who missed earlier announcements and versions, Cello is an
all-purpose Internet browser which incorporates WWW, Gopher, FTP,
Telnet, and News clients along with the ability to use many other
services through gateways.

The new version addresses the following problems:

-- CTRL-Backspace will now generate the DEL character (ASCII 0x7F) in
the Telnet client, which apparently some users of UN*X systems badly
need.

-- Various problems with tabbed text in assorted monospaced text modes
were fixed.

-- Problems with WHOIS searches launched from within Gopher are now
fixed.

-- A minor problem in which the scrollbar would hang at the bottom of
a document was repaired.

-- The usual rogue's gallery of GPFs and assorted weirdness were laid
to rest.

Thanks as usual to all the Alert Cellists who spotted and reported
problems, suggested features, and otherwise are keeping me on my toes.

Regards,
Tb.

I have written a perl script that wanders the WWW collecting URLs, keeping
tracking of where it's been and new hosts that it finds.  Eventually,
after hacking up the code to return some slightly more useful information
(currently it just returns URLs), I will produce a searchabe index of this.
There is a complete list of all the sites it has found at

<a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/afs/sipb/user/mkgray/ht/comprehensive.html">
A complete list of sites found by the W4 (World Wide Web Wanderer)
</a>

I'll announce here when we get this index properly running, however it probably
won't be until sometime in August, as I am going on vacation.  Until then...

This sounds good, better than depending on my memory.  Will w4
crack open an log the <Title> or is this directory tree oriented?
If I'm running a server, how will you know to wander to it?  
Should there be a web of wanderers (w5?) so w4e in Europe can
feed from w4u in the US, etc?  Why is this topic such a quiet one?

Darn, I wanted to do that.  So, how "big" is the Web?  Can you figure out
stuff like "width" (distance between documents)?

Wouldn't it be better if you could just ask each server for it's
connectivity? Seems like this would make things run a **lot** faster.
Since each server has local access to all the information it could
just find all the HREFs real quick, unique them and report to
someone else.

>>>> Dale & TimBL <<<<
This would be a good topic to cover at the workshop.

I was shocked to see how few home pages I've visted.  I really need to
get out more often :-)  Then I noticed that they all have the :port
which mans it's not the same.  Marc, when doing annotations and
checking the "visited" list maybe you should ignore :80 on http:
servers?

We need to do something anyway.  With annotations you can get really
lost in the Web.

Ok, how "big" is the Web.  Here is what W4 has found out.
Actually, first I'd better explain a little bit about what the wanderer does.
It does a simple depth first search, with an added feature I call 'getting
bored'.  That is, if it finds a number of documents that have the same
URL, up to the last field (eg http://foo/bar/blah, http://foo/bar/baz, 
http://foo/bar/more) it will eventually get 'bored' and skip it.  This makes
it go a little quicker.  Of course, it potentially is losing some documents
here, but probably not.

W4 took many hours (maybe 20) to run, but I don't remember exactly, because it
saves state so I could kill it and restart it whenever I wanted.  Well, in
total, the W4 found more than 17,000 http documents (didn't follow any other
kinds of links) and more than 125 unique hosts.  In the current version,
it *only* retrieved the URL of the document.
In the next version, I hope to have it do the following other things.

o	Get the <title>Title</title> of the document
o	Get the length of the document
o	Do a 'keyword' analysis of the document
o	Count the number of links in a document
o	Improve on the boredom system

By a 'keyword' analysis, I mean looking at the document for words that
appear frequently, but aren't normally common words.  Additionally, titles
and things appearing in headers would be good candidates for keyword searches.
I'll try and get the current code at least clean enough that I'm willing to
let everyone in the world to see it, but if you *really* want to see it now,
send me mail.  Any other suggestions would be welcome.

Once this index is produced, it will be searchable via http, and I suppose
by WAIS though I really detest the way WAIS restricts searches.  In any case,
there is a possibility that this will be done by the end of the summer.

Yup.  And 70 for Gopher servers.  And WAIS gateways should be
equivalenced.  And trailing periods in machine names should be
ignored.  And trailing slashes in directory names.  And...

Big problem; hopefully solved by URN's; planning on patching the hell
out of libwww2 for Mosaic 2.0 to try to do as much as possible though.
