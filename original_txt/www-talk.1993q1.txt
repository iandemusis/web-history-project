I hope to give more detailed feedback soon, but an immediate suggestion is
to include a size field giving the number of bytes in the complete message
(or an estimate). This would allow the browser to show a gauge indicating
how much of the message has been received at any time (I want to temporarily
replace the vertical scroll bar by a bas-relief thermometer). The gauge
would only be shown if this size field is present.

This is helpful when getting a large document or when the comms link is
slow, e.g. if you are using a modem link. An additional benefit is in
helping the browser to manage its resources more effectively, e.g.
reduce need for reallocs and when to use a disk buffer rather than a memory
image for very large documents.

A second suggestion to improve the ergonomics of WWW is to let users know
when an expensive operation is being conducted by the server, e.g. document
format conversion, complex database search, or access via a "slow" gateway.
The underlying principle is that users don't mind if performance is slow
provided they know what to expect.

My suggestion is that part of the message header is sent before beginning
the document conversion (or whatever). The remainder and the document body
content is sent later. The part of the header sent earlier on includes a
processing attribute, e.g. "Processing: converting to html ..."

Best wishes for a happy new year,

Subject: HP's SGML hypertext help system

Long description of HP HelpTag SGML format for hyptertext help system
=====================================================================

I have just been shown HP's new hyptext help system for VUE 3 (HP's user
desktop environment for X11, Motif). It uses SGML for the authoring language
and is a very professionally package. The group may be interested in its
scripting language which has a lot of similarities with HTML, although it
isn't a networked application.

Unlike WWW, the HP Help system requires you to compile the source files. It
does this to compile keyword indexes and to provide a more compact format.
The HP Help system's features appear to draw heavily on Microsofts help
system for Windows 3 on the PC.

For full information order the "HP Help System Developer's Guide"
part number B1171-90055 from an HP supplier.

Summary features:

    o   multi font
    o   multi language  (defaults to ISO 8859-1 character set)
    o   resizeable - reformats to match new window size
    o   keyword indexes (see below)
    o   glossaries
    o   hypertext links to anchors in same and other help volumes
    o   figures with captions (tiff, x bitmap, x pixmap, x window dump: xwd)
    o   small inline graphics
    o   optional text flow around figures
    o   control over launching new window or changing view in current window
    o   It doesn't support networked hypertext links.
    o   richer use of SGML than HTML
    o   metainfo section at front of help volume

The keyword index mechanism is similar to that on Windows 3. You choose
search from a menu, and a dialog box appears. The index is an alphabetical
list of important words and phrases along with a list of each occurrence in
the help volume.

The dialog allows you to type the first few letters and see matching
keywords. You can then click on a keyword to see a list of matching topics.
You then click on a topic name to view that topic. This approach allows
you to explore what keywords are available, unlike the W3 and WAIS approach
which leave you in the dark!

Glossary terms are shown with a dashed underline. Clicking on such a term
pops up a small dialog box with an explanation from the glossary. The
glossary itself is defined separately, rather than embedding each
explanation with each term.

Help volumes have the following generic structure:

<helpvolume>

    <metainfo>

    <title> Volume title

    <copyright>
    Copyright topic goes here ...

    <abstract>
    The abstract describing your help system goes here.

        .
        .   There may be other meta information topis.
        .

    <\metainfo>

    <hometopic> Home topic title
                Body of home topic goes here ...

        <s1> Title of First Subtopic goes Here
             Body of first subtopic goes here ...

        <s2> Title of Second Subtopic goes Here
             Body of second subtopic goes here ...

         .
         .
         .

    <glossary>
    The body of the glossary, which contains term definitions, goes here ...

<\helpvolume>


Notes:
=====

    a)  The ETAGO (end tag open) uses "<\" rather than "</"

    b)  frequent use is made of entity declarations
        e.g. <!entity MyPic FILE "picture.tif">

    c)  &< gives "<", &\ gives "\", && gives "&"

    d)  title text is typically terminated by end of line
        rather than an end tag, e.g. <hometopic>

    e)  many tags support an id attribute for defining anchors
         <chapter>, <figure>, (idx>, <image>, <item>, <location>,
         <otherfront>, <p>, <rsect>, <s1> ... <s9>

    f)  many tags support the shorthand <tag|text| for <tag>text<\tag>


The full set of tags is:

    Meta info:

    <metainfo> ... <\metainfo>
    <title>
    <copyright>
    <abstract> ... <\abstract>
    <otherfront>        (other front matter)

    Structure of a help volume:

    <!entity>

    <rsub>              (reference subsection heading)
    <otherhead>

    <image> ... <\image> (keep line breaks, no wrapping or justification)
    <term>text<\term>   (occurrence of glossary entry - shorthand ++text++)
    <user>response<\user> (distinguishes user input in example dialog)
    <var>text<\var> (distinguishes user supplied variable, shorthand %%text%%)

    <p>                 (paragraph, optionally wrapped around a graphic)
    <quote>text<\quote> (language dependent directional quote marks)

I agree; a size field is almost essential -- particularly considering
how big hypermedia documents are going to get.

Another possibility for increased ergonomics is to provide for the
transfer of the first several paragraphs of a large document prior to
transfer of the rest of the document, so the use has something to look
at while the bulk of the communication is taking place.

Cheers,
Marc

Subject: Re:  Questions about WAIS, WAISGate

Turns out that using a rule file in waisgate is a Big Win.  I have a
rule file that looks like this:

  map /n/abyss/2/doc/rfc-src/* http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:82/rfc/*.html
  map /n/dinosaur/0/doc/text/* http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/*
  map /n/abyss/2/doc/man-src/* http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/man/*
  map /usr/spool/news/*	     http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/usr/spool/news/*

I changed WAISGate to tear the WAIS docid apart and pass the
distributor local path to HTTranslate.  If it matches, it gets
rewritten.  If rewritten, the address is used as is, else it goes
through the usual waisgate things.  This way I can index things that
are really served through a gateway of some sort (eg, a rfc converter
that we just wrote).

I'll post the stuff next week sometime.  If you're interested, see 
<A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/information/information.html">. 
There are the usual links to things there, plus hypertext versions of
man pages, RFCs, IENs and FAQ's from news.answers.  Tom's working on
something to parse the FAQ files into something more reasonable.  I'm
working on a gateway for our problem reporting system (so that a
hypertext article about our current status could refer people to
problem reports for more details) and other misc. stuff.  If you have
comments or suggestions, we'd love to hear them!

Does someone have stuff for converting emacs info to html?  I thought
I saw some references to something, but can't find them now.

I have stuff for converting *texinfo* to html.  You should be able to
watch the result starting at

	http://voorn.cwi.nl/texinfo/dir.html

Mail me if you want the source (it's written in a less than well-known
language, Python, for which you'll need to get an interpreter first).

   ----------< Bunyip News (year-end edition) >------------


A warm and non-denominational Season's Greetings to all!

Alan has already sent out our "Bunyip Xmas Card", but I'd
like to add a few words, as well. In particular, I thought
I'd share some news about where we are and where we're
going in the next little while with you who have help so
much in supporting our little enterprise. In all the
excitement of getting a company off the ground it's
sometimes easy to loose sight of where we're heading and
so I'd like to spend a few minutes checkpointing our
progress with those of you who have done so much to get us
where we are today.


New Additions to the Gang...
-----------------------------

Bunyip has definitely taken on a life of its own, with not
one, but two new employees joining the family full time in
the past two months.

Wanda Pierce began working for us full time in October and
will concentrate her initial efforts on product
development for a range of Internet user clients. Alan and
I have worked both back at the McGill School of Computer
Science for nearly five years and during our stay at the
McGill Computing Centre over the past 18 months, so she
_should_ know what she's getting into!  :-)

We have now embarked upon a rather ambitious program to
develop client tools to help ensure better access to
Internet information and Wanda will play a strategic role
in making sure are products in this area do what real
people want them to do. She has a interesting mixed
background in both Computer Science and Fine Arts and has
been tasked with keeping the company's techno-weenies in
line whenever she detects that they are forgetting the
needs of the "real" people using our programs.

We don't want to say too much more about this effort at
this point (basically, because we don't want to promise
vapourware) but hope to have more concrete announcements
about our information clients later in the coming year.

Bill Heelan has also joined the gang full time as of this
week to work on systems programming for a variety of
projects. Again, we have all worked together while at the
School of Computer Science and so he, too has been given
fair warning of what he's in for...

Those who have been following the archie story closely
(and like to read the credits at the end while everyone
else is filing out of the cinema) will recognize Bill as
one of the authors of the original archie implementation.
When we first decided to open Alan's nifty little database
to the world Bill was responsible for the first telnet
archie client program and as his first task for Bunyip has
taken over the final push to get the long-promised new
version of this component out the door.

This particular task has been in my lap for the past
several months but has languished "almost finished" for
some time as I've been swamped with company business (such
as organizing our orderly departure from the university,
negotiating final details with McGill for network access
after we move on in January, locating our new premises,
shopping for furniture, bookkeeping, etc).  I'm very
pleased to have Bill on line for "real work" since I'm
obviously going to devote more and more of my time to such
paper shuffling. The sad part is I can't get any sympathy
out of the rest of the gang for all the dross I help save
them from!

We estimate that we need only a few days of work to get
the last pieces of the client (output formatting and
paging) working and we're now hoping to get an initial
release of this badly needed piece out to the archie sites
at the start of January. This will give archie operators a
telnet client that speaks Prospero to the server (as do
all the freeware archie clients), reducing demand on
resources and giving better control over the load an
archie will put on your system.


Other archie news..
--------------------

So far, all but one of the original operators of archie
have taken on the supported version (and we're still
hoping to make that 100 percent in January!). In addition,
of course, there are a number of new additions to the
family who should be going operational in the new year.
We're obviously far from done developing archie and we'd
especially like to extend a big "Thank You" for this vote
of confidence to our customers in what is obviously still
an embryonic product line.

The current schedule calls for a number of improvements to
archie in the next month, including the long-awaited new
release of the telnet client. This will feature, among
other improvements, the new Prospero interface to reduce
the demand upon system resources plus the changes needed
to provide multiple language support. The Help system has
been completely redone (making it much easier to extend or
modify the Help text) and we've also added a ".archierc"
file to allow sites to better customize their installation.

Of course, as Alan has written earlier, there are also a
number of new additions at the server end, including
support for domain specific searches, plus pathname limits
on searches (allowing the user to specific only files that
match _and_ contain specific strings in the directory
path). This code is implemented in the current release but
is awaiting the final freeze on the Prospero protocol to
allow the clients to use it. Long promised, we're hoping
for good news on this from the Prospero group shortly.

We have also received a commission from one of the local
universities to prepare and operate a French-language
archie here in Montreal for an initial period of five
months. As part of this deal we will be able to license
the French translation to those needing it for an
additional fee.

Although we don't have plans to prepare additional
translations ourselves at this point, the telnet client is
being reworked specifically to make it easier to prepare
and operate foreign-language version for those customers
who wish to implement their own help text. Details will be
made available to those licensees who might be interested
in preparing their own text when the telnet client ships,
and of course we would be happy to investigate the
possibilities for translations of our text, if you'd
prefer.

Future plans also call for multiple database support,
greater browsing capability and a few more gadgets, but
these additional features are being held for the next
release, which will follow once Bill has it ready to roll.
We realize how important it is to get the Prospero client
out the door and don't want to hold up the release for
features which are less in demand at this point. Still,
the hooks are now in place and it is not expected to take
too long to fold them in and get a follow-up release out,
as well. As usual, your suggestions for further
improvements and additions are welcome.


New Services...
---------------

Also planned for January are at least one and hopefully
several new freely-available archie databases built using
the additional data-gathering and client capabilities of
the new release. Pending final approval after the holiday
period we appear to have secured a site here in Montreal
to host this new service and with Bill on board we finally
have the time needed to get this off the ground.

Once we have things up and running we plan to make the
additional data-gathering scripts available to archie
licensees wishing to extend their offerings. As with the
anonFTP database, we will be offering coordination and
communications services as part of our archie system
support. We'll post details of the new databases to the
archie-maint list in (hopefully) late January and those of
you with licenses can then decide if they want to extend
your range of wares. More on this below...


Other Projects...
------------------

As they say "Bunyip does not discuss unannounced projects"
but we have a number of other activities we are involved
in that we'd like to let you know about.


IETF:

Our largest timesink, outside of our efforts on archie of
course, is the volunteer work we do through the IETF. Both
Alan and I have been heavily involved with such efforts in
the past year and plan to continue this work in 1993.

Alan and I co-chaired the "Internet Anonymous FTP
Archives" working group to develop standardized templates
for entering descriptive information into anonFTP
archives. This working group came to completion at the
Washington IETF in October (or was it November? It's all
becoming a blur!) and we will now be coordinating efforts
to get such templates filled out and distributed on the
Internet throughout 1993.

Several volunteer sites have agreed to act as repositories
for such templates so smaller sites need not fill in
templates for the most common or popular packages (and to
help avoid wasteful duplication or misclassification
during the cataloging phase). A mailing list is also being
set up to coordinate donations and otherwise help the work
along.

Alan and I are also working closely with others in the
field of Internet resource discovery and access on a
number of basic research issues. Perhaps the most urgent
of these involve attempts to define and standardize
mechanisms for naming and referencing objects in an
internet environment.

Working with Joyce Reynolds and Russ Hobby (IETF Area
Directors for User Services and Applications,
respectively) Alan and I inaugurated a new working group
at the last session to develop what is currently being
referred to as "Uniform Resource Identifiers", which in
our lexicon include both "Locators" (pointers to
resources) and "Names" (a more nebulous concept, but
conceptually a location-independent identifier of the
information content of an object). Alan will co-chair the
working group with Jim Fullton of CNIDR, while I plan to
take an activist role as an advocate for a particular
mechanism for defining and creating URIs. For example, I
am currently working on a paper with Chris Weider of Merit
which will be our proposal for URNs.

This work is of more than academic interest to us here at
Bunyip since we plan to migrate all our Internet-based
projects towards the use of URIs as soon as they are
standardized. This would allow client programs, for
example, to perform searches in archie and directly pass
off the identifiers returned to compliant systems without
further processing or conversion. We have high hopes for
URIs and their component parts in the next few years as an
integrating force for future Internet tool development and
plan to keep Bunyip at the forefront of such development
work.


The WHOIS++ project:

Another major project of mine at the moment (and hopefully
a future product line for Bunyip) is my participation in
the WHOIS++ effort. This project came about as a result of
a BOF at the Boston IETF in July, in which a number of
people participated in an examination into the reasons for
the lack a practical directory service for the Internet.
X.500, which was supposed to fill this role, has never
taken off and there are still a number of major
impediments to its success.

After this BOF illuminated the problems (which seems as
much political as technical at this point), a small group
of us, including Joan Gargano of UCDavis, Jim Fullton of
CNIDR, Chris Weider of Merit, Simon Spero of UNC-Chapel
Hill and myself set out to architect and deploy a
light-weight and practical directory service that could
address the problems we see holding back x.500.

We believe that so far we've made excellent progress, with
no less than three papers now in draft form that explain
our solution starting down the path through the IETF
towards eventual RFC status. A new working group (the
WHOIS and Network Information Lookup Service Working
Group) has been set up to coordinate this work and had its
first meeting in Washington.

The heart of the new service (currently called "WHOIS++"
in honour of our original modest ambition to develop a
follow-on to the existing NIC WHOIS service) is a flexible
template oriented data model and an architecture that
allows the operator to use any database system desired for
holding the information to be served. The new system has
now moved far beyond its original modest goals, allowing
operators to define and serve _any_ template-like
information they desire.

We obviously hope and expect at least some sites to pick
up, index and serve collections of the newly created IAFA
templates. This will allow serving collections of
information about users, services, software packages and
more to the entire Internet. In addition to more extensive
and useful databases of information about anonFTP, we
foresee a range of other useful collections and a demo
facility for this service is an important part of our
plans for the

A pilot implementation of WHOIS++ is now deployed
at several sites for testing and our plan is to release the
public domain implementation of our work in January or
February.

Here at Bunyip we intend to offer a combination of archie
and a supported version of a WHOIS++ server as a new
addition to our product line, with preferential pricing
for those who already have archie to enable you to offer
distributed directory support at your site if you want it.
Details on this should be available in February or March.

The Buddy Project:

Alan is now working with Carl Malamud and others to set up
a "buddy project", in which individuals and institutions
will be able to act as sponsors or coordinators for
donations and other assistance aimed at newly connected
sites, especially in the developing world.  Alan has
already sent a first collection of donated books and other
materials to Estonia and as one of their first enlisted
volunteers I am currently gathering material to forward to
the University of Swaziland. In the new year.

It is hoped that this work will become a sponsored project
of the Internet Society, with a number of individual
coordinating projects feeding badly needed material where
it will do the most good. In the long run, Carl and Alan
have ambitious plans for organizing donations of
educational material and even hardware directly from
manufacturers, but to me the greatest potential in their
plans is for making available the expertise of individuals
to those who need it most. I expect we'll be hearing much
more about this project in 1993.



The Wrap-Up...


Well, that's a quick survey of the activities of Bunyip
over the past year, along with a few pointers towards
where we hope to see the company go in the new year. Now
we have Wanda and Bill on staff we expect to be able to
offer a much better level of user support to our existing
client base, while continuing the all-important research
and develop into new tools and services that we must
perform to keep alive (and keep up with the demand from
our users for a more useful Internet). I'd be happy to
pass on further information on any of the development
projects we're participating in through the IETF, and
would encourage anyone who is interested to join the
appropriate mailing lists and get involved. Even if you
can't make it to the meetings, you can have a real impact
on development with your comments and suggestions.



Peter's Soapbox
----------------

As for us, we promise to try to extract every possible
drop out of the funding we're receiving through archie
license fees to push out both an improved archie and our
related follow-on products. As I mentioned at the
beginning of this note, we're very grateful for the early
(and tangible!) support our licensees have show us and
will do our best to deliver value for money. Although we
are playing in perhaps one of the most interesting and
complex technological sandboxes available today, we
definitely hope to be perceived as a "people" company,
offering quality products and responding to our customer's
needs. 

As a small start-up it will obviously be hard to always
fulfill expectations but we're going to give it our best
shot. If we're _NOT_ performing up to scratch, please tell
us.  And if we are, as they say "Tell your friends"!

Enough drivel - may you all enjoy a happy holiday season
and a prosperous and successful new year.

Happy New year everyone...

Ooops!

The problem is in HTML.c, there should be an UPDATE_STYLE in as first line of  
list_element -- if not, a pargraph mark is written to a nonexistent text  
object. Happens when the very first printable thing is a list element.
Fixed routine is:

PRIVATE void list_element  ARGS3(void *, this, HTTag *,t, HTElement *,e)
{
    UPDATE_STYLE;
    if (e->tag != &tags[DIR_TAG])
	HText_appendParagraph(THIS->text);
    else
        HText_appendCharacter(THIS->text, '\t');	/* Tab @@ nl for UL? */
    THIS->in_word = NO;
}


It'll be fixed in the next release. 1.1a of the library, I suggest you fix this  
in your code now for speed.

We're hoping to do something like that.  I have a gateway to our local

I'm planning to extract the most severe problem reports from the list

Subject: new HTML spec, sample implementation
Date: Wed, 06 Jan 93 19:23:43 CST
From: Dan Connolly <connolly@pixel.convex.com>

I just uploaded the following to info.cern.ch:/pub/incoming
libHTML-930106.tar.Z
html_spec-930106.tar.Z

WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

* registering HTML with the IANA

The spec is a hypertext. We need a plain text document
for the IANA. This is complicated by the fact that
much of the spec is "by example," that is, tolerated.html
demonstrates the tolerated techniques much better than
it explains them.

But I think the files HTML.html, Text.html, and html.dtd
make a workable spec. html.dtd has all the information,
HTML.html motivates it, and Text.html gives enough background
to read it.

* bringing implementations into compliance

LineMode -- Tim: I'd like to use SGML_read to do the lexical
stuff in the linemode browser. I haven't thought much about
EBCDIC support, but it shouldn't bee too difficult. I think
SGML_read will fit neatly between HTParseFormat() and
HTGetCharacter().

NeXT browser -- Tim: I'd like to see the stuff on info.cern.ch
use the HEAD/BODY elements and &#60 in stead of &lt. If you
use the NeXT browser to maintain this stuff, or if anybody else
uses the NeXT browser, I'd like to see it brought up to date.

html-mode.el -- Marc: I have kept my copy of html.el up
to date as I have edited the spec. We should sync up.

MidasWWW -- Tony: I have kept my copy of midaswww up
to date as I have worked on the spec. We should sync up too.

Gateways -- Again, I request that anybody who provides
information to the web to keep their server up to date
with this spec. It's the only way to motivate updates
to clients!


Now about that last few changes to the HTML spec...

INLINE ELEMENTS

I added <em>, <samp>, <code>, and several other elements,
inspired by TeXinfo. We need these to support conventional
technical documentation. The list is not exhaustive, but
I think it's pretty good.


NUMERIC CHARACTER REFERENCES

I have learned a few things about SGML and made a few
decisions biased toward simplicity. As a result, I think
the spec is a little smaller and the sample implementation
is a little cleaner.

Most notably, I have introduced numeric character references
to the HTML spec. These were in SGML all along, but I didn't
understand them fully.

This raises the issue of character sets. The character set
in html.dtd is ISO646, i.e. ASCII. Everybody using html.dtd
agrees on the correspondence between the numerals 0-127
and the ASCII characters they represent. So to represent
a '<' character, we'll write "&#60;". This obsoletes
the lt, gt, and amp entities.

On the other hand, I did not include an 8-bit character set.
So the meaning of "&#255" is not defined. The HTML DTD references
"ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN" in stead of
"ISO Registration Number 109//CHARSET ECMA-94
Right Part of Latin Alphabet Nr. 3//ESC 2/13 4/3". So We'll write
"&yuml;" for the character that corresponds to position 255
in the ISO-8559 encoding.

In the sample implementation, numeric character references
are invisible to the application: the translation from
"&#60;" to '<' happens inside the SGML_read routine. On
the other hand, entity references like "&yuml;" are
handed back to the application for processing.

I too am interested in extending WWW to supports forms, perhaps based on
something like that used in Lotus NOTES. The basic idea is to define classes
of objects such as radio buttons, selection fields, input fields etc.
together with a library of predefined functions (e.g. to check a field
matches a date format) which can be used to build forms. The system is event
driven, and some behaviour is handled purely locally without recourse to the
form's server, for instance applying simple edits to input fields. Other
behaviour involves talking to the server using a simple messaging protocol.

An extreme case is represented by systems such as Hypercard (on MACs) and
Toolbook (PCs). These provide low level objects and scripting language. It
may be more appropriate to consider a higher level approach targetted more
closely at the needs for forms. A major driver for me is a room booking
system which also needs a mechanism for showing minute by minute changes to
the data without the user having to "pull" a fresh copy from the server.

I believe that WWW should be extended to support a richer variety of
documents including forms, equations, pictures and tables. This will take
time of course, but seems the right way to go. How to get there? I am
continuing to work on an HTML editor/browser (portable X11 + Xlib). There
is a lot of dull hard work to do in order to get an effective and reliable
editor.

Subject: dealing with new-lines
X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.1


How should browsers deal with new-lines, and where can html-generators
put in new-lines?

I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what is intuitively the right
way to do it, and I came up with this method.

0. Convert all new-lines inside of tags to spaces.

1. For each tag NOT in
     <PRE> </PRE> <A> </A> <PLAINTEXT>
   remove ALL surrounding new-lines.

2. For each tag in
     <PRE> <PLAINTEXT>
   remove ALL new-lines to left, and one new-line to the right.

3. For each tag in
     </PRE>
   remove ALL new-lines to the right.

4. Convert all remaining new-lines to spaces.

If XMP and LISTING sections are being used, they would be treated the
same as PRE.

Note that this converts new-lines around anchors into spaces UNLESS they
appear immediately at the beginning or end of some other element.

If browsers use this method, it would allow html-generators to put in
new-lines all over the place for readability of HTML, without introducing
lots of annoying extra spaces in the output.  This is what seems like
the most useful thing to do, although I'm not sure it is "correct".

So is it correct?  And are there any obvious flaws?

Darn good question. Your approach appears to have the correct
results, but I'm not sure it's practical for many implementations
(global search-and-replace operations are inconvenient for
sequential processing models), and it certainly isn't a healthy
way to think about SGML documents.

The way to think about SGML documents, IMHO, is this: the sequence
of characters comprising an SGML document are presented to an
SGML parser, which parses the markup from the data and passes
the "results" to the processing application.

[Much of this is covered in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Connolly/921203/Text.html
and what isn't there should be, but bear with me...]

So many of the details of the syntax of SGML are invisible to
the processing application: the fact that <>'s delimit tags
in stead of {}'s for example.

The information delivered to the application by the parser
is called the Element Structure Information Set. It contains
things like tags, attributes, attribute values, and data
characters.

So there are two questions, to my mind:
1. How does the SGML parser treat newlines?
2. How does the WWW processing application treat newlines?

Question 1 is answered by the SGML standard. Question 2
is for us to decide.

SGML defines several types of content, which determine
the kinds of markup that are recognized inside an element.
The simplest is EMPTY, for example:

<!ELEMENT P - O EMPTY>

When you see a P start tag, you know there is no content,
and you assume that a P tag follows, effectively.

The next simplest is CDATA, for example:

<!ELEMENT TITLE - - CDATA>

When you parse the content of a TITLE element, the only
thing you look for is an end tag. Everything else is
reported by the SGML parser as data characters.

Then there is RCDATA, which is just like CDATA, except
for character and entity references.

The most common content type is MIXED, where all kinds
of markup are recognized: tags, entities, as well as data.
For example:

<!ELEMENT ADDRESS - - (#PCDATA|A|P)>

The parser should report start tags, end tags, entities,
and data inside an ADDRESS element.

Then there is ELEMENT content, where only tags are
recognized, for example:

<!ELEMENT HEAD - -  (TITLE? & ISINDEX? & NEXTID?)>

The parser will report any data inside a HEAD element
as an error. But [and this is the reason I went through
this whole excercise] whitespace is ignored between
tags in element content. So the text:

<head>
<title>sample</title>
</head>

will be reported to the application by the parser as
a HEAD start tag,
a TITLE start tag,
the data string "sample",
a TITLE close tag,
and a HEAD close tag,
whereas the text:

<address>
<a HREF="#tim">Tim Berners-Lee</a>
</address>

will be reported as
an ADDRESS start tag,
the data string "\n"
an A start tag (with an HREF attribute and value),
the data string "Tim Berners-Lee",
the data string "\n"
an A close tag,
and an ADDRESS close tag.

[There's another content type called ANY, but it's just
like MIXED for our purposes.]

>0. Convert all new-lines inside of tags to spaces.

Newlines inside tags are the responsibility of the
SGML parser. I suggest you use the excellent sgmls
parser to test your rules by trial and error, or
consult the standard.

I have done both, and the results of my labors
are available in libHTML. I have also done an elisp
implementation, if anybody's interested.

The one tricky case is newlines inside attribute
value literals, e.g.

<foo bar="12
3">

This one is a little tricky. SGML section 7.9.3 says:

"An attribute value literal is interpreted as an attribute value by
replacing references within it, ignoring Ee and RS, and replacing RE
or SEPCHAR with SPACE."

The reference concrete syntax assigns the conventional unix newline
character, ASCII code 10, to the role of RS. So strictly speaking,
it should be ignored, and the value of the attribute is "123".

On the other hand, the sgmls parser does a little behind-the-scenes
magic on newlines. From the sgmls man page:

     An external entity resides in one or more files.  The entity
     manager component of sgmls maps a sequence of files into an
     entity in three sequential stages:

     1.   each carriage return character is turned into a non-
          SGML character;

     2.   each newline character is turned into a record end
          character, and at the same time a record start charac-
          ter is inserted at the beginning of each line;

     3.   the files are concatenated.

[This sort of thing _does_ still conform to the SGML standard.
You're allowed to do magic while assembling entities]

So using sgmls, the newline in this case would be treated as
RE, and converted to SPACE, i.e. ASCII character 32, by the
parser. So the value of the bar attribute is "12 3".

It's a question of how we construct SGML entities from HTML
data streams.


>1. For each tag NOT in
>     <PRE> </PRE> <A> </A> <PLAINTEXT>
>   remove ALL surrounding new-lines.

First, let's get one thing straight: the PLAINTEXT element as
described by the original HTML documentation is not representable
in SGML. For my purposes, I consider the HTML document to
end at the <PLAINTEXT> tag, and I consider the rest of the
data stream to be an RFC-822 message body or a MIME text/plain body,
and not SGML at all.

Next, let's keep in mind that you can't do things like the following
global substitition,
s/\n+(<(H1|H2|ADDRESS...))>/$2/g;
because it might find things that look like tags but aren't,
for example

<foo bar="
<H1>this is a little cooky, but nontheless legal and possible.">

But even if you're using a proper SGML parser, consider:

<H1>Here we go!
<a href="#xyz">click here</a>
There we went!
</H1>

The parser will return an H1 start tag, and then the
string "Here we go!\n". At this point, your rule doesn't
tell me what to do with the newline. I have to get
the next object before I decide.

Hmm... I guess that's reasonable. But I'd rather just pass all the
data charcters on the the text formatter and let it figure all this out.

Do we want to specify rules for the text formatter? If so, we need to
go beyond just newlines.  I see some data providers writing things
like:

<H1>Here are some things to consider:</H1>
<p>      thing one
<p>      thing two
<p>      thing three

The MidasWWW browser displays this as

Here are some things to consider:
thing one
thing two
thing three

which I think is reasonable. The provider should either use
<H1>Here are some things to consider</H1>
<UL>
<li>thing one
<li>thing two
<li>thing three
</ul>

or at a minimum,

<H1>Here are some things to consider</H1>
<PRE>
     thing one
     thing two
     thing three
</PRE>


>2. For each tag in
>     <PRE> <PLAINTEXT>

Why remove one new-line to the right? Just for HTML source file aesthetics?

There are also some new elements that act like A: EM, CODE, SAMP, etc.

We have not specified the rules for typesetting elements other
than XMP, LISTING, and PRE before now, so what you suggest is
as correct as anything else.

I think it's important that we agree on how to typeset the <PRE>
element. [And I think getting rid of the first newline after a <PRE>
tag is a Bad Thing.]

It's not important to me that we agree how to typeset other elements.
I'm inclined to give formatters great leeway with how they treat whitespace.
I wouldn't mind at all if something like

<H1>testing 123</H1>
foo       bar     blech		icky<a>wicky</a>


woo
<p>  abc defghi
jhkl sldjkf sld    	lsdjkf


were typeset as:

	TESTING		123

	foo bar blech ickywicky woo

	abc defghi jhkl sldjkf sld lsdjkf

My point is: don't use whitespace to represent significant
information except in the PRE elemnt. Use the tags that
are defined to have significance.

Turns out this is standard behavior. Boy is this a can of worms.

I just went back over the comp.text.sgml archives to research this
some more, and boy was I wrong.

From what I can tell, a newline is ignored by the SGML parser
if it's right after a start tag or right before an end tag.

For the whole story, see
gopher://ifi.uio.no:70/

SGML is a mess!

For what it is worth, the way the CERN implementations are supposed to work is:

	MIXED elements
	
Within a MIXED element,  newlines are treated as word breaks.  The effect of  
this is that if the imaginary output cursor has a non-white character to the  
left of it, then a space is introduced.  This means that any number of newlines  
will only produce one white space character.  [It involves a horrid "are we in  
the middle of a word?" flag.]

Spaces, however, always produce spaces, so multiple spaces will come out as  
multiple spaces.

	XMP
	
Within <XMP> I went all the way and said that from the trailing > of <XMP>
to the beginning <of </XMP> all data was litteral, including newlines.  
Therefore example sections typically are marked up as

<XMP>This is an example line

</XMP>
That was an example.  There are no new lines between the <XMP> and the example  
line because the XMP section causes a paragraph break, and the style for the  
normal paragraph specifies a minimum white space after each paragraph. Beacuse  
each XMP section is like a black box, any white spce inside it would not be  
seen by the white space management logic which overlaps the white spaces  
required around successive paragraphs, and extra white spce would result.

	PRE

By the way, I think we agreed (I gave in) that the <PRE> sections would have
siugnificant newlines.  Your manuals, Tom, have <p> as well as newlines, which  
gives double spacing on my browsers.  So I tread newlines as newlines in all
the <PRE> element just as XMP.

	SGML generation
	
Off the top of my head I think what happened was in Mixed elements, I generate  
the newlines instead of spaces in PCDATA when the line gets a bit long, and  
also insert them before open tags like <H3> which cause paragraph breaks  
anyway.  As an anchor tag need not cause a word break even, I do NOT insert  
them before an <A>, but rather always output "<A\nNAME=%s" so that the
HREF attribute (generally the line length buster) starts atthe beginning of  a  
line.

Mailer: Elm [revision: 66.25]

I am getting really excited about the possibilities for the Web for a variety
of roles. Much us this however depends on getting the right features into
HTTP2. I would very much like comments on the following suggestions.

Authentication
--------------

I think that every HTTP2 request (not just GET) should include the "From"
field, and that it is strongly desirable to include the user's full name,
e.g.

    From: dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com (David Raggett)

The user's name must be easy to extract regardless of the particular variant
of email addressing scheme.

For some services the server may need to check if the user is authorised for
this service. In many cases the Internet (numeric) address and the information
in the "From:" field will suffice.

Additional security will require a password. I think this should be a header
in its own right. The "POST" command names a document that you wish to post a
response to. That document may not be owned by you so it doesn't seem right to
muddle up the authorisation for the POST command with that documents Udi.

so lets have a new header  "Password:  xyzzy"

A further trick would be to encrypt your password for this server/service
together with the time of day using a scheme agreed by you and the server. The
server then decrypts the value sent with the Password header to extract the
password, and time of day and checks that the time is correct  to within a
margin for network delays.

This only effects the HTTP2 protocol in requiring different error codes to
distinguish the cases:

    a)  your Internet address is not permissible for this service
    b)  your user name is not permissible for this service
    c)  your password is incorrect
    d)  your password is ok, but the time check failed


Basic need for administrators identify and even to mail users.
Frequent need for authentication - not just on GET
encrypt password + time of day to foil copying password

Needless to say the value for the Password header should be composed of
printable 7 bit ascii characters, excluding white space and control chars.


Caching
-------

It will be desirable to avoid overloading servers with popular documents by
supporting a caching scheme at local servers (or even at browsers?). This
implies that document headers should provide sufficient information to make
this practical.

Servers need to be able to work out what documents to trash from their caches.
A simple approach is to compare the date the document was received with the
date it was originally created or last modified. Say it works out that when
you got the document it was already one week old. Then one rough rule of thumb
is to trash it after another week. You can be rather smarter if there is a
valid expiry date included with the document:

    o   the document header should *always* include a "Date:" field giving
        the date it was last written to

    o   the "Expires:" field is optional

    o   the date values should be in a prescribed format to simplify
        machine interpretation (Is this adequately defined by existing RFCs?)

I think that we need to provide an operation in which the server returns a
document only if it is later that a date/time supplied with  the request. If
it is the same (or earlier) the server should return a suitable status code
and an optional "Cost:" header, see below.

This is already provided for:

    GET udi
    SINCE datatime

The meaning of SINCE needs to change as in Tim's original description of HTTP
it means "greater than or equals", whereas I want strictly "greater than".

Note that servers shouln't cache documents with restricted readership since
each server don't know the restrictions to apply. This requires a further
header to identify such documents as being unsuitable for general caching:

    Distribution: restricted | unrestricted

This header is only needed for documents with restricted readership.
An dirty alternative would be to set the expiry date to the same value as
supplied with the "Date:" header.

Copyright & Payments
--------------------

Although the Internet backbone restricts profit making services, many subnets,
such as University campuses, and company subnets such as HP's have no such
problem. Indeed users strongly want access to copyrighted information for
which a payment is due.

My suggestion is that servers are responsible for tracking who accesses what
information, and hence how much they owe. For use within Hewlett Packard for
library services, we anticipate including some extra headers in the request:

    EmployeeNumber: 148689
    LocationCode:   8126        (an account number for cross charging)

This would be stripped off when sending requests to servers outside the HP
subnet. These headers are ignored by servers which conform to strict HTPP2.

I would like the document header to include an optional cost header, e.g.

    Cost: 4.05 US DOLLARS
    Copyright: Reuters Inc.

This would let the users know how much a given document has cost them, as well
as who owns the copyright. The latter heading is needed since you can't always
put it in the document, e.g. think of photographic images.


The "Cost: 4.03 US DOLLARS" field


Copyright and Caching
---------------------

What happens if a copyright protected document is saved in the cache of a
local server? We have got to ensure that the rightful owners get paid for
access even when the document is obtained from a local server's cache.

My idea is that for each access, this server should inform the server on which
the original document resides. This notification can however be deferred to
a time when the network is quiet ...

The notification proceeds using the "GOT" command

    GOT udi
    From: dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com (David Raggett)
    Server: hplose.hpl.hp.com
    EmployeeNumber: 148689          /* HP specific */
    LocationCode:   8126            /* HP specific */

The From header gives the name of the user who requested the document. The
Server header names the machine with the cache, and other company specific
fields are used for accounting purposes.

Note that this scheme can't be used for documents with restricted readership,
since the server looking after the cache doesn't know who is and who isn't
allowed to read this document.

The protocol ought to allow for multiple GOT statements (and associated
headers in the same message. For this it seems simple enough to require a
terminating blank line.


Naming Parts of a Multipart body
--------------------------------

It would be nice to use the MIME format's capability to send multiple
documents as part of the same message, e.g. an HTML doc with several
pictures. To make this work each separate part needs to include the
Document Udi in its header, so that the browser can check if it has the
document in its local cache (history stack) or whether it needs to make
network request for the picture etc.

    DocumentName: Udi


Effective support for discussion groups
---------------------------------------

My model is that discussion groups each have unique Udi's. Each discussion
group has a sequence of base notes, and each base note is associated with a
sequence of responses. I am unsure of how to deal with cross postings!

Over a period of time the number of base notes can grow arbitrarily, and we
need a way of listing all those within a given time period. This can be
supported using Tim's BEFORE and SINCE modifiers in association with the GET
command. The server is responsible for creating an HTML document corresponding
to the list of base notes (and how many responses there are for each etc.).

In retrieving a base note, you should get an indication of how many responses
there are using the header:

    Responses:  16

You also need a way of retrieving a given response. One way is to ask for the
list of Udi's for all the responses, another is a command to get a particular
response given the Udi for the base note and a sequence number, e.g.

    RESPONSES Udi           /* request the list of response's as an html doc */
    GETRESPONSE 12 Udi      /* get a given response (12th in the list) */


What do people think?


I assume the POST command can be accompanied by an html doc as a body.

Looking forward to your comments,

David Raggett

I agree that this compilicates it.  The explanation is in large part in
files which are likely to be unreadable by many browers!  I would
like to see the whole of the content in "proper" HTML. The most useful way
to put in examples is to make littlefiles Example_nn.html and put soft
links in Example_nn.txt too the same file. This allows people to look simply at  
the source of the example with a browser, and also to try their browser out on  
it as a hypertext document.

We would then generate a paper document out of all the hypertext and the .txt
files, and the document generator won't fall over!

I would also like to see a node on each tag.  I found from user comments that  
the current explanations of HTML or just not good enough. We need some stuff on  
the side of the spec explaining what each tag is actually FOR, with an example  
of each, acessesed from a reference section.  Maybe that can wiat till after  
IANA registration, though.

It sounds as though (1) HTML.c should be turned into a structued hypertext
object built on top of -- in the line mode case only -- the HText.c object.

I feel that the SGML parsing object should create the textobject, because
one SGML file could cause many displayable objects to be created -- in the  
future at least.  Theerfore, it is not enough to pass the SGML object the ID
of an already-created text object. Does that make sense?

Otherwise I think our architecures are converging ... do you want to make
a new WWW/Library and I'll try it out?  I can release it in parallel with
the current one for a while for safety.

HEAD/BODY elements are in all new text, but not numeric character refs.

I would like to see an 8-bit basic character set as I said in some other

I would have thought the SGML engine ought to be able to resolve all entities.
The communication between it and the text object would have to be defined in  
terms of a particular character set, and perhaps if there is more than one  
contender the SGML engine could have a compilation option.

That isthe easiest to implement.  It makes the implementation outside SGML the  
least SGML-aware.

The passord certainly shouldn't be in the udi.

The hairy part is that we must be flexible about privacy shemes here.
We may meet one lot committed to kerberos and another group comitted to  
something else. So we should allow perhaps for a generic 'Authorization:' field
and a number of rather extensive "refused" condidtions including the ones you  
suggest and specifying the sort of authorization required.

rather than put passwords in the clear all the time (a reasonable low level
scheme) the next setp is for the server to send back, along with the refusal, a
random string to be encripted by the user using his key. This prevents anyone
from breaking it unless they can put together the two messages, which is
an extra hurdle.  The random string is related to the IP address the guy  
originally used and will also time out, of course.

We should look at Privacy Enhanced Mail -- the requiremenst must be similar.  
All these schemes eventually rely on an established net of trusted servers  
which doesn't exist right now, so we are putting in hooks for the future.

          As well as caching, replication would be nice. But this is
      only practical if resource identifiers do not contain location
      information (otherwise replication is only possible by making
      all the peer servers to appear to be one machine, as in the
      DNS CNAME suggestion I made some time ago).
          But if resource identifiers do not contain host information
      then you need an external means of determining how to reach
      the resource. This is analagous to routing protocols (an address
      is not a route ...)
          Such a system is probably over ambitious for now. Anyway,
      back to caching ...

          I think this is silly. I haven't changed a document for
      six months, therefore it is safe to say that it won't be
      changed for the next six months ...
          This also depends on hosts agreeing on the date. To quote
      RFC1128, talking about a 1988 survey of the time/date on
      Internet hosts, "... a few had errors as much as two years"

> I think that we need to provide an operation in which the server returns a

          This would be useful as part of a replication system,
       as long as both ends exchanged timestamps initially so
       that the dates can be synchronised.

         It may be stating the obvious, but once you allow a
    user to access you data such that they can save it, there is
    no technical way you can prevent them from publically
    redistributing your data. This is a social/legal problem,
    not a technical one.
         Accepting that nothing can be done to stop deliberate
    abuse of licensed information, there is a need to prevent
    accidental abuse. Probably the simplest way to do this is
    to mark the document as one which should NOT be cached.
          
         Perhaps this leading towards a very simple minded
    caching scheme a la DNS, where information is returned
    together with an indication of its "time to live" (TTL),
    ie how long this can reasonably be cached. Setting a default
    TTL for a server gives an idea of the "volatility" of the
    information contained therein 
         Unless a document is exported with world read access,
    it should always have TTL of 0.

These are comment son the second part of Dave's note.
They refer to the new HTTP spec and a hypertextversion of RFC850  which I made
in order to be able to cross-reference to it (and make it prettier).

Like "Expires:" for example. See
http://info.cern.chhypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html

...>  

>      o   the document header should *always* include a "Date:" field giving

Agreed.  Now why in the spec did I say that Date: was the creation date?
In any event, we need last-modified as well as created dates. I chose
to use the existing Date: field of RFC 850 as the creation date.
I guess the modified date is more available, but if you are tracing things
the creation date is a better thing to file under.  For a mail/news article
of course they are the same.

>      o   the "Expires:" field is optional

agreed.

agreed. yes it is, in RFC850: in 

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/rfc850/rfc850.html#z10
  

  (pretty soon we're going to HAVE to have hypertext mail!).

Need to look at NNTP here.  We end up getting very close indeed to it.
I would want the functionalty of this search to map onto the NEWNEWS
very nicely.  A newsgroup is just a hypertext list anyway.

Good point.  Not the the distribution of other messages is in the form of
To: and Cc: and Newsgroup: and in fact Distribution:.  (See  
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/rfc850/rfc850.html#z12)
So you'll need a new fieldname.  If we could only merge the functionality of  
these systems in some cool way, it would be grand.

When looking at protection for more than just GET, I came up with the
	Public: *<method>
	Allow: *<method>
lines documented in the list of object headers I mentioned above.

>  This header is only needed for documents with restricted readership.

Yes but that would not be legally binding.  It could also mean "this document  
is a live status: fetch it as often as you can".

I note here that both the copyright holder and the account for charging are  
items in some address space, and we ought to be as flexible with these address  
spaces as wit the udi.  So I would propose something like

	ChargeTo:  HPInternal:/8126/148689  upto $2.00
	
would be better.  But how does this fit in with authentication?  Once you are
authenticated, your prefered method of paying will be known.  You can't have
charging without authentication!

There is a little problem with sending an "upto $2.00" field as it requires  
honesty of the server not to just charge you $2.00 flat!  This is a real  
problem, as otherwise one needs twice the round trip delays, which we really  
object to, if one prefers the fairer

	C	GET  junk
	S	No way: you pay $2.00 first
	C	GET junk I promise to pay $2.00
	S	*junk

Hey, that;s not something you do for one method, it's a change to the whole  
protocol to introduce pipelining.

A simple thing in the first instance is to say that it illegal to cache
a for-pay document unless you have a privat earrangement with the owner
about refunding him.  This could be done using a completely separate billing  
process.

I agree that the POST method is well defined as a method of the
newsgroup class which takes an article as a parameter. In fact, as you say,
cross-posting makes a mess of this, as it involved many groups in one atomic  
operation.  This is a peculiarity of news which makes it difficult to map onto

I haven't been following the discussion closely enough to know
if a suggestion for dealing with the problem will be helpful,
but...

I use the SHORTREF feature to implicitly recognize an EMPTY
<newline> tag wherever I want newlines after a start tag or
right before an end tag to be preserved.  The parser will
generate the implicit tags which my processing engine then
converts back to actual newlines for output display.

Although this seems like a pain I believe the behavior of
the parser is logically correct and the only way to be consistent.

I don't think this flag is "horrid." It's a pretty normal text-formatting
thing to do.

Is anyone distressed by the situation where some browsers compress
multiple spaces [in typeset paragraphs] into one, and some do not? I'm not.
I'd say "Don't do that" to the fool who put multiple spaces in
his source.

Unfortunately, this conflicts with the SGML standard. An SGML parser
will report
<XMP>
foo
</XMP>

as
an XMP start tag
the string "foo" [NOT "\nfoo\n"]
an XMP end tag

And so it is, strictly speaking, illegal to treat the above markup
differently from
<XMP>foo</XMP>

I'm not sure how we should resolve this.

This is a situation we need to resolve, one way or another. I'm inclined
to decide that <p> elements are allowed in PRE elements, but they have
no significance. They were put there to cause the old linemode browser
to break the line, so they have always been redundant. So Tim's treatment
of newlines in PRE is correct, but his treatment of <P> there is not

Your argument is sound, but we're trying to design a format
that is defined completely in terms of SGML, but parsed by
homebrew code.

So the SGML declaration for HTML turns the SHORTTAG feature
off, saving us some parsing hassles.

If you're using a full-featured SGML parser, you can usually
tweak the DTD to make the stuff parse how you like through
shortrefs and the like. But we're using a bare-bones
SGML parser, so we're just trying to get by without
conflicting with the standard.

Unfortunately, the most recent version of the spec is the hardest to
find. I'd like most of the pointers to the older versions to be
updated. And I'd like to see the instructions to data providers
brought up to date. Currently, most of the documentation (especially
the exmples) doesn't say to quote HREFs, for example.

The "explanation" is nothing more than an implementors guide. I
thought that implementors would get more from example HTML code
than any prose I could come up with in a reasonable amount of
time. I agree that much is needed in the way of real documentation.

My point exactly: for the IANA, all we need is a correct spec,
not necessarily an easy to use spec. That's what I meant
by "workable."

I don't have time to do a good job explaining how to use HTML.
I just wanted to explore all the technical issues and clear
them up.

This question seems to confuse two things: the ISOlat1 entity
set, and the ISO Latin 1 character set. The first is mapping
of names to glyphs, and the second is a mapping from the numbers
128-255 to glyphs. I think they're in alphabetical order
by name, but not in order by the ISO Latin 1 character set.

>I would have thought the SGML engine ought to be able to resolve all entities.

The SGML parser is responsible for resolving text entities. There
are also external data entites, which are ultimately resolved by
the application. I was leaning towards treating ISO latin characters
as external data entities, rather than text entities. If we treat
ISOlatin characters as SGML characters, we eliminate the need for entity
references in HTML altogether (we could still support &ouml, &lt etc.
however)

Here is the crux of the matter:

>The communication between it and the text object would have to be defined in  
>terms of a particular character set

And this character set is stated in the SGML declaration at
the top of html.dtd.

If we define HTML in terms of the
full ISO Latin 1 character set, then the parser can deal with
&ouml, and pass it to the text object as a data character, just
like an 'A' character. For X displays using iso8559 fonts, that's
cool.

But on a PC or a Mac, that means the text object will have to
scan all the data it gets and convert the Latin1 encoding to
it's own. Yuck.

>... and perhaps if there is more than one  
>contender the SGML engine could have a compilation option.

Hmmm... One might argue that as long as we support conversion inside
the SGML parser for EBCDIC machines, we might as well support PC and
Mac character sets while we're at it.

My original plan was that the core of wwwlib would support
ASCII only, and application developers would deal with latin
characters by name. Moving Latin-1 characters into the core
complicates it somewhat, and I'm still against that.

I'm at home with the flu, without my copy of ISO 8879 and I
haven't become one who can quote clause and sub-clause from
memory (yet :-)), but ...

SHORTTAG is an optional feature, but SHORTREF is not, since
it is required in the SGML declaration.  I think, according
to the standard, a system which does not support SHORTREF
is not compliant and therefore not even minimum SGML.

My solution only requires SHORTREF.  I code:

<!ELEMENT	newline	- o		EMPTY>
<!ENTITY	nltag	STARTTAG	"newline">
<!SHORTREF	nlmap	"&#RS;"		nltag>
<!USEMAP	nlmap			(verbatim)>

The use of OMITTAG in the newline element is not
necessary.  This code causes the parser to recognize
record starts as newline tas within verbatim tags.
My processor converts the newline tags back to record
starts.

But most browsers seem to have cacheing anyway, which means they can do
global search/replace.  But you can still do it more or less sequentially.
Just buffer strings of new-lines until you know what follows them, and
then deal with it.  There's no method you can propose which is correct
and doesn't involve storing something somewhere.

This is another alternative I considered.  But I figured that I have to
deal with various parsing things when I read the HTML anyway.  I was
just going to take each chunk of data, (with anchors pre-processed out)
and remove all whitespace at the beginning and end (except for PRE sections
and such).  But if someone put in whitespace, why should I muck with it?
Who knows, they might have even wanted it there.

I hadn't meant otherwise.  But you have to read it in anyway, and since
my method deals with things prior to any other parsing, you treat it
all as one clump.

I suppose I agree with this more or less, at least from the point of view
of generating my own code.  But we have to make something clear - can
a browser keep all the whitespace if it wants to?  Or in other words,
can an html generator assume collapsing whitespace, or just be aware
that it might happen?

This was almost the exact example I was playing with when I decided to start
this messy discussion.  Also some paragraph examples.  Both of the following
should mean the same:

some text<P>more text

and

some text
<P>
more text

The latter being commonly used.  I realized that unless you could remove
surround new-lines in cases like this, the second paragraph would start
with a space.  Similarly, you might find headings, or other things with
a space at the beginning.

Note that the method I proposed has the advantage of automatically dealing
with this (sort of).  If the document was converted simply by adding a <P>
to the end of each line, then for such lines, I remove the newline but keep
the <P>.  Then the code that deals with PRE sections can happily honor
both new-lines and <P> tags, thus making it compatible with either style.

Hmm... I've got the standard in my lap, and while it usually
takes me at least 1/2hour to be sure I've reall all the
relavent sections, it appears to agree with your statement.

However, we're only interested in parsing instances of
a particluar DTD.

If we make no SHORTREF declarations in this DTD, we can
dispense with shortref processing in our parser.

Hmmm... this is interesting. First a question: why
the newline element in the first place? why not just
make the shortref expand to a newline character in
the first place?

If we put declarations like this in the HTML DTD, it
would then be legal to treat

<XMP>
foo
</XMP>

different from <XMP>foo</XMP>

Thanks for the idea... it just might work!

You've already decided to buy-in on SGML.  You must,
correctly, I think, see the immediate and long-term
advantages in adhering to the international standard.
"Conforming", the minimum set of features, is a
non-arbitrary baseline which you can expect all
html-capable parsers to meet.

One should be able to get a PhD for a good
SHORTREF dissertation.  I think I've gotten the gist
of some of the discussion though - SHORTREF must be
supported in the SGML declaration in order to deal with
some problems which arise through the handling of 
some special codes on some systems.  For example, &#RS;
&#RE; equivalent to &#RS on UNIX systems

It is quite possible that making your parser conforming
will save your neck someday.

>Hmmm... this is interesting. First a question: why
>the newline element in the first place? why not just
>make the shortref expand to a newline character in

I don't think you could do that, since SHORTREF is an
implicit tagging scheme.  Even if you could it wouldn't
help since it would leave the ESIS structure unchanged,
with the same filtering of newlines as content is passed
to the process.  My scheme changes the ESIS before content
is passed to the process.

I agree, but it is important to keep an eye of where things are going.
The ability to replicate documents in this way will depend on name servers
e.g. X.500. In the meantime is this necessary? At first, a simple scheme is
to send all remote requests via a fast local server. This server checks if
this Udi is in its cache, and if not forwards the request to the machine
named in the Udi itself. You can extend this to take advantage of several
caches, and the work done by ANSA (Advanced Networked Systems Architecture)
on trading may be apropriate.

... talking about when to purge the cache

> I think this is silly. I haven't changed a document for six months,
> therefore it is safe to say that it won't be changed for the next six
> months ...

Yes, perhaps not one of my best ideas! I think we need some position in
between caching docs only for several minutes, and the full replication
mechanism used with network news and nntp.

One approach is for the server to periodically refresh cache contents. (This
is what Lotus Notes does). You set it up to refresh docs at night, or perhaps
on a trickle basis in the background. The problem is knowing what the
appropriate interval is for each document. The "Expiry:" field or an
equivalent "KeepFor:" (time to live) field when present gives an explicit
suggestion. My "silly" suggestion was a rule of thumb aimed at allowing the
sever to "learn" that some docs don't change much, and so can be refreshed at
longer intervals.

Another complimentary approach is to provide a machanism whereby a server
owning a document informs a list of client servers when it determines that a
given document has changed. This is critical for a successful room booking
application. For this to work, the protocol needs to include the requests:

    NOTIFY hplose.hpl.hp.com:8001
    ADD Udi
    RETRY   1000 10

This is used to inform a server (named in the Udi) that another server
(IP address: hplose.hpl.hp.com, port 8001) wishes to be informed when this
document is changed or deleted. The RETRY parameter is optional and used to
determine the notification retry interval in seconds, followed by how many
times to try.

    NOTIFY hplose.hpl.hp.com:8001
    REMOVE Udi

The reverse operation removing a server from a notification list

    CHANGED Udi
    <Doc header>
    <Doc body>

The message sent to servers on the notification list when the specified doc
has changed. If the doc has been deleted then the body should be empty.

In the case where it is currently impossible to establish a connection with a
server on the notification list, the notification should be periodically
retried until a suitable timeout period has expired. See earlier RETRY field.

You don't need to complicate the http server loop to implement this
mechanism as notifications can be handled by a separate program.

... talking about problems with comparing date/time info

> This also depends on hosts agreeing on the date. To quote
> RFC1128, talking about a 1988 survey of the time/date on

Wow! I had no idea that this was the case. I had hoped that all machines
would have support for date/time conversion for all known time zones, so
that by including the time zone as part of the format, there would be no
problem.

In this case we need to define how servers should process date/time info,
particularly when a mismatch is detected.

... talking about copyright protection

There is no *techical way* to stop me driving my car at a passerby and
killing him! The answer is that it is illegal to breach the copyright law.
In HP we have notices next to each photocopier, reminding us of what the law
allows us to do. The same will apply to networked access. Publishers are
concerned that they receive fair payment for their information, and the
critical issue is to ensure that all processes can pass an audit to show
their compliance.

My idea is that its ok to cache copyrighted docs so long as you put in an
effective mechanism for logging and handling payments. This mechanism must be
able to pass a suitable audit procedure. I believe that the scheme I described
would do this.

> Probably the simplest way to do this is to mark the
> document as one which should NOT be cached.

You need to separate the issue of copyright protection from ensuring secure
access to restricted information. I proposed the "Distribution:" header for
this purpose.

Many thanks for your comments,

Best wishes,

Dan,


[I will limit the lines to 72 instead of 80, -- sorry!]

I have changed the links which I could find to point to the new DTD  
and the new spec.  There is a soft link "Current" so that one can  
link to the latest version but still allow reference and access to  
previous dated versions. See  
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Connolly/History.html

I have also edited the general description of HTML to bring it  
further into line with the DTD, I hope.  I have reorganised it so  
that there is more scope for adding detailed guidance and more  
examples.

I have put in a WIDTH attribute on PRE.  I have put in LINK.
Could we have both in the DTD next time?

I could do with references for the origins of the character  
highlighting elements, so as to pick up descriptions of them.  I have  
just guessed in  
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Highlighting.html.

That would complicate certainly the CERN browsers, in that if they see a <p>

context-sensitive about these things -- they just do the right thing with
good HTML and don't bomb out with bad html.

I'd prefer us to say that the effect of <P> within <PRE> is undefined, or that  
it is not recommened but if used is a newline.  I'd like Thomas to take them  
out of his man pages, but butil then it isn't a disaster, its just double

<PRE>  ... it would look weird to historians.

I am prepared to change the <XMP> behaviour to be standard SGML for the sake of

These are comments on Tim's responses to my recent message on HTTP2.

>>       machine interpretation (Is this adequately defined by existing RFCs?)

> agreed. yes it is, in RFC850

RFC977 provides a tighter definition for date/time restricting it to the time
zone of the server or GMT. I would like us to restrict it to GMT period - as
otherwise how can you in general find out the time zone of the server?

    NEWGROUPS date time [GMT] [<distribution>]

    The date is sent as 6 digits in the format YYMMDD, where YY is the last
    two digits of the year, MM is the two digits of the month, (with leading
    zero, if appropriate), and DD is the day of the month (with leading zero,
    if appropriate). The closest century is assumed as part of the year, i.e.
    86 specifies 1986, 30 specifies 2030, 99 is 1999, 00 is 2000).

    Time must also be specified. It must be as 6 digits HHMMSS with HH being
    hours in the 24-hour clock, MM minutes 00-59, and SS seconds 00-59.
    The time is assumed to be in the server's time zone unless the token "GMT"
    appears, in which case both time and date are evaluated at the 0 meridian.
    
RFC850 mentions that not all time zones have well known abbreviations,
making it difficult to carry out date/time arithmetic. Furthermore, Kevin
Hoadley's comment:

          This also depends on hosts agreeing on the date. To quote
      RFC1128, talking about a 1988 survey of the time/date on
      Internet hosts, "... a few had errors as much as two years"

suggests we will have problems with servers in this regard.
One solution would be for the server to send a field with each document:

        KeepFor: nnnn seconds | mmm days

The cache management software then notes the date/time received and works
out for itself the expiry date/time. This method has the great advantage of
avoiding all need for date/time conversion, and any reliance on the server's
having their clocks setup correctly.

I like the NEWNEWS command, but feel we should keep the GET & SINCE command.
The latter allow you to refresh a cached document with one exchange whereas
you need two when using NEWNEWS and a subsequent GET.

The NEWNEWS command is intended for finding new basenotes and responses,
and should be contrasted with the NEWGROUPS command.

I don't understand the description of "Distribution: nj.all" in RFC850
(section 2.2.8). It is unclear what its argument is. Is it a geographical
hierarchy or is it some kind of newsgroup name with the "all" wildcard?

It would be nice in some circumstances to define the readership groups for
situations where a server could apply group membership information to restrict
readership. This field would be supplied by the author. This idea is I believe
in the same spirit as RFC850. Consider the following example:

    Distribution: incl.kbpd psl.all

This says that the document can be given to anyone in psl and anyone in the
kbpd subgroup of incl. You can make these names correspond to your
organisation. The maintenance of these readership groups is outside the scope
of the HTTP2 protocol. Local servers shouldn't cache documents including this
header unless they "understand" the specified readership groups and can apply
the same membership tests. This involves sharing the same definitions across a
group of servers, for instance within a campus or a company.

>> I would like the document header to include an optional cost header, e.g.
>>

Four points:

First, it certainly isn't the case that once you are authenticated
then the way of charging you is known. For example consider members of
the public wishing to pay for information using a credit card number for a
service they have never before accessed. In HP it may in some cases be
sufficient to check that the client's internet address starts with the
company's subnet code. However, the server still needs the employee
name, number and location code to cross charge.

Second, I don't think the "upto" concept is needed. In the vast majority of
cases a fixed cost will suffice. A point to watch when keeping documents in
local caches, is that this cost may change from time to time. This
corresponds to pricing of normal goods, and I believe can be adequately
handled by appropriately setting the "KeepFor" or "Expires" field.

Third, for legal purposes it is still necesary to tag documents with who owns
the copyright, as in books, music and other products. For this reason we
should include the "Copyright:".

Fourth, I like the idea of a universal scheme for naming the copyright owner
and charging method, but feel that this will take some time to take effect.
For the moment I would like to stick to the following:

    Cost: 4.05 US DOLLARS
    Copyright: 1988 Time International Inc.
    ChargeTo: HP/8126/148689

Where the meaning of the "CopyRight:" and "ChargeTo:" fields is outside the
scope of the HTTP2 protocol specification. The "Cost:" field always starts
with the amount and should be followed by the currency name.

The requesting GET could include an optional header:

    CostingUpTo:  2.50 US DOLLARS

This would result in the server returning an error message if this was less
than the cost of the requested document, and introduces issues of how
to recognising currency type and performing currency conversion. Users should
be able to see how much they will have to pay on preceding hypertext pages
(as supplied by the server).

No. You can only get copies of documents for which the server recognises that
there is an effective arrangement for making the payment. However, if this is
the case, then caching presents no problems, provided the authetication and
ChargeTo information is preserved and supplied to the server with the GOT
command.

I will try and lay my hands on a copy of "Litterary Machines".

Oh dear! It seems a waste to have to set up a connection for each such
request. Perhaps the safest thing is to allow multiple Udi's with the GOT
command, all of which must be for the same client. What limits are there on
line length for headers or is there a mechanism for continuing arguments on
subsequent lines? This would still be effective in limiting network traffic,
and processing time.

The NNTP protocol employs the POST command to post an article, and relies
on the document's header to specify the news groups for posting to with the
Newsgroups header. The "References:" header is used to link a response to any
articles prompting submission of this article.

Thus each article can be posted to multiple groups, and can have zero or more
references to preceding articles. For convergence between NNTP and HTTP2 we
need to clarify the mapping of groups and references.

News groups as currently defined are hierarchical name spaces without
reference to a server or filing system. The WWW model currently ties
documents to both of these. I would like to be able to post responses as
WWW documents which refer to one (or more?) existing documents. We can already
do this. What we can't do is to find what documents reference a given
document. This is hard in principle and practice since the various documents
can be on different machines scattered over the entire world.

The answer is to provide a mechanism which allows servers to track which Udi's
should be recorded as being "responses" to other Udi's.

What is the analogous concept to news group?

These are lists of articles, and not articles as such. The GROUP command in
NNTP allows you to identify articles in given groups. The LIST command returns
the complete list of groups known to the server, while the NEWGROUPS command
returns groups created since a specified date/time, and matching on specified
distribution categories.

I think that in WWW we should treat groups as named documents which are
generated by the server from the database of postings stored under that name.
The important thing is to distinguish between the Udi's of references and
those of news groups.

Given these ideas I will now present my suggestions for the POST command:

The document header supplied with the POST command has the following fields:

    Newsgroups:  <followed by one or more Udi's>        /* optional */
    References:  <followed by one or more Udi's>        /* optional */

Followed by one of the following:

    DocumentName: Udi       /* for an existing document - body is void */
    NewDocument:            /* for new document, contents follow as body */

The semantics are the same as for NNTP, except that the Newsgroups header is
optional. In otherwords you can post responses to any WWW document - it
doesn't need to be in a news group. The server should return the Udi of the
document if successful (note that the NNTP POST command doesn't bother with
this).

We can include support for ARTICLE, BODY, HEAD, LIST and NEWGROUPS commands in
a way very similar to NNTP. The GROUP command in NNTP returns the first and
last article number in the group. This is unlikely to be what we want - as it
depends of the special naming scheme used for network news articles. We are
probably more interested in getting a list of article names in the group. In
my earlier message I suggested that this could best be achieved using the GET
command in conjunction with SINCE and BEFORE parameters (to allow for really
humungous groups with thousands of base notes). The server is responsible for
interpreting this command with the appropriate database query.

A really useful command missing from NNTP is the ability to list the responses
to a given document, i.e. the command names a given document/article, and is
returned with the list of Udi's for documents which were posted with that
article as part of their references. It would be great if this list was sent
by the server along with the base document, as a separate part in a multipart
message.

Finally, I want to draw attention to post-it style annotations. It would be
really nice to be able to post a note at a particular point within a given
document. The browser would show such annotations as little post-it symbols
which you click to see their contents. This requires similar mechanisms to
that for discussion groups. Perhaps we could have an ANNOTATE command:

    ANNOTATE   Udi  /* including an anchor for positioning the annotation */

   (body follows)

Authors place anchors in documents to suit their own needs and not the
unforeseen needs of others. It is therefore necessary to general the anchor
syntax in document Udi's to support a more flexible scheme based on pattern
matching. Servers should send the document along with the list of annotations.

Comments please.

Best wishes and sorry for such a long response,

Dave Raggett

Ok... we're getting close to a workable document here. I have
some suggestions for the organization.

The "Hypertext Markup Language" document I wrote was supposed
to replace the root of the HTML documentation. I suggest we
merge them. I'll work on it and let you know what I come
up with.

The WIDTH attribute is there. I'll add LINK.

From (texinfo)Specifying in the GNU info hierarchy:

`@code'
     Indicates text that is a literal example of a piece of a program.

`@samp'
     Indicates text that is a literal example of a sequence of
     characters.

`@kbd'
     Indicates the names of keys on the keyboard or characters you
     type.

`@key'
     Used for the conventional name for a key on a keyboard.

`@var'
     Indicates a metasyntactic variable.

`@dfn'
     Indicates the introductory or defining use of a term.

`@cite'
     Indicates the name of a book.

[I left @file out of HTML -- can't remember why.]

From Emph and Strong:

`@emph' and `@strong' are two forms of emphasis.  `@strong' is
stronger.

From Fonts:

@i,  @b and @t
--------------

These three commands specify font changes in the printed manual and
have no effect in the Info file.  `@i' requests italic font (in some
versions of TeX, a slanted font is used), `@b' requests bold face,
and `@t' requests the fixed-width font used by `@kbd'.  All three
commands apply to an argument that follows, surrounded by braces.

If possible, you should avoid using these three commands.  If you
find a need to use one, it probably indicates a lack in the Texinfo
language.

Subject: strategy for HTML spec?
Date: Mon, 11 Jan 93 19:18:56 CST
From: Dan Connolly <connolly@pixel.convex.com>


Save for newline handling and Latin 1 characters, I feel
that most of the technical issues in the HTML spec have
been ironed out.

But the documentation in the web is far from up to date.
My spec isn't sufficient to replace the HTML stuff in the
web, so it gets tacked on through links. Meanwhile, many
of the examples and explanations are in conflict with the DTD.

And we're not getting any closer to a hardcopy or plain text
version of the spec.

I started editing Tim's latest work on the HTML spec, but
it's not clear how my edits will get into the web. I don't
want them just tacked on: they're corrections to stuff that's
not right! But without groupware support, it's slow going.
Hmm... we need a better strategy.

[begin bitching and moaning...]

Also, I am frustrated that noone else seems willing to look
closely at SGML at all. The SGMLs parser makes it easy to
try stuff out, and comp.text.sgml is a great place to learn
a lot of stuff, but none of the other implementors have
bothered to try them out.

For example, Tim asked if I could put LINK into the DTD.
I wasn't familiar with the motivation for the element at
the time, and I'm still not sure how it works exactly:
how many of them are allowed, for example?

If he would take the time to construct a couple example
documents using LINK (and make the necessary modifications
to the DTD), I'm sure things would be much clearer.

Another example: the newlines issue. It's easy to edit
a couple example files, run them through sgmls, and see
where the parser eats newlines and where it reports them
to the application.

And none of the data providers has grabbed SGMLs to check
their output, as far as I can tell.

I have put a lot of my free time into investigating HTML
and its relationship to SGML, and I have done my best
to report my findings, but I'm getting frustrated by
the lack of initiative from anyone else. Other folks
are willing to hack out implementations, but they're
not willing to check them against the SGML standard,
it seems. If nobody else is serious about SGML conformance,
I will find other ways to spend my free time. But I
think SGML conformance is critical to the the quality
of the WWW project.

Rest assured, others (well, me, at least :) are fiddling with SGML. Bear in
mind, however, that my knowledge of it is still really, really rudimentary.

Its a fairly overwhelming (at least on initial exposure) concept.

The stuff you've done is definately appreciated. You've managed to get HTML
to a much more formally described language than it was before, and also to
the point where it isnt changing from one week to another (which was a real
bummer).

Subject: HTML todo list
Date: Mon, 11 Jan 93 22:36:43 CST
From: Dan Connolly <connolly@pixel.convex.com>

Please excuse the bitching and moaning from the last message.
My motto is "Accept the situation or do something about it."
Kind of a condensed version of the serenity prayer.

Since I don't have resources to fix the whole HTML situation,
here's a laundry list of everything I can think of about
HTML. Perhaps discussions and code fixes can refer
to "#15 in the HTML todo list" for example.


In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Technical.html

1. My dictionary lists "markup" as a word, not mark-up.
  HTML format[4]          A description of the mark-up language used for some
                         documents and for search hit-lists.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Bugs.html
2. The PLAINTEXT situation should be logged as a bug against
the server. PLAINTEXT is deprecated.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/FAQ/List.html
4. HTML should support QUESTION and RESPONSE elements to
support converting USENET FAQ's to HTML

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html
5. PLAINTEXT is deprecated. Use PRE, and use a sed script
to change < to &#60, > to &#62, and & to &#38.

6. http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/HTMLGeneration/dir2html.txt
This thing doesn't quote attributes; it uses XMP in stead of
PRE with numeric character references.

7. http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/HTMLGeneration/ls2html.awk.txt
Quotes around HREFS, PLAINTEXT.

8. http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Implementation/asis.txt
Quote HREFS, numeric character references where necessary.

9. http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/HytelnetGate/src/htn2html.c
Uses HEADER in stead of HEAD.
Quote HREFs.
Special character entities?
Yeah! It uses numeric character references already!

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html
10. Mark-up again

11. This text seems out of place:
WWW parsers should
ignore tags which they do not understand,
and ignore attributes which they
do not understand of tags which they
do understand.

12. Default text: this node seems to confuse lots of issues. I suggest
we get rid of it. The way to look at HTML is as a stream of data and
markup. Newlines are handled differently all over the place. It might
be reasonable to talk about how newlines are handled by the text
formatter, after they have been handed over from the SGML parser.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html
13. This text is out of place: 
Each tag starts
with a tag opener (a less than sign)
and ends with a tag closer (a greater
than sign).   Many tags have corresponding
closing tags which identical except
for a slash after the tag opener.

It's more thoroughly discussed in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Connolly/Current/Text.html
[which still needs revision: it's correct, but could use better
organization.]

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HEAD.html
14. These blurbs should probably quote their element declarations
from the DTD, in order to help folks learn to read the DTD.
"Only certain elements are allowed" is vague: there are restrictions
about the order and occurence sometimes too.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/TITLE.html
15. This seems redundant:
The title of a document is given
between title tags:
<pre>		&#60;TITLE&#62; ... &#60;/TITLE&#62;
</pre>
Lexical details should be discussed elsewhere. The example is
good, but the mention of tags is out of place.

16. What does this mean?
It should
[...]
ideally fit on one line.

17. Should the TITLE element be CDATA, RCDATA, or PCDATA?
If we want to be able to use Latin chars in the title,
it can't be CDATA. The only difference between RCDATA
and PCDATA (with no subelements allowed) is that comments
are recognized in PCDATA, whereas they are just regular
data in RCDATA.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/ISINDEX.html
18. The word "Format" connotes lexical details, which are discussed
elsewhere. I endorse the use of examples, but I'd like to keep
the model of
	SGML source ==parser==> ESIS ==WWW semantics==>formatted output
consistent. The WWW semantics processor doesn't deal with <>'s etc.
It just sees the presence of the ISINDEX element and acts accordingly.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/NEXTID.html
19. The status of each element should be noted consistently. e.g.
Mainstream	Consistently used by past, present, and future implementations.
Deprecated	In use and will be supported, but should be avoided. (XMP)
Obsolete	In use in some documents, but will not be supported. (NEXTID)
Proposed	Not yet in the DTD or widely supported (e.g. LINK)
Standard	Not yet widely supported, but will be (e.g. PRE)
Extra		It's legal to ignore these. (e.g. EM)

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/LINK.html
20. How many of these are allowed? I could change
<!ELEMENT HEAD - -  (TITLE? & ISINDEX? & NEXTID?)>
to
<!ELEMENT HEAD - -  (TITLE? & ISINDEX? & NEXTID? & LINK?)>
or
<!ELEMENT HEAD - -  (TITLE? & ISINDEX? & NEXTID? & LINK*)>
I don't know if the latter is legal SGML. I'd have to try
it out.

21. Link types are not well defined. The only reason to put
something in a public specification is so everybody can agree
on some semantics. If there are no semantics to agree on,
why include the TYPE attribute? (It's status is at best
"proposed" in my mind, though it's in the DTD.)

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Headings.html
22. "(at least six)" -- how about exactly six? Though I've
seen a lot of style guides that frown on anything more than 4.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/SGML.html
23. We should give at least one complete reference to the standard, i.e.

	ISO 8879:1986, Information Processing -- Text and
        Office Systems -- Standard Generalized Markup Language
                         (SGML)

24. In the Archive section, we could metion comp.text.sgml,
the SGMLs parser materials, and the ifi.uio.no archive.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/A.html
25. All attribute values have to be quoted, including NAME.
The example is wrong.

26. The TYPE attribute hardly seems worth mentioning. In the DTD,
it's a NAME, not just any old string.

27. We should look at modeling anchors as HyTime linkends
and/or ilinks.

28. We should look at modeling the LINK element as a HyTime
construct as well.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/P.html
29. I don't like the use of "exact representation" here:
The exact representation of
this (indentation,  leading, etc)
is not defined here, and may be a
function of other tags, style sheets
etc.

A reader could be confused between the source representation
and the rendered format. The source representation certainly
is defined. I'd say the "rendered representation" or some such.

30. Where are P's allowed? In the DTD, they're allowed in:
HTML, BODY, ADDRESS, BLOCKQUOTE, PRE but not in HEAD, A,
CODE, SAMP, etc.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Lists.html
31. Ordered lists: Obsolete or Standard?

32. "The format is:" Here again, this is an example, but it's
hardly a specification of the format of a UL element.

33. What does this mean?
The opening list tag  must be immediately
followed by the first list element.

34. The important difference between UL, MENU, and DIR is not
how they are displayed, but their semantic meanings. A MENU
is a list of things to choose from. A DIR is a list of names
in a directory.

35. We could also make this semantic distinction between PRE,
XMP, and LISTING, were it not for the syntactic confusion
surrounding XMP and LISTING.

36. Get rid of this:
the closing tag must obviously match
the opening tag.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/PRE.html
37. Wording of the newline documentation:
Line boundaries within the text are
significant, except for one immediately
following or immediatly preceding
a tag.

I don't like saying "newlines are significant" or "not significant."
Something like "newline characters shall be rendered as line breaks..."
or "newlines shall be ignored by the renderer..." would be better.

38. Semantics of newlines in PRE. Given the current DTD, a newline
after the PRE start tag or before the PRE end tag is not reported
by an SGML parser.

I think I can cook up some magic SHORTREF declarations that will
cause the SGML parser to report the newlines (possibly as P tags).
[This would obviate the need for special newline processing code
in libHTML]

In any case, I'd suggest that ALL NEWLINES REPORTED BY THE SGML
PARSER IN THE PRE ELEMENT BE DISPLAYED AS LINE BREAKS. That only
leaves the issue of which newlines are reported, which is governed
by the SGML standard.

39. I don't like the way this is worded:
The &#60;p&#62; tag should not be used.
If found, it should be interpreted
as a single new line.

I'd suggest: "it should be displayed as a line break" to avoid treating
<P> as "\n" and interpreting "\n" in some strange way.

40. "... character character highlighing elements may be used."
Ack! I don't recommend this! Hmmm... maybe only the B, I, and U
elements. This certainly conflicts with the current DTD.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Highlighting.html
41. These have status "Extra"
Where not supported by implementations,
like all tags, these should be ignored.<p>

This should be a warning to providers that some information may
be lost on some browsers.

42. (Definition of these and reference
- Dan?)
They come from TeXinfo.

43. I left the TeXinfo @file element out. I don't remember why.
It might have been an oversight. Do we want it in there?

44. Examples (TBD) see complete.html in my stuff.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html#z41
45. The PLAINTEXT tag terminates the HTML entity. What
follows is not SGML. In stead, there's an HTTP convention
that what follows is a text/plain body.

46. "The text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters" --
this conflicts with the DTD. I think a design that treats Latin
characters as external data entities is cleaner than one that
treats them as text characters, but I'm willing to go the
other way.

47. "including the
tag opener, so long as it does not
contain the closing tag in full."
For Pete's sake, could we get this out of there once and for all?
Perhaps it deserves a historical note or something, but we can't
leave it in as part of the standard. I'm willing to support
unquoted attribute values, but not this.

48. "The <a  NAME="z22">XMP tag</a>..." Use the term "element". The

I think we should specify ISO latin 1 as the base set.  I think that  
a lot of people in the nordic countries use it routinely and they
will go crazy if they have to use overload the crurly brackets again
as they have to with mail.

Therefore, we should allow those people who have 8-bit capability to
just stick in 8-bit codes.  Admitedly I thought the ISO world kept to
the codes 21-7E and A1-FE hex for G0 and G1 graphics sets, using the  
others for control sets (C0 and C1). Maybe ISO Lantin 1 has nothing  
to do with ISO 8 bit extensions. Sorry I can't quote ISO numbers.
But whatever is common usage, let us have an 8 bit set.

(Anybody illuminate us on this?  Anybody got the ISO Latin 1  
character set listing by number?)

Now for died in the wool 7-bit hackers, is it fair to requier them to  
remember numbers, or would it be nicer to allow them to put in
codes using entity names?  Some people would I am sure like the  
latter, but it is NOT important because we are aiming for wysiwyg  
editors and so would regard human-readable character names as a  
temporary thing anyway.

No - that is something different. In the top of the DTD is specified  
the reference base set for the DTD itself and SGML documents.
The interface between two software modules is something else and can  
be independent of that.

Sorry, is iso8559  = Iso latin 1?  (I have no head for numbers >1 :-)

yes it is cool. Use Midas or Viola to look at the Hyper-G stuff and  
it works very nicely.

Yup. Big deal?  Not really. Just a set of parallel tables.  Peter  
Flynn of the CURIA project is producing a lot of archived gaelic and  
is currently dealing with a requirement for a line-mode browser which  
can switch its characetr set depending on the terminal emulator the  
reader is using.

Problems only occur if there are characters which can't be mapped 1-1  
to the local set, and must be represented by more than one character  
(like uumlaut -> ue, ae dipthong -> ae etc) AND you can edit, in  
which case the original form must be preserved. In this case, passing  
on of the entity is essential.  But doing it for every character >127  
would be a pain memorywise. So I would suggest that a configuable  
table define which entities can be crunched down to a single  
character in the local representation and the rest be passed on from  
the SGML parser to the SGML app as external entities.

There is of course nothing wrong with having two roots -- one as a  
specification and one as a user guide.   The specification should be  
more formal and use the correct terminology without apology, the  
burden of understanding being on the reader.  The user guide must  
start with the vocabulary expected of the new reader, and introduce  
things in an "easy" order. The onus of explanation is on the writer  
of the guide in this case, as we WANT people to write/output HTML.

Ideally of couse one would rewrite the whole thing but we haven't  
time, so the details about each element had best be represented just  
once.

I think we need a version of www which runs off RFCxxx-conforming  
RFCs, unless someone can do it with TeX.  Then we can feed it a  
stream of concatenated HTML.  We will need it for HTTP2 too.

     There are a number of reasons why it might not be sensible
   to cache a document, eg in my local server I have a page 
   entitled "Current state of the network". This is a smart doc,
   refreshed everytime it is accessed. Caching this is just plain 
   silly. Thus a general mechanism (separate from access restrictions)
   is needed to prevent caching where it is unsuitable.
     Given that a general mechanism is also needed for cache timeouts,
   it seems sensilble to amalgamate the two, ie documents that should
   not be cached simply have their cache timeouts (TTL's) set to zero.
     Note that within the PROTOCOL, cache timing information should
   not be embedded within documents, for the simple reason that in the
   future such information will be needed for non-text bodyparts,
   ie my network status page might become a graphic, but it still
   should not be cached. Note that this does not stop any server
   IMPLEMENTATION from reading caching info embedded into in HTML,
   merely that the protocol (the bits on the wire) should be able to
   seperate the two.

       How does a server know if it "understands" readership groups ?
     How do I know if my Dave Raggett is the same as your Dave Raggett ?
     This information cannot be passed between servers; we would need
     a global naming scheme - X.500 distinguished names won't do
     as X.500 is not commonly enough used, e-mail addresses probably
     aren't good enough (at a quick count I can be reached through
     about 20 addresses at 4 institutes in 2 countries, does this
     mean that my membership or otherwise of a readership group
     depends on where I am logged on ?). We would also need a global
     authentication scheme ...
       This comes back to the idea that the only documents that should
     be cached are those whose read access is totally unlimited. Any
     other form of read access (ie, billed access to private data,
     logged access, restricted access) should require talking to
     the original server, not to some cached copy.

Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch



We are considering holding a three-day workshop on the World-Wide Web
at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) on or close to Wednesday 7th to Friday  
9th July 1993.   (The IETF meeting in Amsterdam, that starts on  
Monday 12th July).

The workshop would probably have three sections

1.	Tutorial sessions on what WWW is, how it works, and (mainly)
	how you set up clients and servers.  This would be for
	users who nood not know anything of WWW but should be
	computer litterate.
	
2.	Presentations by those who have already used the web in
	various different ways, with their findings and comments.
	
3.	A technical brainstorming (RFC editing?) session on
	protocols and data formats (HTTP and HTML).
	
The idea would be that people would not have to come for all of it:  
experienced WWWWizards could come on section (day?) 2, and users not  
interested in future development would leave after day 2.

	Anyone interested? 

	Suggestions?
	Would you come?
	Would you prefer another date
	-- are there things clashing with that date?

When replying, (to me, not to the list) if I don't know you please  
indicate whether you and your institute are involved in physics,  
software, networking, etc.

Thanks

Not sure about that one. Ther are several ways of mapping FAQs onto  
HTML as it is ... I would prefer to see for example a MENU of

People writing SGML don't want to know about parser and formatters  
(an arbitray distinction which is very questionable in the definition  
of a DTD or SGML -- it is only relevant to the definition of the  
software interface to an SGML engine)

Well then maybe the USENET FAQ project needs a separate DTD. I'm
willing to table the issue for now.

So lt, gt, and amp are "Deprecated" rather than "Obsolete", that
is, they are not recommended, but they will be supported. In that
case, we should update the DTD to include them.

The distinction between parsers and formatters (i.e. applications)
is very much defined by SGML: a conforming application is not allowed
to act on anything but the ESIS. For example, it's illegal to
treat attribute values delimited by single quotes differently from
those surrounded by double quotes, because that information is
not reported by the parser. The same is true for newlines: it's
illegal to treat
<foo>
content
</foo>
different from <foo>content</foo> because the difference is
not reported by the parser (unless we do some shortref magic
to force the parser to report the difference.)

In any case, I think "people writing SGML" is the group for
whom an understanding of these issues is most critical.
They should be referred to the implementors' guide. This
business of "default text" or "Character Data" is thoroughly
discussed in "Text and Markup" under "Parsing content into
data and markup" and in "Recommended Usage" under "Body elements."

I wrote the "Text and Markup" node to replace this "Default Text"
or "Character Data" node, and I still think the node does
more harm than good.

I took great pains to make "Text and Markup" an
accessible yet correct intro to SGML syntax. I'd like
to see folks referred to that document for these issues.
If it's not readable, let's fix it.

We must be very careful
of two things: 1. that these redundant informal blurbs
do not in any way conflict with the SGML standard,
and 2. that they are not misleading.

This blurb mostly passes criteria 1: all tags do
indeed start with a less than sign (and I guess
"tag opener" is close enough to "start tag open delimiter"
though "... which is identical except for a slash after
the tag opener" is goofy. </, the end tag open delimiter,
is not viewed as a start tag open delimiter followed by
a slash.)

But not all less than signs indicate tags: a less than
sign is only recognized as STAGO when it's followed by
a letter.  And most A end tags are hardly identical
to their start tag, even modulo the slash. The case
of the start tag can be different from the case of the
end tag. I fear that folks will read this blurb and
write broken sed scripts.

Certainly there should be a link from this blurb to
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Connolly/Current/Text.html#Tags

Excellent idea. But again, there are maintenance issues we must
sort out.

>That's where I got to

I certainly appreciate the speedy response, and the notes
of encouragement I got from a few others.

I am much more confident that this will all be resolved soon.

I'm perfectly happy using existing HTML to format the FAQs.  I wrote perl
scripts that convert the comp.unix.questions and comp.lang.perl FAQs
into hypertext.  They were done just as a proof of concept, go get an
idea of what it would look like.  They are available at
"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/information/information.html"

(This address is subject to change)

I'd also like to express the opinion that we shouldn't make the HTML so
terribly specific.  Every new situation shouldn't require another addition
to HTML.  If that were the case, we'd never be finished.

I don't think we should do any shortref magic.  The simplest thing
(the way it works now) is that the two examples above are identical.
I say this is fine.  If someone wants to stick a new-line in at the
beginning of some section, they can just stick it in there:

<foo>

content
</foo>

Well, suffice it to say that HTML doesn't give much semantic
information. It would be nice to express relationships between
pieces of information through the document structure, but in
HTML we mostly use links.

But it's a royal pain to implement! Doing full SGML newline processing
by the standard is quite involved (see the article by Eric Naggum
in comp.text.sgml about SGML and Records that I referenced in
an earlier message). For example, you can't just get rid of all
newlines immediately before or after tags, like it says in the
web: Only those right after a start tag (of a non-empty element),
right before an end tag,
or the ones on a line containing only comments and processing instructions.
Newlines around <P> tags, for example, _are_ reported.

If we don't stick the SHORTREF magic in the DTD to force the
parser to report all newlines, we'll end up with countless hacks
at newline processing, none of which matches the standard, and
it'll be luck if any of them matches each other.

Not necessarily.  Carefully define which new-lines have to be ignored.
This may yield something complex.  But then, you are still free to ignore
more new-lines than that in several different places, thus reducing the
problem.  In other words, it is up to the formatting program to decide
how to interpret them.  If it decides to throw out a few more new-lines
at the beginning or end of various data elements, life becomes much
easier.

You might have countless hacks, but since formatters ar allowed to
format things differently, does it matter?

Take this example:

  Here's some text<P>And some more text
  <P>
  And some final text.

SGML may say this:

  \nHere's some text
  (P
  )P
  And some more text\n
  (P
  )P
  \nAnd some final text.

But the formatter is still free to toss those new-lines at the beginning
and end of each paragraph (and in fact it had better if you don't want
a space at the beginning of your paragraphs).

If people seem to be leaving it to you then that is becuase you are  
doing a good job.  I for one very much appraeciate it!  I have left  
you completeley with editorship of the document I know.  I will take  
it back again if you like.  Things will be so much easier when we  
have a checkin/checkout function.

I think that everyone agrees that SGML conformance is very important,  
but there are not many who are into it SGML to tangle with it in the  
way you can.

(I know I should get sgmls up, but I haven;t even brought up half the  
new browsers which have appeared, and I have to support a CERN user  
community of real users and service providers.  So free time is  
nonexistent (having a little family may have something to do with  
that too...). And there is HTTP2 which needs trial implementation as  
well.

We get a student (Arthur Secret is coming back) in March which should  
help.

I haven't released my code yet, as I'm still trying to figure out what
the changes to the spec mean to me :-)

I can post what I have at the moment, but it doesn't take advantage of
the new TeXinfo stuff.

[begin excuses]
Unfortunately, My job only permits me a couple of hours a day on this
project, and that includes coming up with local documentation.
[end excuses]

But you're right.

I personally believe this is one of the most important projects going
on on the internet right now.  I think you're doing a wonderful job,
getting things right, dealing with everybody's (like mine) annoying
criticism, etc.  But your doing this thing right, and I like it.

So how about a constructive idea?  I won't be able to implement this
until three weeks from now since I'm bouncing to two different
conferences for the next two weeks, but:

I could easily write a robot which would roam around the Web (perhaps
stochastically?), and verify the html, using sgmls.  Then, whenever
I come across something that's non-compliant, I could automatically
send mail to wwwmaster@sitename.  No one would have to annoy anyone else
about whether or not they've verified their HTML; a program would annoy
them automatically.

All we have to do is agree to set up the wwwmaster aliases.  (In the
event of bounce-o-grams, we could always annoy the postmaster, or
failing that, root.)

This would also be a good chance to map out the entire Web.  Anyone
know any good algorithms for drawing arbitrary directed graphs with
no overlap?  Which reminds me, a good directed graph is the right way
to implement a history mechanism.  Somebody want to take a crack at
it?

Sounds cool. This points out yet another thing the WAIS folks did
right: every database has an associated maintainer as part of
the protocol. WWW could learn a lot from WAIS.

Perhaps HTML2 will provide a handle on how to get ahold of the relavent

Ever heard of map coloring problems? You can't draw an arbitrary
directed graph with no overlap. The set of graphs that you can
draw is the subject of great study, I believe. They're called
"planar" graphs.

This is another area where the HyTime folks have done a lot
of thinking that we should try to take advantage of.

I have written a robot that does this, except it doesn't check for
valid SGML -- it just tries to map out the entire web.  I believe I
found roughly 50 or 60 different sites (this was maybe 2 months ago --
I'm sorry, I didn't save the output).  It took the robot about half a
day (a saturday morning) to complete.

There were several problems.

First, some sites were down and my robot would spend a considerable
time waiting for the connection to time out each time it found a link
to such a site.  I ended up remembering the last error from a site and
skipping sites that were obviously down, but there are many different
errors you can get, depending on whether the host is down,
unreachable, doesn't run a WWW server, doesn't recognize the document
address you want, or has some other trouble (some sites were going up
and down while my robot was running, causing additional confusion).

Next, more importantly, some sites have an infinite number of
documents.  There are several causes for this.

First, several sites have gateways to the entire VMS documentation (I
have never used VMS but apparently the VMS help system is a kind of
hypertext).  While not exactly infinite the number of nodes is *very*
large.  Luckily such gateways are easily recognized by the kind of
pathname they use, and VMS help is unlikely to contain pointers to
anything except more VMS help, so I put in a simple trap to stop
these.

Next, there are other gateways.  I can't remember whether I
encountered a Gopher or WAIS gateway, but these would have even worse
problems.

Finally, some servers contain bugs that cause loops, by referencing to
the same document with an ever-growing path.  (The relative path
resolving rules are tricky, and I was using my own www client which
isn't derived from Tim's, which made this more severe, but I have also
found occurrences reproducible  with the CERN www client.)

Although I didn't specifically test for bad HTML, I did have to parse
the HTML to find the links, and found occasional errors.  I believe
there are a few binaries, PostScript and WP files that have links to
them, which take forever to fetch.  There were also various
occurrences of broken addresses here and there -- this was a good
occasion for me to debug my www client library.

If people are interested, I could run the robot again and report a
summary of the results.

I also ran a gopher robot, but after 1600 sites I gave up...  The
Veronica project in the Gopher world does the same and makes the
results available as a database, although the last time I tried it the
veronica server seemed too overloaded to respond to a simple query.

If you want source for the robots, the're part of the Python source
distribution: ftp to ftp.cwi.nl, directory, pub/python, file
python0.9.8.tar.Z.  The robot (and in fact my entire www and gopher
client library) is in the tar archive in directory python/demo/www.
The texinfo to html conversion program that I once advertized here is
also there.  (I'm sorry, you'll have to built the python interpreter
from the source before any of these programs can be used...)
Note that my www library isn't up with the latest HTML specs, this is
a hobby project and I neede my time for other things...

Subject: suggested libWWW architecture
Date: Wed, 13 Jan 93 19:11:15 CST
From: Dan Connolly <connolly@pixel.convex.com>


I sent this to tim a while ago, but I don't think
he's had time to look at it.

Meanwhile, libWWW is becomming reentrant, but I still
think the architecture is kinda clumsy: you have to
have a big data structure describing the DTD, and
a routine for each element, etc.

This doesn't mesh well with the MidasWWW architecture, which
can read the DTD from the X resource database at
runtime.

I have an idea for an architecture that the linemode and
MidasWWW could share (along with other new implementations).

It's not radically different from the current libWWW, but
there's a lot of grunt-work between the current libWWW
and what I've got here. But I think the end result would
be much more usable.

We start with the HText class. In stead of the various
style and append methods, we have four methods in a
virtual function table:

typedef struct{
  int (*start_tag) PARAMS((SGML_Object this, CONST char* gi,
			    CONST char** attributes, int nattrs));
  VOID (*end_tag) PARAMS((SGML_Object this, CONST char* gi));

  VOID (*entity) PARAMS((SGML_Object this, CONST char* name));

  VOID (*data) PARAMS((SGML_Object this, CONST char* data, int char_qty));
}SGML_DocClass;

The linemode would declare something like:

SGML_DocClass griddoc = {HText_start_tag, HText_end_tag,
			HText_entity, HText_data};

The HText implementation is responsible for keeping track of
the stack of open elements, if it needs to.

On top of these we build some format parsing routines:

SGML_parse(void* dest, void* closure, void* stream, int (getc)(void*));
/* psuedocode:
   int read, content;
   char buffer[1000];
   SGML_DocClass *docclass = (SGML_DocClass*)closure;

   while( (read = SGML_read(buffer, content, stream, getc)) != EOF){
     switch(read){
       case SGML_start_tag:
         ... parse name, attributes ...
         content = (docclass->startTag)(dest, name, attrs);
         if(content = empty){
           (docclass->endTag)(name);
           content = MIXED; /*@@ could be ELEMENT */
         }
         break;

       case SGML_end_tag:
         ... parse name ...
         (docclass->endTag)(name);
         content = MIXED; /*@@ could be ELEMENT */
         break;

       case SGML_entity:
         (docclass->entity)(data, name);
         break;

       default:
         (docclass->data)(dest, buffer);
    }
*/

PlainText_parse(HText* dest, void* docclass, void* stream, int (getc)(void*));
/* psuedocode:
   (docclass->startTag)(dest, "HTML");
   (docclass->startTag)(dest, "BODY");
   (docclass->startTag)(dest, "PRE");
   keep a local buffer of about 1000 chars.
   Call (getc)(stream) until EOF.
   Call HText_data(dest, buffer) whenever buffer is full.
   (docclass->endTag)(dest, "PRE");
   (docclass->endTag)(dest, "BODY");
   (docclass->endTag)(dest, "HTML");
*/

GopherListing_parse(HText* dest, void* dummy, void* stream, int (getc)(void*));
/* psuedocode:
   (docclass->startTag)(dest, "HTML");
   (docclass->startTag)(dest, "BODY");
   (docclass->startTag)(dest, "MENU");
   while(Gopher_parse_line(stream, getc, type, name, host, port, path)){
      char addr[BIG];
      sprintf(addr, "gopher://%s:%d/%c%s", host, port, type, path);
      (docclass->startTag)(dest, "A",
                       "HREF", addr,
                       0);
      (docclass->data)(dest, name);
      (docclass->endTag)(dest, "A");
   }
   (docclass->endTag)(dest, "MENU");
   (docclass->endTag)(dest, "BODY");
   (docclass->endTag)(dest, "HTML"); 
*/


We register each of these with the following routine:

int
ContentType_register(CONST char* type, CONST char* subtype,
		HTParseProc parse, void* closure);

For example:

main()
{
  ContentType_register("TEXT", "X-HTML", HTML_parse, griddoc);
  ContentType_register("TEXT", "PLAIN", PlainText_parse, griddoc);
  ContentType_register("APPLICATION", "X-GOPHER",
			 GopherListing_parse, griddoc);
}


The following routine can be used for any MIME entity. It will dispatch
the appropriate parsing routine based on the content type header:

int
ContentType_parse(const char* ct, HText* dest, void* stream, int (getc)(void*));


Then we build some load routines, one per access scheme:
(note that this design separates format from the access scheme, which
allows us to, for example, load a gopher menu
from a local file, or load HTML text from a Gopher server)

/* I don't have error handling worked out yet. We need to have a coherent
   design for this. It's a mess in the current WWWlib. */

/* I think the WWW file: should be split into ftp: and local-file:.
   It's cleaner to implement; there are precedents in the MidasWWW local:
   scheme and the MIME ftp and local-file access-types. */

int
LocalFile_load(HText* dest, CONST char* path, CONST char* search)
{
  FILE* stream;

  if(stream = fopen(path)){
    const char* content_type = WWW_zen_content_type_from_extension(path);
    ContentType_parse(content_type, dest, (void*)stream, (int ()(void*))getc);
    fclose(stream);
    return 1;
  }else{
    /* log an error */
    return 0;
  }
}

int
FTP_load(HText* dest, CONST char* path, CONST char* search);

int
HTTP_load(HText* dest, CONST char* path, CONST char* search);

int
Gopher_load(HText* dest, CONST char* path, CONST char* search);
{
  const char* content_type = Gopher_zen_content_type_from_gtype_char(*path);
  char* host = HTParse(path, PARSE_HOST);
  char* portnum = HTParse(path, PARSE_PORT);
  int port = atoi(portnum);
  static char* tab = "\007";
  static char* crlf = "\015\012";

  void* stream = TCPOpen(host, port);

  if(stream){
    TCPwrite(stream, path, strlen(path);
    if(search){
      TCPwrite(stream, tab, 1);
      TCPwrite(stream, search, strlen(search);
    }
    TCPwrite(stream, crlf, 2);
    ContentType_parse(content_type, dest, stream, TCPgetc);
    TCPclose(stream);
    return 1;
   }else{
    /* log an error */
    return 0;
   }
}


Then we register these just like formats:

HTAccess_register(const char* name, HTLoadProc load, void* closure);


And the HTLoadDocument routine in HTAccess.c becomes this:

int
HTAccess_load(HText* dest, HTParentAnchor* p, CONST char* address)
{
  char* scheme = HTParse(address, PARSE_SCHEME);
  /* path is everything after the colon, except the anchor */
  char* path = HTParse(address, PARSE_HOST|PARSE_PORT|PARSE_PATH);
  char* anchor = HTParse(address, PARSE_ANCHOR);
  char* search = HTParse(address, PARSE_SEARCH_TERMS);
  HText dest = HText_new(p); /* check for doc already loaded in p @@ */
  void* closure;
  HTLoadProc load;

  if(load = /* load routine registered for scheme. find closure too */){
    (load)(dest, path, search, closure);
  }
  HTSelect(dest, anchor);
}


What do you think?

If you do run your robot again I would be very interested if you could 
generate a simple list of document titles and their corresponding 
document id's (or URL's). We have a powerful spires database here, 
interfaced to the web, which we could easily import such a file into to 
great a VERONICA like index of the web. I think that would be pretty 
useful (unless someone is already doing it??).

One other problem to add to you list.....many documents are probably 
only accessible by giving a "keyword" . Unless you can write a robot 
which can successfully guess all possible keywords, you cannot 
gaurantee to be able to traverse the whole web.

I agree.  Here are some comments along the same lines I sent Tim a while back.

From Tim:
>Re "local:"
>     
>The actual implementation of "file": in WWW checks the hostname to see
>whether it is the local host, and if so uses direct file access.
>(It also checks /Net/<hostname>/<path> in case of NFS mounting)

>The IETF WG wanted "ftp:" to be available, so I have made that a synonym >for
>"file:".

My immediate reason for implementing local was that MidasWWW implements "file:" 
through the gateway, and so I needed some other temporary way to access local 
files. When MidasWWW supports "file:" directly I may get rid of local (or make 
it a synonym for file maybe). However I do have some other problems with the 
file implementation, mainly the confusion between files access by ftp and files 
accessed locally. Problems are:

a) How to tell whether a specified node is the "local" node? The /NET test is 
not portable, it doesn't work on our Unix system here (we use /nfs here). It 
works even less well on VAX clusters.

b) Even if I could tell that the file is on the local node, things still would 
not work since /pub is NOT the root of the anonymous FTP directory. I.e. 
file://localhost/test.html is NOT the same as local:/pub/test.html. Again this 
applies even more to non-unix systems.

Both of these problems tempt me to keep local:, or some equivalent. Comments?

Tom,

Great idea, LOTS of applications.  Traversing a tree to a given depth
makes a book.  Tony's WWWVeronica is a great idea -- particularly as  
it can pick up WAIS indexes and Gopher and telent sites all together  
and make a megaIndex of the whole scene!

Implementation ideas:   The WWW library anchor object actually keeps  
track of every anchor visited.   It uses a hash table to speed up the  
generation of new names.  The HTAnchor_findParent or somesuch routine  
find it if it exists otherwise creates it.  You just need a return  
code to tell you whether you have a new one or not, whether to  
truncate the search there.

You could use the HTRules translation table for controlling the  
domain of search.  Useful things to do with the search  are

1. list all references OUT of the domain from within it
	For example, find all telnet sites listed in Hytelnet.
	List all WAIS indexes mentioned in the Web's WAIS catalogue.
2. list all referencs within, depth-first, with depth indication
	This can drive a book-making script
3. Apply command to everything within the domain
	for checking
	etc etc

I even wondered about putting the traverse code into the library do  
that arbitrary browsers could use it.  It would generate a hypertext  
list of all objects found for example.

I suggest webmaster aliases for server-wide responsability and
a typed link for authorship of any given document.   Many
servers provide stuff from many areas, one person is not
responsible for everything.  Our local mainframe doc system
has a function key dedicated to "who is responsible for the runnish  
on my screen?!" function.   This is important for up-to-date info,
accountability.

I see this as one good use for a link type.  Something I have
wondered about a lot is a namespace for people in the URL scheme.
You can even find something about them using SMTP if they
are on the internet.
 <A HREF="mail:timbl@info.cern.ch" TYPE="author">tim</A>

Following the link would give options of mailing the person.

I think we are allowed to let lines cross.  Just than minimising the
number of crossings (the "badness") is almose certainly np complete
But in fact a tree will probably be less confusing for people.

I like history trees like

AAAAAAAAAAA
  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
  CCCCCCCCCCCCC CCC C
  DDD DDDDDDDD
     EEEEEEEEEEEE
     AAAAAAAAAAAA *
     BBBBBBBBBBBBB *
  FFFFFFFFFF FFFFFF
     DDDDDD *
  GGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

wheer * indicates that the links from that node are listed at a same  
or higher level in the tree.  (You could give  line number  
cross-refernece or a link to the listing).  This is gives the real

An addition to the server etiquette rules in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Etiquette.html
says that for any internet host running a WWW server there should be  
a mail alias
	
	webmaster@hostname

to which problems with the server can be reported.

Remember also that it is wise to set up a domainname alias for
your server: rather than referring to it as  mysun4.cc.fred.edu
make an alias for example

	www.fred.edu

so that if you change machines, the alias can be switched to the new  
server.

	Thanks for your time, keep up the good work!

I agree that the map produced by traversing all of WWW would be
QUITE large and that it would be more efficiently searched as
an Index (WWWVeronica), if the output of the Robot were Text.

A new twist: (I am still trying to catch up on all the features &
functionality of WWW, so if WWW already does this, please tell me)

Is it possible for a user of WWW to see, graphically, a map of the
Web?  If the client software had a map to work with, instead of a
book, and the user could point at a spot on the map and select it,
then I think it would be a lot easier to navigate.

There could be a "short-range" scan which would show a close-up view
of the web links all around the current node, upto around 3 or 4
levels.

There could be a "long-range" scan which would show a global
view of the Web, leaving out the details of the local links.

This requires an extension beyond hypertext into hypermedia, of
course.

Anyway, would hyper-graphical representations of the Web be useful?
If it is worthwhile, is it doable?

Good point.

 - If we specify Latin 1 as the base set, can't wehave latin 1
   characters in CDATA?

 - If we can't, then I guess we use PCADATA as it would be the
   only place except for <XMP> and <LISTING> where we can use
   RCDATA.

Yes.  OK.  But I want as I said before (unless the crash lost the
message) to have two documents out of this. One is the HTML spec for  
MIME IANA registration.  The other is a readable document which is  
NOT 100% a precise refernce document but can be read by human beings  
WITHOUT SGML knowledge.  I can guess that this document will have 10  
times the readership of the other if it is readable, as <10% of the  
people creating HTML will know about SGML CROs etc etc.

It is good to have a lot of cross-reference between them.

We have almost as many categories as elements!  I'd add
Obsolescent	Will be obsolete when the alternative implementation
		(eg HTTP2) is available.
		
I'd make PRE mainstream as there are no implementations for which a  
new PRE-understanding version is not available or easily made  
available. And so cut out "Standard"  OOps I put it in again  
...see#31.

I have made NEXTID Mainstream.  Editors need it: can't do without it
really.  I would perhaps change it to <EDITING NEXTID=z27> if that  
was felt to be more logical.

We also need a hook for a version for the checkin/out/lock logic  
DAN(?) proposed.  That was that when you
lock or PUT a document, you specify the version so that a document  
can be PUT or CHECKED IN by a different person to the one who GoT it.
This means the server gives a key, a version or date code, with the  
document. This is all HTTP2 except when a document is stored  
somehwre, passed around and then eventually returned to the server.  
In that case, it needs a place to hold its original version number
on the server.

Yes and no.  We need some well-define link type but we also need this  
as a hook for the future which we haven't enugh experience.  Link
types whould be registered.

This is a flexibility point, but it must be firm ... like
a towing ball on the back of your pickup you want to be able
to connect anything onto it but you want it well fixed onto the  
truck!

But I want to make it REL instead of TYPE as people think TYPE
refers to the object type of the desdtination object rather than the  
link.  (From messages on this list).

I agree.  I wuld frown ony anything over 3 in a hypertext document.
However, it is useful to generate a great big HTML document by
concatenating little ones, demoting their heading levels. You then  
print the big document. This generates up to 6 easily.  Maybe we  
should go to 9 but frown on >4.

I have cahnged NAME to ne a NAME -- ie doc-wide unique which it must   
be. Numberic ones are then not valid but I donb't generate them any  
more.  I think that we should stick to the intended ID system. In the  
future, we can think about IDs on many other elements.

That's right.  They are not in the CERN implementations allowed in

Yes and no.  I too like logical definitions -- I am sold on semantic  
markup but HTML is to cover a vast range of data and semantics. MENU
These things are NOT necessarily what their names suggest -- many a  
selectable menu is set out as a DIR or a DL. The element names are
mnemonic only.  The blurb talks about how much text is in the  
paragraphs.

We coudl but we are deprecating XMP and LISTINg and PRE will do for

Serious point here folks.  There was a great demand for B I U
for man pages and the like. Why prohibit anything other than TT.
or to keep it simple, allow anything and mention TT should not be  
used, and the constraints of fixed width may limit the ability to  
render some highlighting.

I have introduced %htext noting that text always occurred with A.
I hope I have done it right.

I would like them in the DTD. While people are still reading/writing
HTML they are useful. My mental ASCII table is in hex, not decimal,  
anyway.  Are they any overhead? Why the war against them? For the ISO
characters you wanted the opposite.  (Does your menatl ASCII table  
stop at 128? Mine too)

This BLOCKQUOTE... it should be one thing or the other.
If it cannot contain other paragraph styles then it should be a  
paragraph style like address, and not be able to contain address.
This is easy for everyone to implement.

If it can contain ADDRESS then why not let it contain anything - in  
particular, headings. Trouble is, I can't represent that in RTF  
easily so than blows the NeXT and Mac browsers. So let's
make it 

<!ELEMENT BLOCKQUOTE - - (%htext;|P)+>
like ADDRESS, and bear it in mind for HTML3 which will have SECTION  
in, ie without the linear RTF constraint.

Hmmm.
1. In fact, <DL COMPACT> looks very similar and has less narrow a  
meaning.
2.In fact the headers inforation could rather be regarded as part of  
the  metainfo in the <HEAD> element. Many of the RFC822 things will  
in fact be outside the document in the HTTP layer.  This is a bit  
chick-and-egg. Here we are describing an SGML dtd for a spoecific  
format for a MIME_wrapped RFC822 body, and in it we want to put the  
RFC822 header. Hmmm.  Something has got muddled. But I understand  
what you mean: very often one quotes mail messages as text. Strictly,  
one shouldn't though. You shouldn't be able to edit the headers.

Currently there is DL COMPACT which does that. It is implemented in  
www. I am torn betwen generality and the preacticality of getting  
something defined and outthe door and I thinkl the latter wins so  
let's put COMPACT as an attribute for DL and leave the HEADERs if you  
don't mind too much.

They are rather different in that a comment can surround a whole

I'd prefer continuous zoom.  I've seen widgets that do this, although
I'm not sure where to find one.  At any rate the problem is solvable.

Not necessarily.  As the first pass, it can be implemented as history
for the browsers.  Combine that with a saveable history, and you could
just stick in the whole web into your history.

On the other hand, I have (very distant) plans to lay a WWW browser on
top of GhostScript.  The browser would convert to postscript (also
very convenient for printing).  Ghostscript provides hooks for inserting
mouse functionality, for the clicking, and away we go.

The point is this: once that's done, hypertext postscript just sort of
happens.  It's there, with no additional work whatsoever.

>Anyway, would hyper-graphical representations of the Web be useful?
>If it is worthwhile, is it doable?

Useful, yes; doable, yes; easy, no.

The hard part is telling a computer to lay out the graph.  You can assume
a tree structure for any given local site, and be mostly correct, but I
get the impression that the web is much more web-like across multiple
sites.  Evan assuming a tree structure, you have to make sure that non
of your non-tree links are drawn on top of each other (in parallel, that is).

Suppose we have a tree like this:

	      A
	     /|\
	    / | \
	   B  C  D

If B, C, and D are all inter-linked, you can't draw their links and
have them all be visible, unless you move one of B, C, or D; or use
curved lines as links (anybody know how they generate the Usenet
maps?).  The specific solution is obvious, but generalizing it is not
(to me, anyway).

One concept that would probably help is grouping.  It's common that a
large body of documetation has a single entry point (or at least a
small number of them).  These could be displayed as a single element in
the map, until a certain zoom level is reached.  A good first guess
would be that each site is a single entity.

Parting Shot - does it occur to anyone that a Virtual Reality interface
might provide the best view of the web, and the best way of traversing it?
And does it also occur to anyone that this view of the web might look
a lot like the cyberspace described by author William Gibson?

Issues 1-10 are resolved to my satisfaction.

>> 11. This text seems out of place:

Well, it's mentioned in tolerated.html, but that's hardly
the place to go looking for explanations. I suppose we
need a section telling implementors how to handle errors
or something.

12-16: OK.

I agree that CDATA is closest to the original intent. And yes,
if we include Latin 1 chars in the document character set, we
can put them in CDATA, but they'd have to be actual 8 bit
characters, and not numeric character references.

Furthermore, it presents a problem for HTML writers. It's convenient
to treat all data characters the same way, that is, replace <, >, &
with character references. If we make the TITLE CDATA, then HTML
writers must special case this element, and not do the replacement.
Furthermore, they're out of luck if they want to write "</x" where
x is any letter.

On the flip side, if they do replace <>& with references, old parsers
probably won't grok. But I think that's a small price to pay: titles
with <>& in them will look ugly on old implementations. No big deal.

So, in the end, I vote for RCDATA.

This brings me to issue
79. How do we maintain the DTD?
The annotated DTD is a great idea. But we need to be sure the
actual SGML code matches the hypertext version. It seems we can
derive the SGML from the hypertext with:
% www -n -source HTML.dtd.html >HTML.dtd
Then we just have to maintain the hypertext version. I'll do some
testing and get back to you.

Also, 
80. The hypertext version of the DTD has some non-PRE parts. I suspect
a NeXT browser bug.

18: OK, but the discussion relates to issue 50.

>Yes.  OK.  But I want as I said before (unless the crash lost the
>message) to have two documents out of this. One is the HTML spec for  
>MIME IANA registration.

I disagree. I still think the root of the HTML documentation should
look like:

<H1>HyperText Markup Language</H1>
<H3>Abstract</H3>...
<H2>Language Reference</H2>
        <A>Text and Markup</A>
        <A>The Elements</A>
        <A>Implementors' Guide</A>
<H2>Specification</H2>
        <A>the DTD</A>

I think this is madness. As I said before: it is exactly this group of
people, those writing HTML, that _must_ be aware of SGML syntax. The
"Text and Markup" document is about two pages of fairly readable
prose, in my opinion. If it's too much for folks to digest, let's do
something about that. But let's not create a priesthood here!

The whole point of my efforts is to make the HTML format
understandable by everyone who needs to understand it, while
maintaining SGML compliance.


>> In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/NEXTID.html
>> 19. The status of each element should be noted consistently. e.g.

We already have some understanding of what the status is. What I'm
after is a way to look up the status of an element by name. This
relates to other reference needs too:

81. We need an alphabetical index of the HTML elements. Perhaps we
should reorganize the DTD so they appear in order there? I thought
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html
was going to be an alphabetical element reference. But I see the
need for the present organization. Still, I think we need another
element reference node.

back to
58. Get rid of NEXTID?
>I have made NEXTID Mainstream.  Editors need it: can't do without it
>really.

Hardly. It's a redundant optimization only: the editor need simply
scan all the anchor names, choose the highest, and add one.

Besides: it can be wrong. Suppose you create a document on the NeXT
and save it with NEXTID N=27. Then I edit it by hand and add anchor
names 27, 28, 29, and 30, but I forget to change NEXTID. Then
when you load it back into the NeXT editor, we'll have problems.

82. Do we need a place to put the locking cookie?

Is
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html
the latest info on HTTP2? I don't see how the server gives the
cookie to the client on a CHECKOUT response. If the cookie goes
inside the HTML, then locking is limited to HTML format transfers.

I suspect that in stead, the cookie will be part of the headers
of the response. Then it would be the client's responsibility
to keep the cookie associated with the document content. It
might be handy, though, for the client to be able to tuck the
cookie inside the HTML, if the document is indeed HTML.

Ok. Now we have _some_ semantics to agree on. I agree the list
should be extensible, but until there was some list to start with,
I didn't see sufficient motivation to put it in the spec.

On the REL/TYPE name issue: This brings up issue
73. Link types: we should look at HyTime before we go much further
on this.

The REL/TYPE attribute is very close to the HyTime "anchroles"
attribute. See below for more on issue 73.

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/A.html
83. "The type is expressed by a string for extensibility."
I think it's a NAME, rather than CDATA in the DTD. So it's
not an arbitrary string -- it has to start with a letter etc.

I agree with frowing on anything >4, but supporting up to 9 just
for this one application (concatenate, demote, print) seems like
a bad idea. I don't feel strongly one way or the other, though.

23: OK.

SGML considers omitting the quotes around an attribute value to
be a form of markup minimization. In the HTML DTD, I have turned
off all the minimization features, so ALL ATTRIBUTE VALUES MUST
BE QUOTED, regardless of whether they're CDATA, NAMEs, IDs, etc.

Now we have another issue:
84. Should anchor names by SGML IDs?
They're NMTOKENs in the current DTD. This restricts the syntax
to a string of 34 or fewer name characters. As for semantics,
the SGML parser will uppercase the string before handing it to
the application, but it won't check it for uniqueness.

Making this a NAME attribute would restrict the syntax further
so that it must begin with a letter.

Making this an ID attribute would give it the same syntax as NAME,
but the parser would also verify document-wide uniqueness.

The NMTOKEN approach was descriptive, whereas the ID approach
is somewhat prescriptive: it conflicts with some old HTML. I'm
all for moving to ID, though. I think we should take advantage
of SGML features wherever possible.

Can we do the following in stead of using paragraphs in DL?
<DL>
<DT>large
<DT>big
<DD>Large and big are synonyms.
<DD>They share a definition.
<DD>This is the third paragraph of explanation about big

It appears that the linemode browser generally groks. Thus, let's
not mess with P's in DL's. (P's in UL's are messy enough to leave
out too, I guess.)

I kinda thought LI's in UL's were just like P's in the BODY:
they separate, rather than terminate or begin, items.

But if you prefer/require the added structure, I'm all for it.

What the blurb talks about is exactly what I object to: defining
elements by their formatting. If they have no semantic difference, why
not just have one list element with an advisory WIDTH or COLUMNS
attribute?

In fact, I'd support more structure in these things. I suggest
that a MENU should be exactly a list of anchors -- same with DIR,
while UL is a list of free form text, possibly including anchors.

And the difference between MENU and DIR should not be defined in
terms of a number of characters. I'd explain it by saying that the
items in a DIR are likely to be short, mnemonic names that require
significant context for the user to choose between them, whereas MENU
items should be more verbose and may not require explanation or
context.

I see that you've edited the List document somewhat. It's getting
better, but there are some bugs too. Some sections that look like
they should be PRE are not (see #80).

In http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Lists.html

85. The suggested syntax for COMPACT uses minimization, which has
been turned of in the HTML SGML declaration.

The markup
<DL COMPACT>
could be used if we had SHORTTAG (or maybe this is OMITTAG) yes,
but we don't. It's short for
<DL someattributename="COMPACT">
Some legal alternatives are:
<DL STYLE="COMPACT">
<DL COMPACT="yes">

Geez... you're really dragging your feet whenever it comes to
embracing SGML, aren't you? I think the number 1 issue is conformance,
with ease of documentation secondary. If we come up with a conforming
solution, folks can look at our documentation, SGML books, post to
comp.text.sgml, etc. for clarification.

On the other hand, if we cook up some shortcut (like "Line boundaries
within the text are
rendered as a move to the beginning
of the next line, except for one
immediately following or immediately
preceding a tag" which is not exactly what SGML reports, believe me),
a) folks using SGML compliant software will have to jump through
hoops to support our stuff, and b) our documentation becomes the
only place to look for guidance.

Back to the technical issues...

Newlines are also an issue in A elements. My version of the MidasWWW
browser sometimes displays an extra space in the case of:

some text with an <a
HREF="foo">
anchor</a> in it.

It displays one for the space after "an", and one for the newline,
since it doesn't remember whether it's in a word or not across
elements.

SGMLs would eat the newline after the A start tag. If I changed
libHTML to be in conformance on this issue, that would fix the
MidasWWW bug. I'm beginning to think that the way SGML handles
newlines by default makes some sense. We do need a cogent
explanation, though.

39: OK

Highlighting elements like CODE, SAMP, etc. do not mandate a
particular formatting style. One shop may put SAMP sections
in a fixed width font, where another may just use a sans-serif
font to show the distinciton. Some shops may not make any
typographic distinction at all.

The PRE element is a complete escape from all this. It's an
element that says "here's what it looks like. The semantic
information has already been rendered into formatted text."
So while B, I, and U still have a place, CODE, SAMP, etc.
do not belong.

If you had built sgmls, you could know for sure :-) Yes, it

For the ISO characters, I wanted to use names because I wanted to
treat them as external (i.e. non-SGML text) data entities. Since <, >,
and & have representations without resorting to entity processing,
that's the way I wanted to go. We would have had numeric character
references, handled by the parser, and external data entities, handled
by the application, but no text entities (which are handled by the
parser). It simplified the parser and the parser/application interface.

But since we're going to include ISO characters in the HTML
character set, but I still want to be able use their names,
we'll need to support text entities. As long as we're supporting
text entities, we might as well keep &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;.

Almost done. METHODS is not a comma separated list. The SGML

No, SGML comments can't be nested, but they could "surround a whole
nested stack of SGML elements." I'm prepared to debate the comment
element further, but shall we suffice it to say that it's obsolete?
It's listed as Deprecated in the web. This means it should be
supported by future implementations. I heartily disagree.

The HyTime ilink architectural form has an attribute called "anchrole"
that has almost exactly the same semantics as the HTML anchor TYPE/REL
attribute, except that the HyTime anchrole has one name for each end
of the link, rather than a single name for the relationship between
the two ends. This obviates the need for the REV attribute: just
list the roles in the opposite order.

I'd like to get some HyTime folks to review the WWW data model. I
think we could get Elliot Kimber and/or Steve Newcomb to take a look
by posting to comp.text.sgml. I think that's just what I'll do.

They are allowed, but I don't know that they should be interpreted,
since the new-lines are also significant.  I'd say that they should be
interpreted as ADDITIONAL line feeds; the people who set their code
up otherwise can just fix their html.  Ideally, you'd want to realize
that there's a <P> with every new-line, and if so, ignore one or the
other.  That's not really a legal treatment of SGML, but it should
produce nice results.  Of course it encourages people not to fix
their HTML.

>o What is the significance, if any, of more than one <p> in a row,

It seems to be legal HTML, so I guess you just throw in a totally empty
paragraph.

>o Is '&lt' ('&lt;' without the semicolon) a valid construct?

No.

>o Can raw <'s and >'s be in a <pre> section?

No.

This question is out of the jourisdiction of the SGML standard:
it's a question of how we're going to interpret things and display
them.

But, unlike the normal typeset paragraphs where ignoring a newline
here or there is no big deal, the writers of PRE sections want
some assurance as to what the output will look like.

It's on the todo list. I suggested we ignore <p> within <pre>,
but that looks like a bad idea. So now the current thinking,
I believe, is to render it as a line break. This makes those
man pages that end in <p> _and_ newline double space, but
we'll put the onus on the provider to fix that.

I agree (again: this is not an SGML question, but a WWW question).

Now this is an SGML question, and you're wrong: it's legal.

Again, this is an SGML question, and you're wrong.
<PRE>
Is a < b?
</PRE>
is perfectly valid markup.

I am a latecomer, so forgive me if this is naive or old hat.

Many of the issues that people seem to be grappling with are already
handled by news.

For example, we are talking about caching nodes.  News has highly evolved
caching capabilities -- I mean, caching is what it is all about -- both for 
TCP/IP and UUCP-based links.

Someone mentioned the issue of caching and node names, apparently
node names would have to be rewritten by the cacher or need to be made
machine-independent in some way (?).  Article IDs are guaranteed unique
and are server-independent.  The mechanism for translating article
IDs to filenames is fast and pretty highly evolved.

Oh, ugh, "Supercedes:" doesn't cut it unless the article superceding
the old one replaces its article ID, which would probably be Bad.

Expiration dates can be set with "Expires:", and sites that 
archive certain groups already do special things on "Archive-Name:".

Plus news is already ultra-portable.

Is the brief-connection-per-document approach of HTTP still necessary
when the data is widely replicated?

It would be painful to go reap all the references that
point to expired articles, although if a user traversed to an expired
article, perhaps it could be pulled off of tape or an NNTP superserver 
somewhere.

Clearly the authors of WWW think news is important because WWW has 
nice capabilities for accessing NNTP servers.  What, then, is the 
motivation for HTTP as opposed to, say, using news with HTML article 
bodies?

Nope. Your points are well made. I agree, mostly.

>nice capabilities for accessing NNTP servers.  What, then, is the

I thought NNTP could replace HTTP wholesale too. The irreconcilable
difference between a news article and a WWW node is that a WWW node
is editable. It may change over time. [I don't like this strateby,
bit that's what's in practice.]

Thus you have the question of versions, locking, the "home address"
of a document, etc.

Perhaps we could model WWW nodes as sets of articles -- a thread,
for example, so that each time you edit a node, you generate a
new ID.

The problem then is, what do you use for the name of the thing?
(for linking purposes, that is.)

Besides all that, WWW uses addresses -- article lodators, rather
than article identifiers. A WWW client has no /usr/spool/news
database to consult to get all its stuff. It can look at
ftp sites, gopher hosts, etc.

If URN's ever come to town and all the stuff on all those servers
share a namespace like the usenet message-id namespace, then
we may have a chance to play the game that way.

But in the mean time, there are several factors that motivate HTTP.

I certainly agree HTTP should look a _lot_ like NNTP.

Tony, I'll copy my reply to your query about the INPUT tag specs to www-talk.
We have an old spec for INPUT which was implimented pre web. It will be redone.
There is little agreement on the input tag, except that it will include
attributes for width, name, default, and help.  

With this limited definition, the client can impliment default search keys
and get proper resource for help.

We may create a default text to be used with the comment feature, which
will give all input/var field values in rfc822 style for mail based submission.

At issue are:

- handling typed inputs, including texts.
- applying inputs to search defaults. positional? named? override mech?
- applying inputs to go to defaults?
- getting data from users environment, e.g. users mail address.
- how the fields will be substituted into hrefs within the sgml context. scope?
- saving updated input values in bookmarks?
- communicating variables to activity scripts. (our "do" choice)

We need a mechanism to assign arbitrary attributes to anchores and documents.
These may share name space with input variables and VAR tagged data.

If the INPUT and VAR tags could assign an entity value that we can use as
&name; within hrefs, that would serve us well enough.  But, is that legal sgml?
It will require a second html parse of hrefs when they are selected.

Our expertise with sgml is limited-- we need a quick and dirty way to pass
data to activity scripts.  We are far from being able to make a final
proposal to the web community.  The minimal may be:

Tag	Attributes

INPUT	name, length, default, help
VAR	name, timeout

The default search would positionally concatonate inputs into keyword positions.
Documents containg VAR info would not be cached longer than timeout.

It seems that there is interest in fully interactive hypermedia within the web
context.  All proposals/feedback is welcomed.  Hopefully we can do it together.

Irreconcilable?  There are a few other problems with using NNTP as  
the caching machine, the most basic being that there is no way of  
getting from the news article ID to its archive site.

> Thus you have the question of versions, locking, the "home address"

Suppose we adopt a model of having names/addresses for BOTH the fixed  
article-like version AND for the logical live document.  [The version  
relationships can be expressed nicely with the LINK element and a  
link type in HTML -- do you wnat to move this into HTTP?]

Yes exactly.

> (for linking purposes, that is.)

Well, you can use whichever you mean.  Sometimes I migth want to  
refer to a particular version, sometimes to the live document its  
genericity.

You need a server function to turn a link to an anchor in a specific  
version into an anchor in the live document. 

You need a server function to return a list of available versions of  
a live document. An exaple of this is an FYI which is live and an RFC  
which is dead. At any one time, an FYI is associated with a given  
RFC.  You can quote either. If you quote a paragraph number, then it  
is wise to quote the RFC. If you quote it as a generallt useful  
article to read, then quote the FYI number.

This in only because we haven't got a good nameserver yet.  The Udi  
can become a name when a naming scheme exists.

Yes. When we have an algorithm to dereference a URN.

So do I!  This why in the "Expires:" field for example,  I tries to  
use NNTP terminolgy but worry that we mustn't overload NNTP  
vocabulary with different meanings and so pervert it. We must be  
careful there is no semantic clash.  For example, when a news article  
Expires: then does it mean that the article itself vanishes or just  
the cached copy?  Some new articles really expire (the thingsthey  
talk about happen and have gone) and others are important history but  
still the caches throw them out.

I agree.  There are some snags with nes, though, for the ultimate  
retrieval tool. One trouble is, news caches documents very simply.  
The distribution scheme is a flood broadcast.  This is  OK for real  
news (shortlived articles), although many sites sag under the load of  
a lot of stuff they never read.  There are strict limit on what  
anyone posts because of the incredible worldwide total system load  
and disk space usage per message.  There is no well-defined algorithm  
for picking up archived news.  The message Id of an article is not  
enough: you need to know at least one of its newsgroups, its date,  
and be able to deduce the archibe node name and the organisation of  
the archive.

The conventions of posing FAQ lists and other "periodic postings" are  
in fact an abuse of the prototcol, and would be better served by a  
retrieval protocol rather than a broadcast protocol.

I know that the NNTP WG is looking at this sort of area, and maybe we  
should all get together.

In a nutshell, if you take all the data everywhere available online  
and put it into news, the news system will die. The use of newsgroup  
names and lists negotiated by system managers to control what  
documents are visible and cached where is too crude, too inflexible  
-- it doesn't scale well.  The caching has to be automatic.

All this said, obvioulsy news and retrieval are coming togather,  
which is why we have tried to look for analogies (see previous  
messages to this list) between news articles and grousp to hypertext  
documents and lists at all times.

Don't worry about that.. I think you are referring to a discussion of

Certainly there is a  case for having the "current" version of an  
article and a given "fixed" version of an article each explicitly  
addressable. See  
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/DesignIssues/Versioning.html
and linked things for an old discussion of these issues.

> Expiration dates can be set with "Expires:",

Exactly.  If you read the provisional HTTP2 spec there is
an explicit link to rfc850 under "Expires". (See
/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html#z5)

Really?  Tell me more.  Is that in an RFC somewhere?
reference? Example?

As I said above, the mass of data will not be widely replicated.
You don't want a copy of all the data in the phone book, you just  
want access to it, plus a cache (which you may currently keep in you  
diary).  When you're talking about all the phone book sin the world,  
this is still more the case!

So theer will in the end be a directory system not unlike X.500 which  
will allow you to find who has the nearest copy of a document you  
want, in a fairly sophisticated way. And you will pick up up from  
that place.  Then you will click again and pick up a reference from  
somewhere else.

An important feature of HTTP is that the document is returned with  
the minimum number of round trips. (Sorry for all the people who have  
heard this before).  Conection-oriented protocols like WAIS and NNTP  
have an introductory dialogue which slows down the first fetch by n*  
the distance/speed of light.

We probably need horses for courses -- there is nothing wrong with  
keeping a few protcols around optimised for different access  
profiles.

(BTW I think there is a need for a point-point low bandwidth protocol  
designed for beating the hell out of a phone line. One that will keep  
the phone line occpied in a very inteligent way with look-ahaed  
fetches of related documents and lists or parts of them so that a  
home user with a big disk can explore with optimised ease when he is  
paying by the minute. Another good student project)

I hope I've showed that broadcast data can't cover the NIR world. But  
I also hope that we can allow the models to converge and create a  
supermodel which encompases them.  This is the end goal of HTTP2 or  
should we call it NNTP3.

Reply-To: jackson@stsci.edu

In comparing the features provided by Gopher,

nor Viola WWW provides any search capabilities
within the text displayed.

Thus one is limited to scanning the text.  
For non-hypertext'd information, this is
a severe drawback.

Are there any plans to add this feature or is
it undesirable to do so?

[I'm going over old mail, replying to stuff I missed. I confess I
can't make much of this sketch. But from what I understand...]

I need examples to help me think. Tell me if this example matches
your model:

The client C sends GET foo to server S. S returns:

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Search Template</TITLE>
<QUERYFORM base="medibase">diagnose condition where age is <recall name="age">
and symptoms includes (<if name="headache">headache</if>
<if name="blackouts">blackouts</if>)
</queryform>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
How old are you? <input name="age" type="number"
width="5" help="http:s/help/inputs#age">
<P>
Do you have any of the following symptoms?
<UL>
<li>headach? <input name="headache" type="boolean" width="3">
<li>blackouts? <input name="blackouts" type="boolean" width="3">
</ul>

The client displays the body of the document with a blank
for the age, and check-boxes for the symptoms, and a 
"query" button (similar to a "search" button in response
to <ISINDEX>). The user fills in the blanks and clicks
the query button. Then the client uses the QUERYFORM
to compose its query from the inputs. It sends

GET medibase HTRQ/1.0
Accept: text/plain

diagnose condition where age is 25
 and symptoms includes (blackouts).

to the server. The server performs the query on the medibase
database and returns some document.

Where does the volatile data (<VAR> stuff) come in?

This would require some additions to the DTD:

Inside HEAD, we'd allow QUERYFORM:
<!ELEMENT queryform - - (#PCDATA|recall|if|...)+>
<!ATTLIST queryform
	base CDATA #IMPLIED -- URL to search defaults to current doc --
	>
<!ELEMENT recall - O EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST recall
	name IDREF #required -- points to an input element -->
<!ELEMENT if - O (#PCDATA|if)+>
<!ATTLIST if
	name IDREF #required -- points to input element -->

Then inside BODY, we'd add the INPUT element:

<!ELEMENT input - O EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST input
	NAME ID #REQUIRED
	WIDTH NUMBER #IMPLIED
	DEFAULT CDATA #IMPLIED
	HELP CDATA #IMPLIED -- url of help info --
	>

This would require changes to both the server and the client,
but I don't see any way around that.

It's not a major change to HTML -- just a few more elements.
The way I suggest you associate input variables with things
in the query is through the ID/IDREF mechanism as above.

Does this jive at all with what you're thinking?

DL, UL and OL Lists
-------------------

Can we please avoid too tight a definition:

I support:

    o   DD terms can include <P> breaks

    o   LI terms can include <P> breaks for UL and OL lists

The use of <P> in lists is both natural and easy to implement, and I for one
would find the repeated DD's awkward to deal with as well as screwing up the
natural semantics of a one to one relationship between DT and DD text.

    o   DT terms can be arbitrarily long and are wrapped onto the line below

This occasionally happens, e.g. when people place long anchors as DT terms.
It was also reasonably simple to implement.

It might be an improvement to emulate the approach used by Latex as in:

\begin{description}
    \item[TERMS ARE IN A BIG FONT]
        while their defintions follow in the normal font
        and wrap round with a margin indent.
\end{description}

giving:

  TERMS ARE IN A BIG FONT while their definitions follow in the normal font
    and wrap round with a margin indent.

versus the HTML guidelines which suggest:

  TERMS ARE IN A BIG FONT       while their defintions follow in the normal
                                font and wrap round with a margin indent.

The Latex approach allows terms to be as long as you like, and avoids the
issue of what to do when terms collide with the definition text. Perhaps
the HTML guidelines should leave this issue open ...

I would further like to have the freedom to embed lists, e.g. OL in UL and
vice versa, but allowing only one level of embedding, e.g.

<UL>
    <LI>This is a simple item.
    <LI>While this one requires some amplification:
        <OL>
            <LI>first point
            <LI>second point
            <LI>third point
        </OL>
    <LI>Another simple item
</UL>

My implementation of lists is fairly relaxed whilst being able to support
smooth scrolling of arbitrary length HTML documents. The processing demands
for this require the browser to be able parse backwards - working forwards
from the start of the document each time is MUCH TOO SLOW. This is not a
problem unless there is an HTML feature which forces you to go back
arbitrarily far before you can figure out the state (margins, font, active
tags etc.) from which to work forwards again to your current location.

The awkward features turn out to be:

    a)  ordered lists
    b)  multi-line DT terms

In practice neither of these has caused real problems since actual documents
keep their use to relatively short sections at a time. A way out of my
problems would be to embed state info in the buffer as processing attributes,
so far I have been able to provide good scrolling performance while keeping to
the vanilla text representation of HTML docs.

Cheers for now (the Pub is bekoning)

Dan, I have some further suggestions for <queryform> which would greatly
broaden the opportunities for html interfaces to databases.

Let me know if you want me to see how these additions can be formalised
within your DTD, as I know you are being kept rather busy.

--------------

(in: Dan Connolly Tue, 19 Jan 93 Re: INPUT tag - was: Searching)

    The client C sends GET foo to server S. S returns:

    <HEAD>
      <TITLE>Search Template</TITLE>
      <QUERYFORM base="medibase">diagnose condition where age is
        <recall name="age">and symptoms includes (<if name="headache">

        <LI>blackouts? <input name="blackouts" type="boolean" width="3">
      </UL>

I like the idea, and am glad to see people are now taking an interest in html
and forms. Study of related projects suggests you need several things:

A variety of input fields:

    o   checkbox (boolean)
    o   text field
    o   numeric field (integer and floating point)
    o   radio-button groups
    o   one-from-many menu
    o   n-from-m menu

Summarising what you suggest above:

    <input name=FIELDNAME type=FIELDTYPE [width=FIELDWIDTH] [help=HELPUDI]>

    FIELDNAME is a unique identifier for this form
    FIELDTYPE ::= "boolean" | "text" | "integer" | "float"

    The [ ] brackets denote optional attributes.
    
The width can be optional, since the browser can support sideways scrolling
of the input field when the entry exceeds the current display width.

Multiple choice items need a richer structure, e.g.

    <select name=FIELDNAME type=CHOICETYPE [value=VALUE] [help=HELPUDI]>
        <choice>item 1
        <choice>item 2
        <choice>item 3
    </select>

    CHOICETYPE ::= "radio" | "single" | "multiple"

The choice initially shown is given by the value attribute for the <select>
token, defaulting to the first choice. The value returned is the item text
unless a "value" attribute is defined for that <choice>.

    <choice value=VALUETEXT>

I think that <a> tags should be permissible for <choice> text so that you can
provide further explanations upon request for each choice. If there isn't a
value attribute then the displayable text for the anchor would form part of
that choice in the obvious manner.

It is also useful to distinguish form decorations from output fields. I think
this can be adequately handled using the existing emphasis tags though.

How will the <queryform> tag take over from the <ISINDEX> mechanism? Right
now, the browser provides an input field and search button, but I assume that
in future, searchable documents will use the queryform approach instead.

Forms generally involve additional ideas:

    a)  expressions and queries for output fields

    b)  edits (constraints) on input field values

    c)  dependencies between fields

These can all be handled by the server, albeit with a performance penalty as
perceived by the user.

It is important to be able to show the current values as currently being in
error (along with an explanation). For example you could have a form for
configuring a computer system, which gives you choices for the number of hard
and soft drives:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       *  Fixed Drive(s): [2 x 512 Gb disk]
       *  Soft Drive(s):  [1 x 1.44 Mb 3.5" floppy]

   (*) Error: you are only allowed a combined total of 2 fixed and soft drives
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So we need to provide attributes to:

    a)  signify that the current choice is in error in some way
    b)  that a given choice is not currently permissible (grayed out)

This can be done with two attributes (both default to "yes"):

    ok="yes" | "no"             ;;  for <input> and <select>
    enabled="yes" | "no"        ;;  for <choice>

I don't like this as it is very much at variance with what DL has  
meant up till now.  The tags came from an IBM DTD which shares them I  
thought with eth AAP DTD. I think we should leave them be, as they  
were originally designed allowing pairs of <dt> <dd> but <p> within  
the <DD>. I must admit the NeXT browser can only produce a void  
"term" to make a new paragraph at the moment.

From dave's message:
| I support:
| 

|     o   DD terms can include <P> breaks
| 

|     o   LI terms can include <P> breaks for UL and OL lists

I agree

|     o   DT terms can be arbitrarily long and are wrapped onto the  
line below

You have to allow anything (almost) to be arbitrarily long as things  
will be egnerated automatically from other things, and arbitrary  
limits are then a pain.

Whoa! You mean there's a round trip every time the user enters a field?
This implies a stateful connection between the client and server.

This isn't the model I had in mind at all! I thought it went:
	* server sends whole form
	* user interacts with client only to fill out form
	* user instructs client to send completed form to server
	* client translates user inputs using <QUERYFORM> element
	  and sends results to server in HTRQ data
	* server processes query.

Oops! crossed wires - I intended just what you say above. The performance
penalty as perceived by the user comes from having to send the complete form
to find out that s/he has mistyped one of the fields.

A smarter/more sophistocated system would include scripts as part of the
queryform document, which apply the constraints locally WITHOUT any network
delays.

BUT that seems too complex for us to put in HTML for now!

Note that work at ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) on
hypermedia/multimedia standards for ISDN sees scripts as an essential element
for multimedia, and smart documents. Their work is being driven by the
European telecomms companies plus a few multimedia specialist companies, and
seems obsessed with videotex, and complex ISO multilayed standards.

Mail me if you are interested in references to this work.

Best wishes,

Sounds fine to me. By the way, can you explain the status of the HTML
registration with IANA, e.g. does it include Dan's new emphasis tags or not?
Where will the queryform tags go - into HRML or HTML2?

By the way I am trying to cross-compile my X11/Xlib browser for Windows 3.1 on
the PC. I have found a package which gives you TCP/IP for Windows, but the
catch is they (Distinct of Saratoga CA) want royalties for run-time licenses!

Do you know of any alternative s/w for TCP/IP for Windows which has a free
run-time license, so that we could distribute the browser as freeware?

Some confusion seems in evidence here. My browser currently just stores the
plain text of the HTML document with no extra info. I have the following
program structure:

    DisplayDoc()
        ParseHTML()
            GetToken()
                { GetLiteral() or GetWord() }

    DisplayDoc()
       Refreshes screen for current document type and contents

    ParseHTML()
      This procedure performs one of 4 functions, depending on mode parameter

        EITHER work forwards until current line intersects the top of the
        window and update sgml state variables in the process. (mode=FORWARDS)

        OR work forwards until the current line includes the desired anchor
        and update sgml state variables in the process. (mode=SEARCH)

        OR work forards until a specified part of the buffer,
        but NOT updating the sgml vars  (mode=HEIGHT)

        OR display the formatted text in the window, but leave state vars
        unchanged (mode=DISPLAY)

      The sgml parser is the same for all these functions and shares the
      same code to reduce problems in maintaining muliples copies of the
      same basic algorithm.

      It would be desirable to have a general sgml parser, supplemented by
      the process rules for word wrap, and line breaks etc. For now, I have
      hard-coded the HTML subset and procedural interpretation.

    DeltaHTMLPosition(long h) -- used by scrolling mechanism
       Find the text line which intersects/starts from the top of the window
       Note that h is the new pixel offset for the top of the window itself,
       for which the current value is PixelOffset+nClipped.

       This procedure is really tricky when the new position is above the
       current one. The simple approach would always work forwards from
       the start of the document, but this would be real slow for scrolling
       around near the end of long documents. The approach taken here
       attempts to work locally in the document working backwards looking for
       cues to discover line break decisions and state changes, then parsing
       forwards in the normal manner to get to the current point, giving you
       the relative offset. You now change the current poition to the earlier
       point, and repeat until you have climbed back up to the desired point.
       Works a treat!

    GetToken()
       Reads an html token including newlines and words

    GetLiteral()
       Used in verbatim modes (e.g. PRE), treats text lines as single words

    GetWord()
       Used to non-verbatim mode to recognise html tags, newlines and words
       dealing as appropriate with character references

Any comments?

Cc: Dave_Raggett <dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com>, www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch

A few unrelated points about this.

A. There is a whole standard, as yukky as SGML, on Electronic data  
Intercahnge, meaning forms and form submission.  I know no more
except it looks like fortran backwards with no spaces.
But it might be interesting for a set of featuire to be supported.

B. I see a need for the definition os two things, a form to be filled  
out 9containing field types and constraints), and a format for the  
return of the field values. The latter is a structure of typed values  
(parameters) plus a note of the method to be applied and the object  
to which it is to be appllied. (I can see several different forms  
providing the same structure, for example a simpler form with a lkot  
of default values, and a separate one in French, all targetted at the  
same object).

I don't think the form should contain a macro for generting a query  
in an arbitrary language. That is too open-ended a function. I think  
the server should be responsible for taking a structure of field  
values and applying it to an object.

I'd like to see this generalised. In HTTP2, an object may allow a  
large set of operations. For each operations, one ought to be able to  
retrieve a form for filling out the parameters. The guts of this form  
should be no less than a complete parameter definition for the  
method. Of couse a general method returns a structure of results as  
well (rather than always a document).

I  see the following scenario:

1.	user follows a link to an object, a flight description, say
2.	The flight object has in its HTTP2 Allowed: field the
	Method RESERVE. The client program doesn't understand this
	but sticks it in the menu.
3.	The users wants to reserve a seat, and pulls down "RESERVE"
	from the menu.
4.	The client asks the server for a [set of] form[s] for which
	describe the parameters to the RESERVE method. The user may
	have to pick one.
5.	The user fills in the form.  The methodname RESERVE and the
	uri of the object he is operating on are supplied by the
	client software.
6.	Parameters (structure of field contents) , methodname and
	object uri are sent off to the server.
7.	A document is returned with the results.

The important thing is that we bridge the gap between automatic and  
manual procedures. Obviously, the user will soon be making local  
macros to reserve sets of flights for himself and his friends. So the  
guts of what goes on must be machine-understandable, not just  
human-readable.

Currently HTTP2 returns a MIME document. A MIME document can be a set  
of objects each with a Content-Type,  but it is kinda heavy for an  
array of 3 integers!  At this point, ASN/1 would seem a better bet (a  
rare thing! ;-) Perhaps we can look at a multipart message and a data  
structure in the same way with generality.

[A problem with including a more compact representation as part of a  
MIME document is that MIME doesn't like encoding techniques to be  
applied which hide the internal types from a MIME gateway. Therefore,  
one might just have to say there was a black box MIME object like

	Content-Type: application/ASN-1
	Content-encoding: base64

Of course ASN/1 like SGML requires a reference to the DTD equivalent
for the (numeric in this case) tag values.  What a plethora of choice  
we have with SGML, ASN/1, RCC822... Perhaps we can write  
architectural forms for DTDs which produce ASN/1-equivalent  
definitions, which will then allow the DTD to define the ASN/1 and  
ASN/1 to become a natural alternative syntax for any conforming DTD.
[It could (is?) done now, but the architectural forms would allow a  
field which is in fact an integer to be sent as an ASn/1 integer  
rather than as a bit of text]

In fact of course the form itself in fact contains a specification of  
the type of the field value structure, so from the form one can  
generate the DTD and/or ASN/1 description for the reply ... silly me.
In fact one can imagine the output data coming in the same way, as a  
set of field values plus a set of forms which would allow its display  
in various languages etc.  The specification of a method required  
just giving the URIs of the infput and output forms.

At any rate, I think it is important to differentiate the set of  
values from the form.

<li>headach? <input name="headache" type="boolean" width="3" default="No">
<li>blackouts? <input name="blackouts" type="boolean" width="3" default="No">
</UL>

Click here to search</a>
------------------end example-
I think you did something similar...  Note that the search could would be
the same as the anchor in the example above.  In this case the search engine
would have to know about the keyword order meaning, but it would work with
http1 systems without "too" much work in existing browsers.

The only connection between <input> and <var></var> is that the name attribute
in each would define a value in the browsers context.  In the first iteration
we won't support the name attribute in either, we will simply use the whole
list of input values in search and do.  Later it will be important to mantain
the users namespace.

Subject: Re:  EDI for forms?

The last time I looked, EDI included BOTH SGML and ASN equivalent definitions.
It may be worthwhile to borrow some things from there, but I stopped following
the standards development there because it got too too too complicated (rich?).

The beauty of HTML is it's simplicity/ease of use.  I hope we keep it that
way.  Although a number of standards have addressed forms, I do not know
of any using SGML to define interactive interfaces as we are attempting.  We
are not concerned with how the form looks, so much, the client should have
freedom in that respect.  Our initial problem, defining input fields, may
benifit most from looking at GUI development tools and translating to SGML.

Sorry, I couldn't find the ISO numbers for EDI, it's been a while...

p.s.  Shouldn't HTML2 include HyTime links?  HTML's relative references in 
anchors are much nicer than HyTime markups, but HyTime seems like the
natrual markup extension for full multi-media.  This seems to countradict
my plee to keep HTML simple, but one could always invoke a HyTime client
to follow a HyTime link.

From: Dan Connolly <connolly@pixel.convex.com>

--cut-here

HTML was designed to be simple. Folks are supposed to be
able to whack out HTML with a text editor -- no rocket
science required.

Also, you ought to be able to use MS/Word or the equivalent
to write your documents or to view HTML documents.

But it's also designed to be processed by machine -- lots
of machines all over the planet.

Enter SGML.

It seemed like the natural choice, so Tim implemented an
informal SGML parser in his WWW clients.

Nobody really knew the ins and outs of SGML, so information
providers who wanted to produce HTML automatically just
checked to be sure the public www client grokked.

Then other folks tried to write HTML parsers. We discovered
that there were a lot of issues that were not covered by
any spec other than the WWW source code.

Then I tried to use the sgmls parser to develop an HTML
to FrameMaker tool. I discovered that the WWW source code
conflicted with the SGML standard. Uh oh!

By now I think we all agree that we should actually use SGML
to specify the syntax and structure of HTML.

But I wonder: on whom rests the responsibility for validating
HTML documents? This is really an HTTP issue: is it part
of the protocol that the data stream is _valid_ HTML? Or
is it the client's responsibility to deal with errors?

I suggest that it should be the responsibility of the _server_
to produce valid HTML. Of course the client should be robust
in the face of errors. But I suggest that when a client and
a server differ on their interpretation of a document, the
client is at fault if the document is valid, and the server
is at fault if the document is not.

It's too late to introduce this scenario into HTTP v0.9. But
future servers should have the burden of producing valid documents.
This will add complexity to the server code: it can no longer
just grab the contents of any old .html file and ship it
out the port. But it could, for example, fix the markup errors
on the fly and write error messages to a log file.

If a server knows the structure of the document it sends,
it should be able to send the document using SGML, ASN/1,
MIME, or whatever transport mechanism we chose. This is the
real value of standardizing on SGML: the syntax is one
thing, but we don't even have to use it! We have a DTD
that tells, in a more abstract way, what the content of
the document is.

With that in mind, I suggest we make HTML2 more prescriptive
than HTML. It should match the way documents are structured
and processed more than the way they are typed in a text editor.

For example, the following document is legal, but it's a pain
to process:

--cut-here
Content-Type: text/x-html

<html>
Here's the first paragraph. It's at the out structural level.<P>

The is the <em>Second</em> paragraph.
<body>
Here's another paragraph.
<H1>Another one</h1>
The last paragraph.
</body>
</html>

--cut-here

Imagine you want to parse that document and answer queries
like: "show me the second paragraph of the document."

HTML isn't supposed to be too sophisticated, but it _is_
supposed to model typical word-processor documents fairly
well. A paragraph is a pretty fundamental chunk of information.
The definition of a paragraph in HTML is much more complex
than it need be.

Consider the following representation of essentially
the same document:

--cut-here
Content-Type: text/x-html

<html>
 <body>
  <A>Here's the first paragraph.</A>
  <a>The is the <em>Second</em> paragraph.</a>
  <a>Here's another paragraph.</a>
  <H1>Another one</h1>
  <a>The last paragraph.</a>
 </body>
</html>

--cut-here

The the elements that make up the content of the BODY are
all paragraphs. Wouldn't it be a lot easier to write
a formatter for the latter type of document?

The original HTML design was motivated by conventional use
of SGML, with shortrefs and other markup minimization features
to aid keyboarding of documents.

But Tim (wisely) didn't want to put those features in his
parser, so we ended up with a compromise: it's fairly
easy to keyboard, but it has virtually no structure.

so...

I suggest that future versions of HTML should have more structure.

How much structure? Enough. Enough to model whatever kinds of
document make a WWW node. About as much as a TeXinfo node, which
is pretty similar to a FrameMaker TextFlow, or a MS/Word section.
We should probably also model typical markup conventions of internet
mail and USENET news.

Then... the big step: hytime. I _really_ think we should look at
hytime architectural forms to model things like threads, webs,
hierarchies of documents, etc.

I think we could use HyTime mechanisms to form an abstraction
that models the structure of unix filesystems, message threads,
and other typical hypertext organizations on the internet.

This is how we should model "relative links." The unix ../../foo
syntax is fine as a model. But we should abstract the features from
that syntax, so that we can use the same model on VMS systems without
ad-hockery.

That syntax happens to work for most gopher holes too,
but that's cheating: the gopher "path" string is supposed to be opaque.
The URL spec says something about how servers that use hierarchical
databases should use the unix path syntax. [What a load of hooey!
Oh... Ahem... sorry.]

And the syntax of most WAIS URLs' has _two_ unix paths in it. What
do you do with that?

I really think HyTime links and locs are a good way to model all this.
The connection between HyTime and SGML is incidental. The only reason
to use SGML markup is to _interchange_ information between HyTime
applications (...or to talk about HyTime constructs in email, or any
of the other things that text is convenient for.)

Standardizing HTML was one thing: it's only used in the WWW community.
But standardizing the WWW addressing architecture is a much larger
venture. I hope eventually the various IETF groups etc. will realize
that the HyTime community has thought about formal mechanisms to
name and reference information a lot, and the product of their labors,
HyTime, may have some technical merit as well as the weight [and
overhead...] of an international standard.

Dan

p.s. I thought I subscribed to the cni-arch mailing list where URL
stuff was supposed to happen. I don't remember getting anything from
that list for a long time. Is there any URL discussion going on?

See:

There's a lot of work left to be done, but the architecture
I've come up with looks quite workable. For example, you can
do and of these with the same basic mechanism:

% sgml_test HTML MIF <some_html_file >mif_equivalent

% sgml_test plaintext HTML <any_old_file >html_equivalent

% sgml_test plaintext MIF <any_old_file >mif_equivalent

I gotta go. It's a rush job, but I'd like folks to get a look
at the HMDoc architecture.


Besides... HTML to MIF is handy!
(and plaintext to HTML might be handy for servers...)

Subject: NCSA X Mosaic 0.5 released
X-Md4-Signature: 73d08d8c8e9930840fefb9989bfe91ac

By the power vested in me by nobody in particular, alpha/beta version
0.5 of NCSA's Motif-based networked information systems and World Wide
Web browser, X Mosaic, is hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/xmosaic-0.5.tar.Z

This release of X Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).

Binaries for these platforms are available on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in
/Web/xmosaic/binaries-0.5.  More binaries will be supplied as I am
able to find other Motif-configured platforms to use (DEC MIPS
probably within the next half hour).

Although this is alpha/beta software, I'm looking more for feedback on
design and functionality than bug reports right now -- down the road
the bulk of the program will be rewritten in C++ anyway, so don't take
the current code too seriously.  But bug reports are welcome too.  New
releases will probably come out about every 7-14 days until 1.0
arrives.

A list of current and future capabilities of X Mosaic follows this
message.

Cheers,
Marc

Are the mnemonic representations of ISO Latin 1 characters (e.g. in
the subject or in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Connolly/930106/ISOlat1.html)
really necessary for HTML?

As far as I can see, the question translates to 'Is there anyone who's
going to be typing in these things by hand that can't type the numeric
references instead?' and 'Aren't HTML editors going to be used to
produce documents with these characters anyway, and can't editors use
the numeric representation just as easy as the mnemonic
representation?'

Hmmmm.   Yes, I agree in principle but then maybe we should send  
stuff more compactly in ASN/1.  There are advantages to having it  
readable, or writable, by people but I see your point.

Is it difficult to put in?  Like any reason for leving the option  
out?

Marc,

Brilliant!  I have copied into the bin areas on our local workstation  
support server, and will advertise it here.  Having the thing  
self-contained in one file makes life a lot easier.

I have put copies of your files on:

ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/sun4/xmosaic_0.5.Z
ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/decstation/xmosaic_0.5.Z
ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/rs6000/xmosaic_0.5.Z
ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/sgi/xmosaic_0.5.Z
ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/xmosaic_0.5.tar.Z

for anyone who is closer to CERN than NCSA.

I append a few detailed comments on the program.

	Tim
__________________________________________________________________
Xmosaic has a lot of practical things which real uses want -- like  
mail and print and a bookmarks and stuff. Well done!

I like the quick change fonts, too, and the option of single or  
multiple window operating mode.

That said, it would also be nice to customise it easily (yes, I want  
to have my cake and eat it!).  So the ability to set the home page up  
system-wide with some sort of a .xmosaicrc file would be useful.
We'll have to make a covering script to fix 


I have a feeling that a menu option which sets the current document  
home (persistently) by writing out a ~/xxx.rc file is probably an  
easy way for users in arbitrary places to find out where to start.
"Set home here" or something.

From the system manager's point of view, a system-wide .rc would  
allow the home page to bet set up site wide without anyone having  
know about environment variables.  For one thing, easy though it is  
to pick CERN out from the document menu, when NCS is difficult to  
reach, one doesn't want the program to hang.  It migth also be useful  
to set a pointer to the root of a copy of your help tree.

In practice, of course, a full app defaults will probably be needed  
to cater for all tastes. If you are interested in my personal tastes,

- Local "experts" believe that non-serif fonts for titles and serifed  
fonts for the rest are easiest to read on paper at leat. Helvetica  
for headings and New century for text would appease some of the  
locals.

- The colours: I like having a distinctive colour for "internals"  
like UDIs and source --- but white on light grey is a little  
difficult for me to read.... perhaps a darker grey?
Similarly I would prefer the overall text contrast to be higher and  
the anchors a different color with less contrast.


Other little things ...

Search text prompt always available: should be greyed out onluess  
ISINDEX.  If document is searchable and not editable, this field  
should come up selected when the window is loaded, so i can just go  
ahead and type and hit return.

I got a crash when I mimimised the main window, brought it back up  
and then did a "reload". The error message was:-


asis01% X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window  
parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  2 (X_ChangeWindowAttributes)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  0
  Resource id in failed request:  0x4c000e7
  Serial number of failed request:  26455
  Current serial number in output stream:  26689

This was running on a sun and displaying on HP.

I load a document and the free-format text disappears under the  
right-hand margin. I fiddle with the window size, returning it to  
what it was, and teh text flows nicely to fit.  Would have been good  
if it could have got it right first time.

I think you know about:

- Anchors which have no HREFs should not be highlighted
- Jump to anchor withing document doesn't work

Every new browser is sexier than the last.  There is a lot of  
cross-fertilisation going on, which is very good. KUTGW everyone...

Definitely. I haven't built it yet, but bookmarks are a MUST! I use
xgopher a lot in stead of midasWWW cuz with midsaWWW, I have to
edit my home page by hand to add bookmarks.


But Tim: about this user preferences stuff. I disagree with your

X application should use the X resource database to get user
preferences. Folks can build their X resource database from
system-wide app-defaults files, files in their home directory,
environment variables, command-line-args, etc.

Works good.

I've seen you write a couple times about having a user preference
system that worked the same on the NeXT, Mac, X boxes, etc.

Making them look the same from an API would be great.

But don't make users adapt to a new WWW scheme for doing user preferences.
NeXT folks should use the NeXT user preference database, just like all
they do for their other tools. Mac folks should find "Preferences..."
under the edit menu. X folks know how to muck with .Xdefaults and xrdb.
(though a friendlier UI to the x resource database is badly needed).

The unix dot-files scheme is passe, I think -- especially for distributed
applications. Don't require folks to use it. For example, with the
X resource database, I can load resources off host A into my X server,
then run midasWWW on host B and it will see my preferences.

Subject: New release of unix server for WWW "httpd"
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch



The 0.9b release of the basic WWW daemon (httpd) contains a few bug  
fixes, and the ability to browse directories.  Note that the 0.9a  
release was buggy and should not be used (Thanks to Jon Streets/FNAL  
and Peter Lister/Cranfield for pointing this out.)

The new release is available by anonymous FTP as usual on
host info.cern.ch, in /pub/www/src/WWDaemon_0.9b.tar.Z.
You also need /pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_1.0a.tar.Z.

New in this release:

 -	Directory browse: if a directory name is given,
 	it is returned as hypertext.  This is opional: it can
	be always enabled, always diabled, or enabled
	only for directories containing a file
	named ".www_browsable".
 

 -	README inclusion:  When a directory contains a
 	README file, the file may be included either linked
	to the list with all the other files, or may have its
	text embedded before or after the list.
	
By using these features, a WWW server can be set up to serve
existing trees containing for example plain text files with
very little effort.

The online documentation gives the new command line options
-dy -dn -ds -db -dt and -dr which control the directory browsing.

(The server has been tested on the NeXT.  Any bugs to me ASAP
please!)

	Tim Berners-Lee

How is it best to add a simple search facility to a httpd server?
Or, better put, if a user wends hir way into one of my html menus,
is there a simple addition I can make that will add a search capability?
What I'd like is something like:

<dl>
<dt><a name=dub href="dubliners.html">Dubliners<dd>by James Joyce
<dt><a name=ulysses href="ulysses.html">Ulysses<dd>by James Joyce
[etc]
<dt><a name=something href=somepointer>Search<dd>the above texts for
a name or keyword
</dl>

Can a href point to a script or binary which will pipe its output back
to httpd and return the user to the same menu? Can that script be as
simple as, say, "grep '$1' * >somewhere" ? Or (as we're using PAT),
something like "pat something; $1 >somewhere" and get httpd to pass
the contents of the "name" aatribute into the "something" argument?
Or do I need another piece of already-httpd-enmeshed software? What
are people using for the Bible search that is available thru WWW?

This is supported functionality. See the user guide:
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Guide.html

I just wanted to take the opportunity to point out once again
that the <ISINDEX> strategy for marking up searchable documents
is less than optimal.

Inline "search this anchor" elements are preferable, at least
to me.

This request shows that it's intuitive to at least one other person:
he just made a guess and picked the inline searchable-anchors
strategy:

>What I'd like is something like:

Not as simple as you'd like, I suspect.  The httpd daemon doesn't  
support a search directly.  What you can do is (hack httpd or) run  
another daemon which is completely written in sh or csh or perl (pick  
your favorite).  There are some examples on the web. Then you have
something like

  <dt><a name=something
 href="http://curia.ucc.ie:9000/keywordsearchsearch/joyce">
 Search<dd>the above texts for a name or keyword

When the user follows the link, the special server  on
port 9000 gets a
	GET /keywordsearchsearch/joyce
request, and returns a search panel document:

  <head>
    <isindex>
  </head>
  <body>
  Give keywords, or words from the title, to find books
  by James Joyce which match all keywords given.
  </body>

The <isindex> flag tells the www program that the document is a  
search panel and enables the FIND command. (On smarter browers it
enables the search text input field.)

When the user types a keyword, that same special server gets a
different request:

	GET /keywordsearch/joyce?portrait+young

Your script reads that from stdin and must write the result back to
stdout. Like

	#! /bin/csh
	request = ( `echo "$<" ) 

	'echo request[2] | sed -f request.sed ' | sed -f reply.sed
	
where request.sed is something like 

	s|^\([^/]*\)/\([^?]*\)?\(.*\)| pat -\1 -cat \2 \3|g
	s|+| |g

(I no nothing of pat, so that is all made up. Notice I used parts of  
the address of the serach panel to specify options to pat)  The  
output is formatted into a hypertext file, in the example by  
reply.sed
which has to generate a hypertext document with a valid reference
to the found documents with their addresses on your original
httpd server.

Which all is in fact simpler than it looks -- largely because the
thibng is just a program runnng from stdin to stdout which you
can test on a terminal.  When you run it under inetd (just like
httpd is run, but on port 9000) it is inetd which takes care of
attaching stdin and stdout to the client.

As pat sounds like a serious peice of retrieval machinery, it
would certainly be worth wrapping it up as a W3 server to make it
available on the web.

A couple of hints:  1. Put lots of parameters into the address
of the serach panels so that you can put pointers to all kinds
of different pat features if you needs them
2. In the search panel document which your port 9000 server script
generates, put a pointer to related serach panels, help pages etc.

>  </dl>

This is basically what I have described.  When the guy follws the  
link, he gets back a micro-document which tells him about the search
he can do.  This is the WWW model. The Gopher model, which Dan  
Connolly prefers, is that he should immediately get prompted for
keywords with a default search panel. I'll discuss that in a separate  
message.

Addendum:

Od course, if you hack the C code of httpd, then you can
make the original document immeditaly searchable:

<isindex>
<dl>
<dt><a name=dub href="dubliners.html">Dubliners<dd>by James Joyce
<dt><a name=ulysses href="ulysses.html">Ulysses<dd>by James Joyce
[etc]
<dt>You can give keywords to search the above texts.
</dl>

This involves no extra panels for the user, but involves the
httpd daemon being able to handle a request

	GET /document/list?portrait+of+the+artist

The place to sneak it in is in HTRetrieve.c, when the
"keywords" parameter to HTRetrieve(soc,doc,keywords) is not NULL.
The keywords parameter is a space-separated string.
(I talk of version 0.9b at least)

It is of course safer to have compiled servers than shell scripts
from the security point of view.  Keep any servers, scripts or
compiled, root-owned and writable only by root!

OK, Dan, I see you aren't going to give up on this one :-).  As
we want to be able to map Gopher modes effectively too, how about
using a link type:


<dl>
<dt><a name=dub href="dubliners.html">Dubliners<dd>by James Joyce
<dt><a name=ulysses href="ulysses.html">Ulysses<dd>by James Joyce

The "SEARCH" relationship is a presentation instruction a bit like  
"EMBED" or "PRESENT".  It means, "Don't just jump to this, search it  
immediately".   A nice thing about it is that if the browser doesn't
understand it, then it will still work, just not be presented in the
way the author had intended.

What do you think?

Flattery like this will get you a long way :-)

By "search this anchor" do you mean "search from here onwards to EOF"
or are you implying that the file should be marked up as <a name=anchor>
lots and lots of text, megabytes even, to which the user might want to
restrict the search</a> ?

Absolutely.  I didn't mean to advocate a and actual .rc file,
I totally agree that the mechanism should be the natural local one  
one in each environment. Like look and feel should also always be  
local.

Ooops. My mistake. I got httpd confused with gopherd.
I don't think httpd supports searches after all.

From: "Peter Lister, Cranfield Computer Centre" <ccprl@xdm001.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk>

We have hypertext info in Microsoft RTF format, and my boss wants it
available on Unix... Her plan is to run Soft PC on our workstations,
which will be expensive and slow, but most of all inelegant.

I see placeholders in the httpd code for RTF, and documentation on the
web saying that this is being considered, but how long is it likely to
be before I can feed RTF to the web? Is anyone actively working on
this? If so, would you like an alpha/beta test site? If not, where can
I get an RTF format definition, so that I can have a go myself?

I have been, but I don't expect to be able to do much more work
on it.

> If so, would you like an alpha/beta test site? If not, where can

I wrote a Motif widget for displaying RTF stuff -- it probably
doesn't directly support the hypertext conventions you used in
your RTF documents, but you should be able to fix it somehow.

Most of the RTF parsing code was written by Paul DuBois. Ask
archie about the RTFstuff package.

Here's the source distribution for my widget:

--cut-here
Content-Type: message/external-body;
	access-type=ANON-FTP;
	site="export.lcs.mit.edu";
	directory="contrib";
	name="XcRichText-1.5.tar.Z";

Content-Type: application/x-tarZ; name="XcRichText-1.5.tar.Z"

--cut-here

As for RTF and WWW:

I'm working on an architecture for dealing with HTML documents
in various formats. There's a base HMDoc class, whose essential
methods are startTag, data, and endTag. I've written two parsers:

SGML_parseInstance -- parses an SGML instance, and calls the HMDoc's
	startTag, data, and endTag methods as the info is parsed.
Plaintext_parse -- parses plain text files. Calls the HMDoc's
	startTag method to start a PRE element, then calls the data
	method repeatedly to load the data, then calls the endTag
	method.

And I'ver written three HMDoc subclasses:

InCore -- builds a data structure to store all the information from
	the tags and data. You can call it's traverse method, and
	it will traverse the data structure and pass all the tags
	and data to another HMDoc.
HTMLwriter -- responds to startTag, endTag methods by writing SGML
	markup to a stream. Responds to data method by writing it
	to a stream, representing <, >, and & as character references.
MIFwriter -- responds to methods by writing a MIF representation
	of the document to a stream.

So, for example, you can use SGML_parseInstance to read an HTML
document into an InCore HMDoc, then use the InCore traverse method
to pass the data to a MIFwriter to write it in MIF format.
Or you could use Plaintext_parse and give it a MIFwriter, and convert
straight from plain text to MIF witout ever storing the document
in memory.

These modules are designed to drop into existing clients. For
example, the xmosaic client has a Save As... dialog box with
several format options. All you need to do is map the
format options to HMDoc subclasses. Then traverse the document,
calling the HMDoc's tag and data methods, and it will write
the document in the appropriate format.

The GridText module from the linemode browser could be turned
into another HMDoc subclass.

Also, it should be easy to write LaTeXwriter or RTFwriter subclasses.

To support reading RTF documents, I'd start with Paul Dubois'
RTF parsing stuff, and make it into a routine like SGML_parseInstance.
The routine would have to recognize the RTF equivalent of start
tags, end tags, and data.

If your RTF files have paragraph tags that match the HTML tags,
it's easy. If, on the other hand, your RTF files were written
without HTML in mind, you've got a more difficult task on your
hand.

You have two options: 1) try to zen some HTML structure out of the
info in the RTF file, or 2) treat the RTF file essentially as
a graphic, and use something like my RTF widget to display it.

Option 2 doesn't allow you to integrate hypertext in your RTF
documents with WWW, but it may be the easiest way to go.

Subject: X Mosaic 0.5 status report
X-Md4-Signature: 30a400cd060bcfb0e018f471a7915c89

Some people are having trouble running X Mosaic 0.5 on Suns running
X11R5.  The problem is apparently that we accidentally dynamically
linked in the X libraries but statically linked the Motif library, so
if you're running R5 on a Sun the Motif library is apparently being
thrown for a loop when it gets hooked up with the R5 libraries and
isn't expecting it.  In the future, all Sun X libraries will be
statically linked.

In the meantime, downgrade your Suns to X11R4 :-).

0.6 oughta be out real soon now; a list of things changed as of this
moment follows...

History window now shows both 'where you've been' and
  'where you can go'.
Previously visited nodes are colored differently, a la Midaswww;
  this global history is automatically persistent across sessions.
New resources for customization, including:
  Show URLs instead of Document Titles.
  Customize window per document feature.
  Optionally have pointer and focus warp to keyword entry field
    when you reach a searchable node.
  Optionally turn off global history mechanism.
Button2 can now activate anchors; forces a new window
  to open (as with Window Per Document feature).
Going from a document necessarily wider than the window
  (e.g. preformatted text) to a normal document will now
  get rid of the horizontal spacebar and reformat properly.
Addition of Whine option under Help.
Addition of Go To and Go To Local options under Navigate.
<listing> is now recognized.
Numeric character references (e.g. &#60;) are now handled.
Anchors without href's aren't colored anymore.
Memory leak in document reformatting nailed.
Layout glitches fixed.
Better help.
Other misc bugfixes and cleanups.

Cheers,
Marc

Looks to me like this (the un-escaped '<') is the fault of the
WWW/WAIS gateway?  I've tested this with the linemode browser,
Violawww, and Midaswww and all of them choke too -- and quite
reasonably, I'd say.  (Although, Dan, I haven't tried libHTML on this

Absolutely. The HREF isn't quoted, and the < in <and needs to

Fellow WWW'ers,

If all goes as planned, X Mosaic will be expanded in the
not-too-distant future to be able to handle heterogeneous MIME
documents.  This capability will probably take the form of a MIME
"master widget" that will create child widgets to display various data
elements -- text, GIF images, JPEG images, MPEG movies, and so on.
The child widgets will in turn be able to have active elements of
their own...  a widget represent audio/basic will have a 'play'
button, a readout giving the duration of the audio clip, and so on.
Widgets representing unknown types will have controls to allow saving
the data to a local file or possibly passing it to an external
program.

So, we're going to need widgets to display as many different common
datatypes as possible -- for example, we plan to use Dan Connolly's
RTF widget for RTF data elements -- and we'd like to solicit pointers
to or donations of widgets that can display common data formats.  (Of
course, we're distributing full source for X Mosaic and its respective
parts every step of the way.)

The more widgets we don't have to write ourselves, the faster we can
get multimedia X Mosaic out the door and the more capabilities it can
have... so pointers or donations will be most appreciated.

Subject: NCSA X Mosaic 0.6 released
X-Md4-Signature: 1fa066f10f5c445903b4082e69c821f8

Shazam and kaboom -- alpha/beta version 0.6 of NCSA's Motif-based
networked information systems and World Wide Web browser, X Mosaic, is
hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/xmosaic-0.6.tar.Z

This release of X Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).

Binaries for these platforms (and DEC Ultrix) are available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/binaries-0.6

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working binaries
are welcome.)  The 0.6 Sun binary should work on systems running X11R5
(unlike the 0.5 binary); please let me know ASAP if this isn't so.

Changes since 0.5 are:

History window now shows both 'where you've been' and
  'where you can go'.
Previously visited nodes are colored differently, a la Midaswww;
  this global history is automatically persistent across sessions.
New resources for customization, including:
  Show URLs instead of Document Titles.
  Customize window per document feature.
  Optionally have pointer and focus warp to keyword entry field
    when you reach a searchable node.
  Optionally turn off global history mechanism.
  Specify home document (overridden by WWW_HOME env variable).
Button2 can now activate anchors; forces a new window
  to open (as with Window Per Document feature).
Going from a document necessarily wider than the window
  (e.g. preformatted text) to a normal document will now
  get rid of the horizontal scrollbar and reformat properly.
Scrollbar and document page state is maintained so stepping
  through the history list lands you were last in each document.
Addition of Whine option under Help.
Addition of Go To and Go To Local options under Navigate.
Addition of outlet to Ghostview for PostScript documents
  (this is a hack but it's a slick demo feature).
<listing> is now recognized.
Tabs now work in preformatted/plaintext regions.
Numeric character references are now handled.
Anchors without href's aren't colored anymore.
Search Keyword field's sensitivity is managed correctly now.
SIGINT now interrupts network connections too
  (so you can hit Ctrl-C in shell window at any time).
Memory leak in document reformatting nailed.
Cloning a window is now intelligent and doesn't do a network
  reload; also, window size is maintained.
Layout glitches fixed.
Text selection glitches fixed.
Other misc bugfixes and cleanups.
Better help.

Although this is alpha/beta software, I'm looking more for feedback on
design and functionality than bug reports right now -- down the road
the bulk of the program will be rewritten in C++ anyway, so don't take
the current code too seriously.  But bug reports are welcome too.  New
releases will probably come out about every 7-14 days until 1.0
arrives.

Cheers,
Marc

==================
Hi, 
I am new in this mailing list. I am working at the University of Hannover, where
I am building an information system for our institut. One way of getting 
information is to allow each person of our institut to save news from a news
server in a global mail file. For proving this information via WWW I need a
mail gateway for WWW as I have found it for wais and other formats. 

Is there anybody working on a mail gateway for WWW or is it already available 
on the net? 
Thanks in advance.
	Lutz

So I enter a searchable document, and my browser lets me make a query,
resulting in URL, say, 'foo?keyword'.  

The resulting document is also searchable.  So I make another query.

Should the resulting URL be 'foo?keyword?anotherkeyword' or
'foo?anotherkeyword' ... ???

Surely it depends whether the second search is 'refining' the first one, or
is another search on the original document? If it is continuing the first
search, then it shouldnt be foo?anotherkeyword, as this will mean the first
search will be ignored.

Well, I agree, but how does my poor li'l browser tell the difference?

It should be foo?anotherkeyword as the existing search is stripped  
off.  There is an HTSearch() which does it.

    Hi,
        I've mentioned this previously without raising any particular
        definitive response and thought I'll bring it up once again:

        I run viola/www on a diskless SUN Sparcstation 1+ served by a
        SUN690MP and I find that viola "leaks memory" quite badly such
        that I am forced to exit all processes and start over about once
        a week. I am wondering if anyone else has seen this kind of problem
        on their machine?

Subject: Re:  viola/www memory leak

Well, a relatively astonishing number of leaks have been discovered 
(by purify) and plugged up in my working copy of viola. So, in the 
Next Release you should no longer need to restart your Xserver 
periodically, as much. (The X server was a victim of viola's habit 
of piling up pixmaps and fonts...).

"When's the next release?" ...I'm working on it. <fuzzylogic>This 
indefinite answer has much to do with the viola and the browser's 
indefinite number of features which are currently being, and 
considered to be, added</fuzzylogic>.

It's been a while since an update, but I think you'll like it when 
it's out. Meanwhile, there is Marc's Xmosaic, which seems very
well done!

Subject: Usenet FAQ Project
X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.1

Well, I've completed a draft of the format to be used by FAQ writers, and
software that converts it to HTML.  Take a look at the "Usenet FAQs" item
found in:

HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/information/information.html"

This will get you to a (almost empty) list of FAQs which conform and have
been formatted.  Currently the only thing here is my as yet unposted
posting, in hypertext form.

Go to the part on more information.  This includes the
posting (which hasn't actually been posted yet).  Also, since the posting
itself will conform to the format described therein, you will also find
the hypertext version of the posting in the same document.

Please take a look, and pass comments back to me.  If I don't hear anything
for a couple of days, I'll assume everything is fine and go ahead and post.

I'm still wrestling with one problem:  How do I tell people who are
naive to the ways of WWW how to find this specific information in the
web?  I've listed all the browsers around, and each one comes up with a
different view of the web.  I suppose I could just include the URL, but
then they'd have to figure out how to get whichever browser they picked
to go there.  Any suggestions?

If you want to glance at the software, send me mail, and I'll send you
a copy.

Things not completed yet:
  Still doesn't automatically scan news.
  Software doesn't automatically insert itself into our web (trivial).

	tom

P.S.  My future agenda:
  1. complete editor  (very soon)
  2. update browser   (very soon)
  3. clean up all of our documentation so it actually conforms (soon)
  4. write some fun robots (slightly soon)
  5. work on MIME stuff (not real soon)
  6. work on hypertext postscript (not real soon)

The files are now in /pub/www/bin/vms.   Note that if you have  
different sharable libraries you will need the object files --  
contact Julain for coordinates.

The executable is either 0.1 or 0.5 of Xmosaic   -- I'm not sure!

Subject:  an Idea for a new WWW disc. group

Hi,

I think it is time to create a new group for all the users of the WWW, that
will let them exchange ideas of data sources ect.

In the Hebrew University we have created several data bases on our WWW which
may be intersting to other users of the WWW.
(GcG - for Genetic Biolegy, Tex and more)

I think that the www-talk is more for the technical side of the WWW, and there
should be another list like WWW-DATA for exchanging information about data
sources.

Sounds great to me....does anyone understand the formal 
procedure for going about creating a new comp.* newsgroup? How 
do we start?

I say let's start with one, and go from there.

I'll push this through.  A quick summary of what I have to do:
I post a Request For Discussion to news.announce.newgroups, in which I
propose the newsgroup, its ensues, in which everyone agrees with my
proposal (yeah, right!), and then it goes to vote.

It's not clear to me how long the discussion lasts, the regular posting
says 30 days, but that may be only if no agreement is made.  I believe
if an agreement can be made quickly, a vote can be called for sooner.
But there's plenty of time to find that out after the discussion has
been started.

Also, In addition to news.announce.newgroups, I should post to other
relevant newsgroups.  Does anyone have any suggestions of groups where this
posting should go?  I was figuring on comp.infosystems.  (Suggest quick,
I'll give you all a couple of hours.)

Note that the disussion will take place in news.groups.  Follow-ups to
the request for discussion will go there automatically.

     tom

BTW, Here's the regualar posting that describes the whole procedure.

				 GUIDELINES FOR USENET GROUP CREATION

REQUIREMENTS FOR GROUP CREATION:

   These are guidelines that have been generally agreed upon across
USENET as appropriate for following in the creating of new newsgroups in
the "standard" USENET newsgroup hierarchy. They are NOT intended as 
guidelines for setting USENET policy other than group creations, and they
are not intended to apply to "alternate" or local news hierarchies. The 
part of the namespace affected is comp, news, sci, misc, soc, talk, rec,
which are the most widely-distributed areas of the USENET hierarchy.
   Any group creation request which follows these guidelines to a
successful result should be honored, and any request which fails to
follow these procedures or to obtain a successful result from doing so
should be dropped, except under extraordinary circumstances.  The
reason these are called guidelines and not absolute rules is that it is
not possible to predict in advance what "extraordinary circumstances"
are or how they might arise.
   It should be pointed out here that, as always, the decision whether or not
to create a newsgroup on a given machine rests with the administrator of that
machine. These guidelines are intended merely as an aid in making those
decisions.


The Discussion

1) A request for discussion on creation of a new newsgroup should be posted to
   news.announce.newgroups, and also to any other groups or mailing lists at
   all related to the proposed topic if desired.  The group is moderated, and
   the Followup-to: header will be set so that the actual discussion takes
   place only in news.groups.  Users on sites which have difficulty posting to
   moderated groups may mail submissions intended for news.announce.newgroups
   to announce-newgroups@uunet.uu.net.

   The article should be cross-posted among the newsgroups, including
   news.announce.newgroups, rather than posted as separate articles.  Note that
   standard behaviour for posting software is to not present the articles in
   any groups when cross-posted to a moderated group; the moderator will handle
   that for you.

2) The name and charter of the proposed group and whether it will be moderated
   or unmoderated (and if the former, who the moderator(s) will be) should be
   determined during the discussion period. If there is no general agreement on
   these points among the proponents of a new group at the end of 30 days of
   discussion, the discussion should be taken offline (into mail instead of
   news.groups) and the proponents should iron out the details among
   themselves.  Once that is done, a new, more specific proposal may be made,
   going back to step 1) above.  

3) Group advocates seeking help in choosing a name to suit the proposed
   charter, or looking for any other guidance in the creation procedure, can
   send a message to group-advice@uunet.uu.net; a few seasoned news administrators
   are available through this address.

The Vote

1) AFTER the discussion period, if it has been determined that a new group is
   really desired, a name and charter are agreed upon, and it has been
   determined whether the group will be moderated and if so who will
   moderate it, a call for votes may be posted to news.announce.newgroups and
   any other groups or mailing lists that the original request for discussion
   might have been posted to. There should be minimal delay between the
   end of the discussion period and the issuing of a call for votes.
   The call for votes should include clear instructions for how to cast
   a vote. It must be as clearly explained and as easy to do to cast a
   vote for creation as against it, and vice versa.  It is explicitly
   permitted to set up two separate addresses to mail yes and no votes
   to provided that they are on the same machine, to set up an address
   different than that the article was posted from to mail votes to, or
   to just accept replies to the call for votes article, as long as it
   is clearly and explicitly stated in the call for votes article how
   to cast a vote.  If two addresses are used for a vote, the reply
   address must process and accept both yes and no votes OR reject
   them both.

2) The voting period should last for at least 21 days and no more than 31
   days, no matter what the preliminary results of the vote are. The exact
   date that the voting period will end should be stated in the call for
   votes. Only votes that arrive on the vote-taker's machine prior to this
   date will be counted.

3) A couple of repeats of the call for votes may be posted during the vote, 
   provided that they contain similar clear, unbiased instructions for
   casting a vote as the original, and provided that it is really a repeat
   of the call for votes on the SAME proposal (see #5 below). Partial vote
   results should NOT be included; only a statement of the specific new
   group proposal, that a vote is in progress on it, and how to cast a vote.
   It is permitted to post a "mass acknowledgement" in which all the names
   of those from whom votes have been received are posted, as long as no
   indication is made of which way anybody voted until the voting period
   is officially over.

4) ONLY votes MAILED to the vote-taker will count. Votes posted to the net
   for any reason (including inability to get mail to the vote-taker) and 
   proxy votes (such as having a mailing list maintainer claim a vote for 
   each member of the list) will not be counted.

5) Votes may not be transferred to other, similar proposals. A vote shall
   count only for the EXACT proposal that it is a response to. In particular,
   a vote for or against a newsgroup under one name shall NOT be counted as
   a vote for or against a newsgroup with a different name or charter,
   a different moderated/unmoderated status or (if moderated) a different
   moderator or set of moderators.

6) Votes MUST be explicit; they should be of the form "I vote for the
   group foo.bar as proposed" or "I vote against the group foo.bar
   as proposed". The wording doesn't have to be exact, it just needs to
   be unambiguous. In particular, statements of the form "I would vote
   for this group if..." should be considered comments only and not
   counted as votes.

7) A vote should be run only for a single group proposal.  Attempts to create
   multiple groups should be handled by running multiple parallel votes rather
   than one vote to create all of the groups.

The Result

1) At the completion of the voting period, the vote taker must post the
   vote tally and the E-mail addresses and (if available) names of the voters
   received to news.announce.newgroups and any other groups or mailing lists
   to which the original call for votes was posted. The tally should include
   a statement of which way each voter voted so that the results can be
   verified.

2) AFTER the vote result is posted, there will be a 5 day waiting period,
   beginning when the voting results actually appear in 
   news.announce.newgroups, during which the net will have a chance to
   correct any errors in the voter list or the voting procedure.

3) AFTER the waiting period, and if there were no serious objections that might
   invalidate the vote, and if 100 more valid YES/create votes are received
   than NO/don't create AND at least 2/3 of the total number of valid votes
   received are in favor of creation, a newgroup control message may be sent 
   out.  If the 100 vote margin or 2/3 percentage is not met, the group should 
   not be created.

4) The newgroup message will be sent by the news.announce.newgroups moderator
   at the end of the waiting period of a successful vote.  If the new group is
   moderated, the vote-taker should send a message during the waiting period to
   Gene Spafford <spaf@cs.purdue.edu> and David C. Lawrence <tale@uunet.uu.net> with
   both the moderator's contact address and the group's submission address.

5) A proposal which has failed under point (3) above should not again be
   brought up for discussion until at least six months have passed from the
   close of the vote.  This limitation does not apply to proposals which never
   went to vote.

	1)	Someone has to write RFD (Request For Discussion) for
		c.i.w and c.i.w.i
	2)	post it to announce-newgroups@rpi.edu (or post it
		to moderated newsgroup news.announce.newgroups.
		Remember to add before your RFD text all the
		newsgroups you want the article to appear if
		you email it.
	3)	The discussion period is about 30 days, and
		should be in news.groups newsgroup.
	4)	Then if it's clear that such a newsgroup should
		be available you can write CFV (Call For Voting)
	5)	Take care you have other person as vote-taker,
		so you can make propaganda for your group (other
		than RFD ;-).
	6)	The voting period is 21-31 days.
	7)	When the group passes, it takes 7 days until the
		group is created.
	8)	If the group does _not_ pass the next voting is

This is all in monthly postings to comp.news.newuser or somesuch.  
There is a pointer to that group in the web if you browsee throug the  
newsgroups.

Do check with Ed first or if you can't get him, mention in a preface  
to the moderator that you think that Ed sent in a CFD which got lost  
in the wash.  Groups which start with muddled different CFDs confuse  
people and are frowned on...

Subject: Re: an Idea for a new WWW disc. group


A newsgroup for the World Wide Web project is really missing
and positioning the newsgroup beside of comp.infosystems.gopher
and comp.infosystems.wais is ideal.

But I would prefer as a name for the new group: 

comp.infosystems.world-wide-web

instead of

comp.infosystems.www.

WWW is much shorter and easier to write, but only insiders know what
www is standing for. The name world-wide-web on the other side gives
instantly an idea of the intentions of such a system. So for
presentation and public relation purposes the term world-wide-web 
is much better.

Another problem is the pronounciation of www. Has anyone a suggestion?

Finally I would like to suggest that we come to an agreement
on how to name the World Wide Web project in speech and writing.
In the past I have seen the following terms:

World Wide Web, World-Wide-Web, WorldWideWeb, world-wide-web,
www, WWW, W3, w3,

Compare this confusing collection of terms with the term "Gopher".
"Gopher" is a single, easy pronouncable and associative term.

And the terms for the different browsers and other software:

www, WWW, viola, violaWWW, WWWViola, tkwww, TkWWW, tkWWW, midaswww,
MidasWWW, Xmosaic, xmosaic, X Mosaic, WWWNextStep, WWWLibrary,
HTMLGate, WWWLineMode, www_and_frame, print-www, WWWMailRobot ...

When I first come to info.cern.ch last year with just a vague idea
of what World Wide Web could mean. I was very confused and it takes
some time and experimentation until I know what I need to get started.
The situation now is b even worse.

A lot of people have to type in newsgroup names.  They just won't  
read comp.infosystems.world-wide-web!  www is no more crypict than  
wais, and gopher is not very explanatory for all its uniqueness.

We write "World-Wide Web (W3)" at the start of every paper, and W3  
from then on.

[BTW: W3 was chosen eventually because a in many languages to  
pronounce WWW takes longer than saying World-Wide Web and people just  
couldn't handle it.  So we suggest the pronounciation "double you  
three".  (We ruled out W cubed because though it is more logical you  
can't superscript in mail.  We ruled out V6 because its to cute.  We  
ruled out InfoMesh and then MIT used it. We have only found one  
company called WWW --- a technical documentation company in Freiburg  
who have a "WWW explain" product. Their advertisement doesn't say  
what WWW stands for there. (Maybe you could phone them on 0761/40 10  
221 and find out, Arnold!)

That is the project.  Filenames, logos, etc all use WWW as it is  
catchy, easy to see and type. But of course lower case is de riguer
in unix commands and ftp directories normally. Hence www.

Is in the 14 character limit, so sounds ok. Its just that the software and
the project has always been WWW. (Similar to WAIS - from its acronym, it
isnt obvious what it is).
> Another problem is the pronounciation of www. Has anyone a suggestion?

I originally tried 'double-ewe double-ewe double-ewe', but that got to be
too annoying, so 'double-ewe three' works fine for me. :)

Most of the documentation I've seen from CERN have either 'World Wide
Web' or 'WWW'.

Its actually pretty similar to the Gopher world, there's Gopher, XGopher,
Turbo-Gopher, and no doubt other clients that I dont know about. :)

Explaining this sort of thing is what FAQ's are for :-)

I just phoned them.

WWW stands for: "Wirtschaftswerbung Woerlen". "Wirtschaftswerbung" means
"Business to Business Communication" and Mr. Woerlen is the big boss
of WWW.

"WWW Explain" is the name of a subsidiary of WWW which is offering
technical documentation services.

They told me about the same problems with pronounciation of WWW in
different languages.

And they gave me a hint, that there is a service available which looks
for and verifies names for other companies. A name shall cost about 
70000 Deutsche Mark or 44000 US $.

Subject: Announcing tkWWW Version 0.5 Alpha


tkWWW Version 0.5 alpha (joe@athena.mit.edu)
--------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext project which seeks to build a
world wide network of hypertext links.  There are several different
browsers for this system including a simple tty interface.  For a 
demo of the terminal browsers for WWW, telnet to the following sites:

 telnet info.cern.ch or telnet 128.141.201.74 (SWISS)
 telnet eies2.njit.edu or telnet 128.235.1.43 (USA [NJ])
 telnet vms.huji.ac.il or telnet 128.139.4.3  (ISRAEL)
 telnet info.funet.fi or telnet 128.214.6.100 (FINLAND)

 and login as "www"

Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily.

tkWWW is a Tk interface to (WWW), which lets you send embedded buttons,
scrollbars, etc in hypertext written for WWW.

The Tk browser has the following advantages.

1. Since the entire user interface is written in an interpreted 
   language, it should be very easy to make modifications and extensions
   to the system.

2. tkWWW can be configured with the "htext" widget which makes it is 
   possible to imbed Tk code into hypertext or with the "text" widget
   which makes it possible to display multi-fonts.  In the next few
   months, there will be a new revision of tK which will allow imbeded
   tK code with the "text" widget and support for the tkWWW "htext" widget
   will be discontinued.

WHERE IS THIS?
--------------
tkWWW 0.5 can be anon ftp'ed from
   export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/tkWWW-0.5.tar.Z
   barkley.berkeley.edu:/tcl/extensions/tkWWW-0.5.tar.Z
   info.cern.ch:/pub/WWW/src/tkWWW-0.5.tar.Z

WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE 0.4?
---------------------------
Converted tkWWW to use www library 1.1a
Introduced multi-fonts
Added menu options to access various tkWWW sources.
Added cloning by pressing button2.

MAILING LIST
------------
There is a mailing list devoted to discussions about tkWWW at 
 
   tk-www@athena.mit.edu

To get on this list, send e-mail to

   tk-www-request@athena.mit.edu

INSTALLATION
----------

1. Edit the file "tkWWW.imake" to set system defaults

2. Type the following commands in the directory TkWWW

    xmkmf
    make world
    make install

Subject: annotations, personal -> private
X-Md4-Signature: a3eda1763429c6ab429419a514de9c0a

Version 0.7 of X Mosaic will have personal annotations: for any
document, you can make an annotation (or several annotations) that
will be inlined into the document you're annotating each time you
access that document.  (Actually, a link to the annotation is inlined,
but anyway...)

This is the first step towards a more complicated subject.  To wit,
there is a wide spectrum between wholly personal annotations and
openly public annotations.  The former can be implemented easily by
storing annotations in one's local directory; the latter (potentially)
by having servers store and serve annotations to documents they
themselves serve (an approach that is used by at least one existing
system, the Worm Community System from the University of Arizona,
which is serving as my initial model for annotation/asynch
collaboration capabilities).

However, suppose you want to share some annotations with one other
person, some with your department (~10 people), some with your
organization (~200 people), and some with the whole world.  What then?

Here's one idea: a new type of server, an annotation server, will be
run by each group of people desiring to share annotations among
themselves.  This server will archive, maintain, and serve annotations
to any document in the web to the members of the group only.  Every
time a member of one or more of these group does a document access,
her client checks with the appropriate annotation servers (as in the
above example, there could be 3 or 4 of 'em).

(A modified version of this scenario is to run a centralized
annotation server per organization, and to allow subgroups to be
established at will within that organization but managed by the same
server.)

These issues shade over into other types of asynch collaboration
issues, including web-based revision control, protection at the
document level, and so on.

So what do people think?  Ideas I haven't thought of?  Problems with
ideas I have thought of?

Subject: First release of Gopher+ clients and server
Newsgroups: comp.infosystems.gopher
Distribution: comp

Dateline: Minneapolis, MN  9 Feb 1993

The University of Minnesota Internet Gopher Team is pleased to announce
the availability of first beta release of gopher+ clients and server.
Now available for anonymous ftp from boombox.micro.umn.edu are:

   TurboGopher1.6b1       ---  A Gopher+ client for the Macintosh

   available as /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/TurboGopher.1.06b1.hqx

and 

   gopher+1.2beta.tar.Z   ---  A Gopher+ client and server for Unix systems

   available as /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher+1.12.tar.Z


After spending most of January eating turnips we have our first test
release of Gopher+ software.  However, not all features have been
implemented yet, and there is plenty of testing to be done.  You
probably don't want to give this to everyone on your campus.... 
yet :-) 

Please, *Please*, Please send bug reports to
gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu 


Features currently implemented for TurboGopher
----------------------------------------------

Supports Multiple views of documents.

Fetches item attributes (administrator, modification date etc.)

Supports access to "Admit1" gopher+ servers

   (Admit1 is an extension to Gopher+ that allows secure
    authentication on a per user basis to servers using a ticketing
    scheme)

User selectable helper applications for displaying alternate views and
images. 

Support for JPEG, GIF, PICT, and sundry other image/document formats.

Intelligent Gopher+ error handling.

File retrieval status is displayed in a separate window for each
retrieval.  This makes it easy to terminate file retrievals or obtain
status when several concurrent retrievals are active.

Rudimentary support for ASK queries from the server.


Features currently implemented for the UNIX client
--------------------------------------------------

Intelligent Gopher+ error handling.

Fetches item attributes (administrator, modification date etc.)

Supports Multiple views of documents.

Gripe command allows the user to complain to the specific adminstrator
of a document.

Configurable helper applications for displaying alternate views and
images. 

More than rudimentary support for ASK queries from the server.


Features currently implemented for the UNIX server
--------------------------------------------------

Supports ASK blocks. Allows answers to multiple queries to be
retrieved from a gopher+ client.

Supports multiple views via configurable filename extension mapping. 

Basic Gopher+ error responses.

Item attributes (administrator, abstracts, etc.)

Very little documentation, but a bunch of examples

Replacement code for .cap files.


Gopher+ attribute registry
--------------------------

The Gopher+ attribute is available via gopher on host

Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu 
Port=70
Path=0/gopher/gopher_protocol/Gopher+/Gopher+AttributeRegistry

This is also available via ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu


Gopher+ example server
----------------------

We are also running an example gopher+ example server.

Connect to gopher.tc.umn.edu and select:

   Information about Gopher
      Gopher+ example server

Note that the machine this points to will be changing soon.  We will
update the link to be current..  (i.e. don't depend on it being on
mudhoney.micro.umn.edu)

    TimBL asked me to pass on details of the VMS port. Although it seemed
rather tricky at the time, the actual changes for VMS are simple. Instead
of sending you the diff -c results, they can be summarised as:

    1) In gui.c, #ifdef VMS to avoid including unistd.h
    2) In main.c, #ifdef VMS then do not signal SIGUSR1 (ugly fix)
    3) In Xresources.h I had to change all 17 point fonts to 18 point,
       as the DECwindows MOTIF seems to lack them. I also changed
       the anchor colour to Red instead of hex 9f, since some people's
       X defaults specified a blue background, so making the anchors
       invisible!
    4) STRDUP was missing from VMS, and from the Ultrix system I used.
       So I included a version as a separate file.

Finally, I wrote a little VMS command file that does the compile and
link for VMS systems running Multinet. This is included below, as is
STRDUP.

Subject: X Mosaic update, and question.
X-Md4-Signature: 60bdc51efee7e78cb308f0ae892518eb

Just an X Mosaic update, and a question...

Update: 0.7 is almost ready to go; some more stress testing and we'll
ship.  A list of things that have changed follows.

Question: X Mosaic is starting to get big.  And it's probably starting
to slow down a little, due to a lot of the housekeeping things needed
to support the more advanced functionality, user interface components,
and so on.  We're basically developing with fast RISC boxes in mind as
the platform for running Mosaic, but we realize that many sites (in
particular, those with large numbers of machines and in
non-development environments) don't have that much power for their
user base.  At what point will we start making X Mosaic unusable for
people with less-powerful systems?  In particular, what kinds of
features, and GUI toys, are particularly expendable for performance
reasons?  And how concerned should we be about this anyway?

Anyhow, on to the current list of changes (cut straight out of X
Mosaic with the new fancy selections feature :-):

Help On Mosaic v0.7
*******************

Version 0.7 includes the following changes from version 0.6:

 o Annotations!
    o Personal only (until smart servers get written).
    o Automatic inlining of annotation pointers into documents.
    o Annotations automatically persistent across sessions
      (naturally).
    o Annotations are subsequently editable/removable.
    o Lots of neat GUI things.
 o Underlined anchors! You're gonna love this.
    o 0, 1, 2, or 3 underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
    o Solid or dashed underlines for each of unvisited and
      previously visited anchor types.
 o Application exits when all windows are closed.
 o Support for <menu> and <dir>.
 o Better support for nested lists (filled bullets, empty bullets, empty
   boxes).
 o Better selection capabilities:
    o Select by character.
    o New resource, fancySelections: if true, selections will be
      "pretty-printed" when pasted into a normal X window (with
      underlined headers, bullets for lists, etc.). This is modifiable
      per-window from the menubar also.
 o Additional command-line argument: free-standing URL will be used
   as home document, and overrides all other specifications (including
   WWW_HOME, X resource homeDocument, and -home flag). Is that
   enough ways to specify the home document??? :-)
 o Additional command-line flag -mono, for getting black&white
   fallback X defaults... you mono people out there are gonna have to let
   me know if I'm providing a decent set of mono resources. Should
   there be a distinction between -mono and -greyscale??
 o Middle button button in scrolled lists is now equivalent of
   double-clicking with left button.
 o Performance enhancement for history window's future list.
 o Fix for gopher connection port usage.
 o Fix for proper gopher and WAIS document titles.
 o Temporary fix to access Supreme Court documents on Cornell Law
   School server (if manager of that server is out there, please contact me
   -- you have a problem).
 o Option menu for document title/url display at top of window.
 o Cute icons in upper right-hand corner of windows for quick window
   ID.
 o Previous search keyword is trimmed correctly.
 o Search keyword remains in text field until search is complete.
 o New 'Clear Global History' option (to revert all anchors back to the
   unvisited color).
 o Fixed bug in hotlist geometry layout.
 o Lots of new resources:
    o confirmExit
    o ghostviewCommand
    o mailCommand
    o printCommand
    o xtermCommand
    o globalHistoryFile
    o defaultHotlistFile
    o personalAnnotationDirectory
 o Tabs now behave absolutely properly in preformatted text.
 o Fixed premature signal setup causing coredump when ctrl-c was hit
   during startup.
 o Hotlist is saved every time it's changed, to avoid losing information.
 o Busy cursor is used more often, as it should be.
 o Better handling of telnet/xterm functions (forked into background;
   browser never lands on 'telnet' document).
 o Ghostview runs in background now.
 o Changed application class name to 'XMosaic' for consistency.
 o Minor bugfixes and cleanups.

Many many thanks to all the users who have sent in comments, bug
reports, and suggestions... I hope 0.7 lives up to the promises I've
made as a result :-).

Cheers,
Marc

We're mostly a bunch of 8 Meg, 12 Mips Monochrome Sun SLCs with no
local swap.  With 0.6, we get a big start-up wait (about 15 seconds),
but after that response is acceptable.  Also, I noticed that if you
don't strip the binary, it's roughly 2.5Meg.  If you do strip it, its
about 1.5Meg.  Unstripped, its bigger then an unstripped emacs;
stripped its smaller than a stripped emacs.  Imagine if someone
implemented a Motif version of emacs...  Speaking of which, you
_are_ well under the size of FrameMaker (3.1 Meg stripped).

It's hard for me to say what things could be dropped.  Everything is
just so cool.  Perhaps if you could try to figure out which things take
up all the space?

Also, could you please have it die with SIGINT?

I am testing out the new library (2.alpha?) which has a lot of
new features largely as a result comment on this list (many from
Dan Connoly, but also others). So I thought I'd bounce the end result  
off you all as to check it for stupidities.

The driving forces are putting in MIME, and allowing the library
to be used by disparate browsers and editors and servers without
modification.

The thing is still all portable C but even more OO in style. Two new  
objects are HTStream which is something you can write to .. it  
supports

	put_character
	put_string
	write 	/* buffer */
	end
	free

Some of the machinery works character by character
(state machine parsers) but it's useful to have faster methods when
there is no characterwise intervention.

This is to allow MIME encoding pipelines to be built, as well as the
existing facilities to be more flexible.  Streams stack, and freeing
the top of the stack frees off the stack.  As a side issue the stream
idea allows the difference between sockets and FILE * to be overcome
cleanly without the hacks necessary on some systems which shall be  
nameless. Streams subclasses exist to

	write to a FILE *
	write to a socket
	parse an SGML file of (dtd)
		pushing the results into (structured)
	convert plain text to valid HTML -> other stream
	format a (structured) described by (dtd) as plain text
		pushing the results -> other stream
	parse a MIME document (to come)

There is a different creation routine for each case.
The "structured" object is a subclass of HTStream called  
HTStructured. It is a sort of rich stream, accepting also the methods

	start_element(element_number, attributes)
	end_element(elemenet_number)
	put_entity(entity_number)

Obviously an HTStructured thing has a pointer to a DTD structure
so that the element numbers and entity numbers make sense.
Elements and entities are passed around as numbers so that the
string lookup is only done once if at all.

Structued subclasses objects exist to

	Pretty-print structued text to plain text stream
	Generate SGML for the stream, given its DTD
	Present the structured object to the user

This last one is the one you browser writers hook into
and it should be alot easier than tangling with styles.

You can also of course regenerate the stream from your
widget and use the HTML generator structured object
to write your file back to the server. (Thisis to
encourage more hypertext editors out there!)

There is another class of object called a protocol.
It supports GET and will soon support PUT and other
useful things.  Current subclasses handle

	http
	news
	gopher
	files and directories
	FTP files and directories
	WAIS without gateway will come

Typically News and Gophe protocol
objects ask for a HTStructured object (which may
in fact go to a display, or a client if we are a server, or
a file etc through a small stream stack) and build it.
Although the structured object is defined by a DTD,
and has an SGML model, there is no generation of SGML from
news, etc within a browser for speed (unless the user wants
to save something as SGML).

Other things .. a common interface for alerts, confirmation and  
questions to the user from the bowels of the library,  and sometime a  
spinning callback for geting out of
those long timeouts..

Constructive criticism welcome, I'll put the code out
when I can.

Subject: X Mosaic 0.7 released
X-Md4-Signature: dfeb02d3c78b96c5a3c700be40e36854

Shazam and kaboom -- beta version 0.7 of NCSA's Motif-based networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, X Mosaic, is hereby
released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/xmosaic-0.7.tar.Z

This release of X Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DEC Ultrix.

Binaries for these platforms are available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/binaries-0.7

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working binaries
are welcome.)  Documentation is available online, but is temporarily
out of date (I'll probably bring it up to date this weekend).

Changes since 0.6 include:

 o Annotations!
    o Personal only (until smart servers get written).
    o Automatic inlining of annotation pointers into documents.
    o Annotations automatically persistent across sessions (naturally).
    o Annotations are subsequently editable/removable.
    o Lots of neat GUI things.
 o Underlined anchors! You're gonna love this.
    o 0, 1, 2, or 3 underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
    o Solid or dashed underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
 o Application exits when all windows are closed.
 o Support for <menu> and <dir>.
 o Better support for nested lists (filled bullets, empty bullets, 
   empty boxes).
 o Better selection capabilities:
    o Select by character.
    o New resource, fancySelections: if true, selections will be
      "pretty-printed" when pasted into a normal X window (with
      underlined headers, bullets for lists, etc.). This is modifiable
      per-window from the menubar also.
 o Additional command-line argument: free-standing URL will be used as
   home document, and overrides all other specifications (including
   WWW_HOME, X resource homeDocument, and -home flag). Is that
   enough ways to specify the home document??? :-)
 o Additional command-line flag -mono, for getting black&white fallback
   X defaults... you mono people out there are gonna have to let me know if
   I'm providing a decent set of mono resources. Should there be a
   distinction between -mono and -greyscale??
 o Middle button button in scrolled lists is now equivalent of
   double-clicking with left button.
 o Performance enhancement for history window's future list.
 o Fix for gopher connection port usage.
 o Fix for proper gopher and WAIS document titles.
 o Temporary fix to access Supreme Court documents on Cornell Law
   School server (if manager of that server is out there, please contact me --
   you have a problem).
 o Option menu for document title/url display at top of window.
 o Cute icons in upper right-hand corner of windows for quick window ID.
 o Previous search keyword is trimmed correctly.
 o Search keyword remains in text field until search is complete.
 o New 'Clear Global History' option (to revert all anchors back to the
   unvisited color).
 o Fixed bug in hotlist geometry layout.
 o Lots of new resources:
    o confirmExit
    o ghostviewCommand
    o mailCommand
    o printCommand
    o xtermCommand
    o globalHistoryFile
    o defaultHotlistFile
    o personalAnnotationDirectory
 o Tabs now behave absolutely properly in preformatted text.
 o Fixed premature signal setup causing coredump when ctrl-c was hit
   during startup.
 o Hotlist is saved every time it's changed, to avoid losing information.
 o Busy cursor is used more often, as it should be.
 o Better handling of telnet/xterm functions (forked into background;
   browser never lands on 'telnet' document).
 o Ghostview runs in background now.
 o Changed application class name to 'XMosaic' for consistency.
 o Minor bugfixes and cleanups.

Although this is beta software, I'm looking more for feedback on
design and functionality than bug reports right now -- down the road
the bulk of the program will be rewritten in C++ anyway, so don't take
the current code too seriously.  But bug reports are welcome too.  New
releases will probably come out about every 7-14 days until 1.0
arrives.

Finally, thanks again to everyone who's contributed comments and bug
reports, and please... keep 'em coming.

Cheers,
Marc & Eric

Subject: CIS gateways, waisgate patches are available now

I just made our man page, RFC and info gateways available for
anonymous ftp (ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu, /pub/www/cis.tar.Z).  I've
included our patches to WAISGate that allow it to use a rules file to
remap document addresses to other gateways.  There's a brief README
and a longer about_this_cobweb.html that describe how things fit
together.  

The man page converter works on the formatted versions of the man
pages, so that we don't have to deal with the various macro packages
as well as eqn and tbl.  We create the HTML versions of all of the man
pages and store those somewhere for efficiency (time, not space!).
The converter turns man page and rfc references into anchors.

The rfc converter works on the fly - it retrieves things from our
anonymous ftp repository, uncompresses them, and converts them into
html, turning things that look like rfc references into anchors.

The infogate daemon is a modified version of the info2html script
written by Eelco van Asperen <evas@cs.few.eur.nl>.  Like the rfc
converter, it works on the fly.  References look like "tar.info",
which would retrieve the node named "Top" from the file tar.info, or
"tar.info,Why", which refers to the node named "Why".

Have fun, let me know if you find bugs.  Since this stuff is available
now, I'd appreciate it if sites could set up their own man page
gateways - we don't have a way to restrict access right now, but I am
somewhat concerned about licensing violations and all that.  We plan
to leave the rfc, ien, and emacs info gateways open, and you're
welcome to use them.

It isn't mentioned much in the docs, but the Makefile includes the
commands we use to index the Usenet FAQ's from news.answers.  You
might find that useful as well.

Subject: X Mosaic 0.8 released
X-Md4-Signature: 3357bd9c76b53a8bdb32c82bfde27cce

With a bang and a whimper, beta version 0.8 of NCSA's Motif-based
networked information systems and World Wide Web browser, X Mosaic, is
hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/xmosaic-0.8.tar.Z

This release of X Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DEC Ultrix.

Binaries for these platforms are available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/binaries-0.8

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working binaries
are welcome.)  Documentation is available online, but is temporarily
out of date (I'll probably bring it up to date this weekend).

Changes since 0.7 include:

 o Telnet access is enabled for IBM systems (and others that don't define
   'unix' by default).
 o TN3270 access is now available (probably will only work on IBM
   systems).
 o Underline setting now carries from window to window like it should.
 o Stupid little bugs nailed in open local file routines.
 o More stupid little bugs nailed in opening multiple windows.
 o Fixed buglet with text fields on some platforms.
 o Most plaintext documents can now be annotated (except for results of
   WAIS queries and those that use <plaintext> explicitly).
 o Annotate and Edit Annotation menubar entries disabled for stupid Ultrix,
   since the annotation window causes a spurious BadWindow error for no
   apparent reason at all.
 o Better colors (including brighter colors on non-SGI platforms).
 o Makefile option to compile with mono colors as the default.
 o Revised copyright notice.
 o A few random bugfixes and cleanups.

Although this is beta software, I'm looking more for feedback on
design and functionality than bug reports right now -- down the road
the bulk of the program will be rewritten in C++ anyway, so don't take
the current code too seriously.  But bug reports are welcome too.  New

   Thank you for proposing the WWW group.  Let me know when
   you plan to vote.

   I agree on the name of the group (comp.infosystems.www).

   I agree that part of the purpose should be discussing the
   use, design, and development of WWW (double-ewe three)
   and discussing what information that is/will be/should be
   available in the Web.

I would also like to see:

* Announcements about what software is available, how to get
   it, how stable it is, who worked on it, where to report
   problems to or get help from, etc.  I realize that this
   information is also in the Web itself -- perhaps someone
   can come up with a tool which automatically groks the
   appropriate portions of WWW hypertext and posts it once a
   month the comp.infosystems.www, for those who don't
   already have the ability to get to the Web but who are
   interested in it?

* Discussion of how to package WWW software so that it is
   trivial to build and install on as many platforms as
   possible, including Macintosh and other microcomputers?
   By "software", I mean:

       1) WWW hypertext browsing clients,
       2) WWW hypertext servers,
       3) WWW hypertext preparation tools -- utilities &
       clients which make it possible for a non-technical
       clerical staff person to write and provide
       information in the Web.

   There are also gateway programs to other sources of info
   (e.g. FTP, NNTP, TechInfo), but they don't necessarily
   have to run on as wide a variety of platforms as the
   three types of tools above.  But they should be easily
   installable by a Unix sys admin type person.

* Discussion of comparisons between WWW and Gopher as well
   as other CWIS technology, both on a technical level and
   on a non-technical level.  For example:

   1) What functionality do you get from WWW that you don't
   get from the other cwis info systems?

   2) Are they competing or complimentary technologies?

   3) Why has Gopher caught in the Internet on while WWW has
   not?

   4) How can folks working on WWW make WWW more accessible
   to people who are not part of the High Energy Physics
   research area -- how to target a bigger audience so that
   if there is something worthwhile in WWW but not in
   Gopher, someone else beside me and a few others will know
   about it!


Clearly I think that WWW has more to opher than Gopher

(whoops, please forgive my spelling, I meant 'offer'!  ;-)

The request for discussion for comp.infosystems.www has been posted.
Please carry on all discussions about the newsgroup creation in
news.groups.

If it looks like there are going to be any major arguments (like about
the newsgroup name), we should take them off-line immediately, settle
them quickly, and resume the discussion, so that they don't delay the
creation of the newsgroup.

Someone from the DESY computer centre assured me
that this was the Hyper-FAQ to the WWW-wizards. I hope
to pass your kill-file nevertheless. [The same person
did not have any clue how to answer my question.]
     
I wanted to start a FAQ for one of the hepnet.* newsgroups.
Since the freeHEP server at freehep.scri.fsu.edu is tied to
WWW, and it also archives the hepnet hierarchy, my question
is: how do I format my FAQ in Hypertext?
     
	Besides the question, I also have an information to
give: on the faq-maintainers mailing list, there is a BIG
debate right now on standard formats for FAQs. The discussion
was started by Thomas A. Fine's posting to the list which I
repost here--though I don't assume that the WWWmasters haven't
heard about it. In the future, the project he outlines may be
the cheapest way of getting your FAQ into Hypertext, but right
now the possibility does not seem to exist.
     
I'd like to know what you guys think.

Subject: Converting FAQs to hypertext
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 93 20:55:55 -0500
     
     
I'm trying to develop a project which will convert FAQs into hypertext
documents under the World Wide Web system.  I have a specification,
which is included, for a standard format for FAQs such that they can
easily be translated into hypertext documents.  We will translate all
conforming FAQs at Ohio State, and make them available to the world in
hypertext.  I'd like to let everyone have a look at what I'm doing, so
you can point out problems before I go ahead and do it.
     
First I'd like to make certain things clear:
     
  * We can deal with more than one format.  If you find what I've done
    too restrictive, we can probably develop software that will turn
    your own format into hypertext.  I would encourage the development
    of several different formats, as long as "several" is substantially
    less than the total number of news.answers postings.
     
  * The development of additional formats and software is fairly easy.
    When the original concept was developed, I wrote perl scripts to
    convert comp.lang.perl and comp.unix.questions FAQs to hypertext
    (different software for each), in about 3 hours.  Software for
    the format I'm recommending was also fairly easy, although it has
    been tweaked on a fair bit, so it was more than three hours.
     
  * The format that I'm proposing is very flexible, IMHO.  It is designed
    for generic documents as well as lists of questions and answers.
     
  * My format preserves most of the text formatting of the original
    document.
     
  * I'm very open to suggestions, volunteers, etc.
     
  * I don't want to make conformance to ANY format a posting requirement.
    If you choose not to conform to anything, you just won't have your
    posting turned into hypertext.
     
  * If you know about WWW and want to supply your FAQ to us directly as
    hypertext, we can make arrangements for that.
     
  * Submission of FAQs to us will be through two different methods.  The
    most painless is post it to news.answers -- we'll scan it and
    convert anything we find that conforms (we may scan other
    newsgroups as well).  The other method will be to send us mail to
    <an address that hasn't been set up yet>.  This method will provide
    faster response that you might want if you are modifying your FAQ
    and want to see it in hypertext.
     
  * The conversion software will be available (this is a requirement for
    contributed software and formats).  Currently, we have software which
    converts a document, but we don't have any software for scanning news
    or catching mail.  Fairly trivial though.
     
Background
     
World Wide Web is a networked information retrieval system, with its own
hypertext documents at its base.  Even though WWW is still under development
much of it is already solid, and there are already several applications
and a nice amount of information available.  WWW can interface with both
WAIS and Gopher, and interfaces with other systems have been prototyped.
It is ideal as a local help system, as code already exists for converting
man pages, RFCs, emacs info documents, and lots of other things into
hypertext.
     
Currently, WWW only supports hypertext documents, although plans are being
made for a protocol which will deal with all MIME document types.  Lots
of other ideas are being passed around and there's still much to be done.
Volunteers are welcome.  There is a mailing list; subscribe via
www-talk-request@nxoc01.cern.ch.  Hopefully we will have our own newsgroup
soon.
     
What follows is several things in one:  It is a rough draft of what will
be posted monthly to news.answers describing this project.  It is a
description of the format.  And it conforms to the format, and therefore
serves as an example.  A formatted version is available if you grab the
software (information is available in the document).
     
I'd very much prefer that you look at the hypertext results before
commenting.  If you don't want to go through the hassle of compiling
the software, XMosaic is available in binary form (see below).

Last-modified: 1993/02/11
     
Statement of Intent
-------------------
     
FAQs are a wonderful resource, but hard to work through.  This project
is an attempt to unite the volume of information found in news.answers
and other newsgroups with The World Wide Web, a system for networked
information retrieval.
     
World Wide Web uses hypertext documents and a network transport
protocol to build a huge web of information all over the world.
Accessing documents is as easy as clicking on a mouse.  (there are
tty-based interfaces available too).  WWW (as we like to call it, for
obvious reasons) also knows how to talk to other services including
WAIS and Gopher.  There are plans to extend the document type to be a
MIME document, of which WWW's hypertext (called HTML, for HyperText
Markup Language) will be one part.
     
Since we don't expect everyone to learn HTML (although it is fairly
straight forward), we have designed a format that can be used for
news.answers (et. al) documents and FAQs which will allow us to
automatically convert them to hypertext.  The format has been designed
to allow FAQ maintainers to providing conforming news articles with
minimal changes.  Note that while this is currently the only format,
it is possible to support multiple formats.
     
The format is described in following sections.  Note that this article
itself conforms to the format, and a formatted version is available thru
the Web (See "Getting WWW Software").
     
Getting WWW Software
--------------------
     
To see what this document looks like after it's been formatted, grab
yourself some software and give it a try.  The software is available
via anon ftp from various places.  There are several different packages
available:
     
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Web/xmosaic
  xmosaic-0.7.tar.Z                X11 browser - fairly new, very nice.
				   (binary available in the dir binaries-0.7)
     
info.cern.ch in /pub/www/src
  tkWWW-0.4.tar.Z                  X11 browser - Tcl/Tk implementation
  viola920730.tar.Z                X11 browser - a bit out of date
  midaswww-1.0.tar.Z               X11 browser - new version expected soon
  WWWLineMode_1.3b.tar.Z           dumb terminal browser
  WWWNextStep_0.15.tar.Z           A NextStep browser and editor
  www_and_frame-0.2.tar.Z          A package for editing HTML with FrameMaker
  [my tty-based browser and editor will hopefully be included soon]
     
To find the FAQ stuff in the Web, you will need the following Universal
Resource Locator, which can be typed into your browser in an application
specific way (the XMosaic author promised to include a built-in link to
the information):
     
  "http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/faq/usenet/FAQ-List.html"
     
The hypertext documents produced from conforming FAQs uses few of the
features of html, and so will look rather plain looking.  If you would
like more information, start by getting the software and rummaging
around the web.  You can also get on the www-talk mailing list by
sending to www-talk-request@nxoc01.cern.ch.  Lastly, you could bug me
with mail if you were really desparate.  If after seeing what this
system can do, you decide you want to provide your documentation
directly as hypertext, contact me (fine@cis.ohio-state.edu) and we'll
work out the details.  Send questions about this format to the same.
     
The Header Format
-----------------
[Note that when "article" is used, a single article is being referred to.
 When "posting" is used, the entire set of articles are being referred to.]
     
In order to be recognized as a conforming article, it must use MIME
headers as follows:
     
For single-article postings, the header must include:
     
  Content-type: text/x-usenet-FAQ
     
In addition, two fields can be added to this line:
     
  version=1.0
     
This indicates the version number to process the file with.  If absent,
version 1.0 will be assumed.  The other field:
     
  title="The title of the article"
     
This will be used in various places in the conversion to hypertext.  If
not present, the subject line (in its entirity) of the first article
of the posting will be used as the title of that posting.  The posting
title must be unique.
     
Note that when attributes are used, semicolons should also be used
after the Content-type, and after each attribute except for the last:
     
  Content-type: text/x-usenet-FAQ;
	  version=1.0;
	  title="Blarg"
     
For multiple-article postings, the Content-type information as described
above should be the first thing found in the BODY of the first article
of the posting (it can be included in the secondary header with
Archive-name and Version lines found in many FAQs).  In addition, each
article header must contain the MIME multipart information:
     
  Content-type: message/partial;
	  number=1;
	  total=3;
	  id="totally-unique-id-string"
     
The "total" attribute is only required on the final part of the document.
The id will be the same for each article in the posting, but is supposed
to be guarenteed unique among postings.  A format similar to the typical
news message id is recommended, e.g. something including the poster and
the posting host along with an id unique to that host (the time).
     
The Body Format
---------------
The content is fairly free-form.  It can contain any of the following
"sections"
     
    Documents
    Ignored text
    Questions/Answers
     
The Ignored text is stripped out first, then the articles are appended,
together.  The converter then expects to see a series of "Documents"
and or "Questions/Answers" sections.  These are all described
below if you are in text, or are links at the top level, if you
are in hypertext.
     
These will be formatted into a top level hypertext document with links
to all the other documents.  The software will attempt to handle simple
subsets of this format accordingly; for instance if a posting consists
entirely of a single questions/answers section, the conversion will
show the list of questions as the top level of the hypertext (this
hasn't been implemented yet).
     
Each of the Documents or Questions/Answers sections must be started
with a blank line, a left-justified title line, and a left-justified
line of dashes to underscore the title.  The only exception is a posting
which is either a single document, or a single set of questions/answers,
in which case no such title is required anywhere.  Also, the first
section does not require such a title; if it is left out, the title
"Introduction" will be used.
     
Documents
---------
A document section is just any section of text, separated by the section
title described previously, and not matching the Questions/Answers form.
This means you must make sure no line in a document section starts with
a number followed by a right parenthesis.
     
This section on "Documents" you are reading now will be an entire
hypertext document after conversion (this may not be the best
choice for the hypertext layout, but makes a good example.)
     
Ignored Text
------------
Some text can be ignored in the posting.  Typically in news articles, you
may need to include some redundant text in every article, that won't be
needed in the hypertext.  Also some information, like how to unpack the
articles might be unneeded.  Lists of questions are another example, since
the conversion software builds this list from the questions themselves.
     
To mark text as uneeded, it should be surrounded by lines consisting only
of "--".
     
An example starts here:
--
This text won't show up in the hypertext.
--
That was the example.  Note that if you are looking at the hypertext, there
was nothing between the start and the end, because it was ignored.
     
Important note:  Text will stop being ignored at the end of each ARTICLE,
even if there is no ending "--".  (This can be used to  eliminate
signatures, since lots of people use the "--" there anyway.)
     
Questions/Answers
-----------------
Any section which contains a left justified number followed by a right
parenthesis and then white space will be treated as a Questions/Answers
section.  The number can contain several decimal points, so "1.4.11) "
is an acceptable starting string for a question.
     
The requirements for this section can be summed up as:
* There must be a blank line before and after each question.
* All answer text must be indented from the left margin.
* All questions must be have no indentation on the first line.
* All questions start with a number, a right parenthesis, and some whitespace.
     
There can be a section title for some portion of the questions.  It
must have no indentation, and must be preceded by blank line, and
followed by a blank line and then a question.  It cannot start with a
number!
     
Creating Additional Links
-------------------------
Anywhere where the string ``(See "document title")'' occurs, a link
will be created to that document if it exists.  This link is just
an example: (See "Questions/Answers").
     
If you are going to do this, make sure you refer to a document title
that is unique.  All non-unique references will be ignored.
     
Questions and Answers
---------------------
     
Section 1.  The Documents
     
1.1) What is the documents section for?
     
  For introductions to newsgroups, introductions to FAQs, and other
  postings of interest for a newsgroup that don't fall into the question
  and answer scheme.
     
1.2) What if I have only a single document (and no questions)?
     
  Then make sure there are zero or one document titles (a title line
  followed by a line of dashes), and nothing that looks like the start
  of a Question/Answer section.
     
     
Section 2.  The Question/Answer portion of the FAQ
     
2.1) What if my question is too
     long to fit on one line?
     
  Just make sure you don't put a blank line in the question.  The software
  will deal correctly.
     
2.2) How do you distinguish section titles from questions, if both
start at the beginning of the line?
     
  Sections titles can not start with numbers.  Questions have to start with
  a number, followed by a right parenthesis and then whitespace.
     
2.3) Where, exactly, should I put blank lines
     
  A blank line has to occur before and after each question.  Blank lines
  must also occur before each section title.  All other blank lines will
  be preserved.
     
Section 3.  Other questions
     
3.1) Can I create additional links?
     
  Yeah, just put in text that looks like this:
     
      (See "Creating Additional Links")
     
  It must refer to a Document title or Q/A title somewhere in the posting.
     
3.2) Can I do tree structuring?
     
  The format is converted into a three level tree, but you can't impose
  any other structure on it, unless you want to provide your documentation
  directly as hypertext.
     
3.3) What if I don't like your format?
     
  Come up with your own.  We may even help you write the software to convert
  it.  Since the format requires a version number, its easy for us to support
  multiple versions at the same time.
     
  If you do decide to create your own format, it would be best if it would
  be general enough for more than your own postings, as we think it would
  be a little cumbersome having a separate piece of software for every
  different posting.
     
3.4) Since this uses MIME headers, will there be an application
     to read such documents with a MIME news/mail reader?
     
  Eventually, but not now.
     
3.5) Why didn't you use SeText format?
     
  Because we wanted to get this done quickly, and SeText isn't a fully
  realized standard yet.  Also, its not clear that SeText will handle
  all the functionality we needed.  It is possible that future versions
  will be based on SeText, or at least include some of its features.
     
  BTW SeText is a pseudo-markup language for text documents.  All the
  markups are chosen as items which won't interfere with the reading
  of the document in an unformatted state.  Neat stuff, but not ripe
  yet.

Ha!  You can't get rid of me.  Well, I'll answer your question, and
then for all the WWW people out there, I'll give a project status.

The software to handle the format I posted already exists.  If you
want to conform to that, you can do that, and I can send you the software.

Or you can rummage through the web and figure out how to format things
yourself.  It's not a huge amount of material, but there are some finer
points you have to know.

Or you can wait until I finish my editor.  At this rate, who knows when
that will be.  I haven't had time to work on it in a month, even though
it is 90 percent complete.  It certainly won't be until after I get
the FAQ stuff relatively settled (see below).

Well, I sent my proposed format to the faq-maintainers mailing list to
see what sort of reaction I would get.  Ouch.  Not all bad though.  Some
people may choose to use my format.  At any rate, many people pointed
me at the digest format, while other unsubscribed from the mailing list.
:-)   :-(

The digest format is a format for encapsulating lots of little articles
into one big article.  It was designed for mailing lists (See RFC 1153).
Its use for FAQs is dubious at best (each question becomes a separate
article).  At any rate no one conforms precisely (or in the ballpark)
to the standard.  And 90 percent don't try to use it at all.  Still that
seems to be the direction people are going.

So, I'm working up some conversion software that will deal with their
whimsical excuse for the Digest format.  It will buy me about 30-40
FAQs right off the bat, and hopefully help sell the idea.

One of the things NCSA is interested in as part of our Mosaic work (of
which X Mosaic is only the first result) is gathering and analyzing
sociological data corresponding to use of distributed information
systems as well as use of the tools used to access those information
systems.

To make a long story short, in the name of Real Academic Research
(involving simulations and analysis that will be run on our Connection
Machine 5, if that makes it sound more impressive), we're thinking
about building logging mechanisms into the Mosaic tools that track a
number of interesting information access parameters:

        which documents are visisted
        how long each document is visited
        how many times each document is visited
          ... and in what sequence
        how hyperlinks are used
        how multimedia features are used
        how search features are used
        (in the future) how intelligent assistance is used
          ... and how it is not used
        etc.

First, this would be entirely voluntary -- when you start Mosaic for
the first time, you would get a registration screen that, among other
things, would let you either say, ``Yes, I Want To Help NCSA'', or
``No NCSA, Stay Out Of My Cyberspace''.

Second, this would be entirely under user control -- it could be
turned off at any time, via a menu option and/or X resources and/or
whatever other methods we can come up with.  (Or, if data accidentally
gets collected and sent to us when you didn't want it to, drop us a
note and we'll purge it from our systems.)

Third, it would be entirely automatic in that the log reports would be
sent, via email, by the program without the user having to do
anything.

Fourth, all information would be held in the strictest confidence --
it would go right to the project's social scientists and stay on
secure machines inside NCSA; even I (your humble hacker) would
probably never see it.  We'll swear to this on a stack of religious
texts of your choice.  Data will, of course, someday be published in
the generalized, analyzed aggregate -- but there will be no way for
anyone to trace back anything to any user anywhere.

Fifth, and this is the best part -- cooperating with us on this and
helping us gather this data would essentially mean more support for
the Mosaic project, enabling us to build more and better tools for
you.  And, the information we learn from the analyzed data will be fed
back into our development -- a particularly exciting concept for us,
because we want to start building intelligence into the systems, and
we need this type of analysis to have something to build on.

So... what do you think?  Should we do it?  Should we not do it?  Will
anyone rebel and refuse to use our software outright?  Given the
parameters outlined above (esp. the completely voluntary & under user
control parts), could it still be considered to be an invasion of
privacy, or possibility thereof?  Does it make you hopping mad to even
think that we'd consider it?  What?

Thanks for your help,
Marc

Subject: Logging user access. Was: a question...
Cc: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch



Logging user access is something which we definitely want ..for a  
number of reasons

	-  Justifying the project by showing statistics
	-  Demonstrating the readership profiles of 

		different material
	-  Demonstrating the usage profile across sites
	
The privacy issue is very important, and so I had intended to
log each action "A read B" as "A read something" and "B was read"
independently.  This would give the basic profiles.  Anything futher  
would be an infringement of privacy, so yes that the user would
have to agree to it. The problem is, then the sociological data would  
be immediatly filtered ... all the alt.sex.bondage readers would
filter themselves out!  Perhaps two levels are needed.

The network load is also something which I considered a possible  
problem, so I decided on a scheme (have I said this before?) in which
an event was logged with probability p=exp(-a*t) and the probability
p is included in the message so that the message can be given weight  
1/p in the analysis. The time t with which p decays is from  
compilation of the source, so you get more fine-grained
info on the new releases.
The messages would be UDP packets so as not to clog gateways.

We have a monitoring service here which is already monitoring the use  
of other CERN software -- I am not sure whether it is tcp or udp  
based.  


*Coincidence:*  As I write the file system on our server has JUST  
filled up in attempting to process server January's log data....
is this a warning?!

BTW: Marc, you were going to log how LONG an article was read for.
I think that is very tricky... if you can come up with a good measure
of how much the person LIKED the article (automatically) then you
will really have something.  Someone whose name I forget in Stockholm
just gave a talk about inferrding document affinities from readership  
profiles... using the user  as a more refined text comparison program
than a work occurence engine.  I suggested WWW usage data as source,
but realized that for example of all the talk I had just given with
XMosaic, the document which was left on the screen for the longest  
time was quite irrelevant.

Something linked with this is finding relevant material for
a particular person.  How about a service which takes someone's
global history file and tells them all that's new in the world
which would interest them?  In other words, if you do keep
data about a particular person, then that can help them find more  
data like it.... a sophisticated form of relevance feedback.
 

 - - -
 

I think that as you are collecting data from the public, then the
data should also be made available to the public, with names and
addresses removed.

Another possibility is that all servers keep logs and share the
results... but it will always be incomplete.

... I made the long story even shorter.

This brings up an even better point than statistics.  There should be
built in mechanisms that will allow a user to respond directly to
the information provider.  This provides many benifits.  The first one is
that this is a nice way to correct typos, and other obvious errors that can
go unnoticed to the provider.  When a viewer sees a mistake he/she can
dash off a little note/flame informing the provider of the mistake.  This
is alot simpler than finding out the site and sending to an administrator.

Secondly, a user may wish to make a suggestion or ask for additional
information from the provider.  If they could send a note to the person
-directly- responseble for the information it would be much more likely
that they would get a meaningful reply.

Another useful feature is mailing error reports to an information provider
if they have an invalid link or if a site is unavailible.  This would
be done automatically by the client.  This provides useful data for
debugging a hypertext network and providing statistics for site availibility.

These features are built into the Lynx hypertext browser and have proved
to be VERY useful.  Document owners are listed inside of the hypertext 
file and are used as the address of comments and error reports.

Comments?

Subject:  new www interface for vms systems

Hi,

I am working now on a new interface for the www.

The interface is both english and hebrew (it can also be french and english)
It is written for a VMS system with smg screen functions.

The base of this interface is the linemode 1.4 with some improvements i have
made to the source.

there are still some bugs which i am working on...
and I hope to release the first version in july 1993.

You can try it out, by telnet to vms.huji.ac.il username: NEWWWW

For more information or suggestions please contact me.

thanks

Subject: xmosaic experience

I had an unsettling experience last night.  I wanted to look at the
latest draft of an Internet RFC, and thought to myself, ``Why not use
this nifty xmosaic tool to fetch it?'', since I had recently discovered
xmosaic.  So I typed in a URL, and it core-dumped on me.  Well, it's
only version 0.8, and probably doesn't know everything yet, so I tried
going through a gopher gateway (still using xmosaic) and accessing it
that way.  Well, I got through to the RFC -- and suddenly my X server
started chewing up CPU.  After chugging for several minutes (X11R5 on a
Sparc-2 with 48MB of RAM), xmosaic puts up the text of the RFC, marked
``page 1 of 5''.  Huh?  Surely this document has about 50 pages?

Turns out xmosaic has this (to me, fatally flawed) design decision I
hadn't suspected.  Instead of using a text widget (I'm not familiar with
the capabilities of the Motif text widget, but perhaps it does not
handle multi-font, multi-color text), xmosaic seems to *paint* text
strings on a window, and then pan the window around when the user
scrolls, rather than re-drawing the text.

Fascinating.

You are correct that the Motif text widget does *not* handle
multi-font, multi-color text.

Did you read the explanation for the "document pages" feature (or
fatally flawed design decision, whichever) in the docs, for which a
hyperlink is especially set up right by where it says "Document Page 1
of 5"?  Apparently not.  Let me summarize.

The X Window System has this (to me, fatally flawed) design decision I
hadn't suspected.  X windows can only be so big.  Up to the size of a
16-bit integer, in fact, in pixels.  This is really really bad.  This
means that the other WWW X browsers (at least Viola and Midas, the
only two I've been able to get working) will *not* correctly handle
documents that, when layed out, take up more pixels in height than

And another thing.

No doubt it doesn't know everything yet, but it's not going to get any
smarter if core dump reports don't come with a description of what
happened to cause the core dump.  Could you please provide the URL you
used to cause it to coredump?

Regarding Bill Jansen's experience, I read in his message a question
that you haven't answered but which perhaps lies at the core of his
complaint: the way I read it, he believes that you write the text
*once* into a background pixmap and then scroll it around.  I can't
believe this is true.  If indeed it isn't true you should perhaps
explain why it takes so long to read the RFC in (is it just slow ftp
or are you doing lots of processing?) and whether it is true that the
X server should be chewing up CPU?  Could it be that Bill's server is
too eager to do backing store and generates an exposure event for the
entire subwindow?  (Perhaps Xmosaic can set a resource that disables
this behavior?)

It's not storing a huge window-sized pixmap -- that would take one
hell of a lot of memory.  It's letting the X window mechanism generate
appropriate expose events and repainting on the fly.  Parsing a
document that long and finding out how to break it up into document
pages just plain takes a while -- but, for what it's worth, it will
take less time in 0.9, for reasons I'm not even going to go into here.

Relax, Marc.  First off, I really like xmosaic, and am hoping version
1.0 will be really great!  But secondly, I'm not your customer.  Who
cares what I think?  Thirdly, it *is* a design decision, probably made
for all kinds of reasons I'm not aware of which make it a *good* design
decision.  Fourth, of course I read your explanation.

Well, since you ask...  If you're displaying text, it really doesn't
matter what the maximum size of a window is, so long as you can get at
least one line on it, right?  As the user scrolls through the text, you
just show different lines, right?  But apparently what you're doing is
turning each document into a giant image of text, and then panning
through that image, which of course runs you into size problems.  This
is an OK idea if you're building something like HyperCard.  But WWW
isn't always like HyperCard, it tends to mix the ``holy scroller'' model
with the ``card shark'' model of hypertext.  So this approach isn't
really suited either to WWW or to the X Window System, so far as I can
see.  (The problem with it on X is that is uses big chunks of window
system resources, typically in one big burst that locks out everything
else on the screen!)  The ``correct'' approach would be more of what
Viola does, which is to use a text widget.  By the way, Viola, the only
other browser I use, *does* in fact use a text widget, and handles my
document just fine.

As I said above, maybe I'm missing something?

It's good to hear that.  Public complaints about something that we
actually put a lot of time into don't encourage us any, though.  I'm
sure you can understand that.

> But secondly, I'm not your customer.  Who cares what I think?

Well, you literally are our customer.  But that's probably beside the
point... we do care what you think simply because having the wonderful
distributed beta team that we essentially have due to this group gives
us the opportunity to make our product much better than it could be
otherwise.  We very much value constructive criticism from
knowledgeable people.

We are using a widget.  A text widget, in fact -- just one we wrote
ourselves, since the Motif text widget doesn't support the
functionality we need.  We are not using a huge-ass 32K or 64K pixel
high pixmap or image, and we are not consuming memory to store such a
pixmap or anything else 32K or 64K high.  We are using a virtual
window that is that high because that way X handles the scrolling such
that we get the proper expose events at the proper times FOR THE AREA
OF THE WINDOW THAT IS ACTUALLY ONSCREEN.  To do our own scrolling
would require a lot of additional work.  Either someone funds us to do
that work or we are going to do more interesting things with our time.

Spend some time with our code before drawing conclusions, in public no
less, like ``you're turning each document into a giant page of text,
and then panning through that image''.

OK, if that's the case then my apologies to Pei.  I have a dim memory
of trying this last year and simply seeing the document overrun the
window size, as happens with Midas -- I'm probably mistaken.

Actually, I don't think it's a pixmap.  What every X text widget I'm
aware of does, is this:  It puts up a single window, and figures out
what lines of the text to paint in that window.  When the user scrolls
the text, it re-figures the lines, and repaints the window.  Thus it can
handle text of arbitrary length, with relatively small use of X Window
resources, even if backing store is enabled; in fact, backing store
works well with this scheme.

What I think xmosaic does is:  it creates both a fixed window as above,
then creates a huge-ass window as a child window.  It connects the
scrollbar to the child window, and allows the user to scroll the child
window around, instead of scrolling the text around.  This is a *much*
simpler way of doing things, but now X *will* allocate an internal
backing pixmap for that child window, even without backing store, and
without all of it being exposed.  So you're using one huge amount of
memory.  And this is just to avoid using the Motif text widget?  As I
say, this kind of approach would work OK on X for a HyperCard-like
system, but not for a scrolling system.

Hmmm, the document was plain text.  Where's the parse?  And of course if
you didn't have to break it into document pages...

Explain to me how we are able to allocate a 32K * 1024 * 1 byte pixmap
or image or block of random memory or whatever it is you claim we're
doing and still fit in on a typical workstation.  For example, I
currently have that situation running within X Mosaic on my 24MB
workstation and not only is scrolling almost instantaneously fast but
ps -lef reports this:

30 S   marca 22431 12382  0  26 25 * 1123:680  80127908 18:24:21 ttyq1     0:16 /usr/people/marca/mosaic/xmosaic/sr

Where in there is that 32MB of memory buried?

And look, goddammit, we are not trying to avoid using the Motif text
widget.  The Motif text widget is not capable of supporting colors and
fonts.  You show me how to put colors and fonts in a Motif text
widget, or support the rest of the functionality we need, and I'll
damn well do it.

The parse is because I switched to using <xmp> in 0.8 to support
annotations to plaintext documents (since <xmp> can be terminated and
<plaintext> cannot).  In 0.9 this will be handled as it should be and
<plaintext> will be used again, obviating the need to do a lot of the
parsing that's going on right now.  But we're still going to be using
a Widget and we're still not going to be using the Motif text widget
and we're still going to have the document pages feature in there.

I finally looked at the X11R5 server source, and you're absolutely
right, the server is not allocating more than a screen-size of pixmap
for any one window, even a very big one.  Most of that time I was
looking at must have been spent parsing (but then why did `ps' show it
in the server?).  Thanks for correcting my misapprehension on that point.

Because the Widget uses XTextExtents to figure out how big text chunks
are (which makes sense, since they could be in any font).  Like I say,
this should be faster in 0.9, since it won't have to do so much
parsing, since I will be handling plaintext documents correctly, since
annotation links will be handled separately from the document text
itself.  I think.

Subject: proposed new tag: IMG
X-Md4-Signature: 290e31aa16432f2a9a2423a649f18b33

I'd like to propose a new, optional HTML tag:

        IMG

Required argument is SRC="url".  

This names a bitmap or pixmap file for the browser to attempt to pull
over the network and interpret as an image, to be embedded in the text
at the point of the tag's occurrence.

An example is:

        <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/foo/bar/blargh.xbm"> 

(There is no closing tag; this is just a standalone tag.)

This tag can be embedded in an anchor like anything else; when that
happens, it becomes an icon that's sensitive to activation just like a
regular text anchor.

Browsers should be afforded flexibility as to which image formats they
support.  Xbm and Xpm are good ones to support, for example.  If a
browser cannot interpret a given format, it can do whatever it wants
instead (X Mosaic will pop up a default bitmap as a placeholder).

This is required functionality for X Mosaic; we have this working, and
we'll at least be using it internally.  I'm certainly open to
suggestions as to how this should be handled within HTML; if you have
a better idea than what I'm presenting now, please let me know.  I
know this is hazy wrt image format, but I don't see an alternative
than to just say ``let the browser do what it can'' and wait for the
perfect solution to come along (MIME, someday, maybe).

Let me know what you think.........

Cheers,
Marc

I have something very similar in Midas 2.0 (in use here at SLAC, and due for 
public release any week now), except that all the names are different, and it 
has an extra argument NAME="name". It has almost exactly the same 
functionality as your proposed IMG tag. e.g.

<ICON name="NoEntry" href="http://note/foo/bar/NoEntry.xbm">

The idea of the name parameter was to allow the browser to have a set of 
"built in" images. If the name matches a "built in" image it would use that 
instead of having to go out and fetch the image. The name could also act as a 
hint for "line mode" browsers as to what kind of a symbol to put in place of 
the image.

I don't much care about the parameter or tag names,  but it would be sensible 
if we used the same things. I don't much care for abbreviations, ie why not 
IMAGE= and SOURCE=. I somewhat prefer ICON since it imlies that the IMAGE 
should be smallish, but maybe ICON is an overloaded word?

I was proposing to use the file extension (.xbm above) to tag what format the 
image was in, but with the intention that in future, when HTTP2 comes along, 
the same format negotiation technique would be used to access images.

Xbm and Xpm sound resonable to me, but do they sound reasonable for non-X 
based applications??

While we are on the subject of new tags, I have another, somewhat similar tag, 
which I would like to support in Midas 2.0. In principle it is:

<INCLUDE HREF="...">

The intention here would be that the second document is to be included into 
the first document at the place where the tag occured. In principle the 
referenced document could be anything, but the main purpose was to allow 
images (in this case arbitrary sized) to be embedded into documents. Again the 
intention would be that when HTTP2 comes along the format of the included 
document would be up for separate negotiation.

An alternative I was considering was:

<A HREF="..." INCLUDE>See photo</A>

I don't much like adding more functionality to the <A> tag, but the idea here 
is to maintain compatibility with browsers that can not honour the INCLUDE 
parameter. The intention is that browsers which do understand INCLUDE, replace 
the anchor text (in this case "See photo") with the included document 
(picture), while older or dumber browsers ignore the INCLUDE tag completely.

Comments?????

Wrong.  X does NOT allocate pixmaps just because you create a giant
window.  It remembers the size of the window and gives you expose
events when parts of the window become visible.  It does not even
allocate a pixmap for the visible part (since that's put directly in
screen memory).  What do you think exposure events were good for if
the server allocated a pixmap?  Soure that would be getting the worst
of two worlds!

I'll let Marc answer your attacks on XMosaic, but your knowledge of X
is less than what I expected.

First of all, excuse me for jumping into this discussion all of the
sudden, but I couldn't resist. Being one of the members of the former
Erwise-team, I have some ideas about X-browsers (Erwise is a Motif-based
www-browser, implemented as a student project at Helsinki University
of Tech. during 91-92)

Well, unless we'll be seing >32k*32k displays in the near future, it's
not that bad.

Erwise works correctly ;)
Actually, doing the scrolling by hand (even in an optimized way) isn't
that hard, you might want to take a look at our code (available at
anonymous@nic.funet.fi:pub/unix/hypertext).

Yes, I know, the code is something of a mess, especially since we
hacked a bit on the common code to get non-blocking transfers working
(it's nice to be able to retrieve multiple documents at the same time
and read through the ones on your screen, though).

Hmmmh, no offence, but I think that's not not the correct way to solve
the problem.

Btw, have the current x-clients implemented non-blocking transfers?
It should be implemented in the common code, maybe it already is. It's
really too bad that we don't have the time to support erwise (three
of us are working almost full time at a software company, and try to get
on with our studies as well). Maybe in the summer ...

I had imagined that figues would be reprented as

<a name=fig1 href="fghjkdfghj"  REL="EMBED, PRESENT">Figure </a>

where the relation ship values mean

	EMBED		Embed this here when presenting it
	PRESENT		Present this whenever the source document
			is presented
	
Note that you can have various combinations of these, and if
the browser doesn't support either one, it doesn't break.

A see that using this as a method for selectable icons means nesting  
anchors.  Hmmm.   But I hadn't wanted a special tag.
Annother way would be to declare an entity with SYSTEM attribute  
giving the URL and then invoke that entity, but that would mean an
extendable entity dictionary which is not currently needed.

I would like to reraise an issue I have mentioned before but not obtained a 
clear answer on. 

At SLAC we are using WWW as a means of accessing a set of High Energy Physics 
databases maintained here (SPIRES). One common usage is to search for 
particular particle types, for example PI+. There is an immediate problem in 
that the + symbol is treated specially in search strings by the current 
http-daemons, namely it is changed to a space (for largely historic reasons).

I would like to propose the following:

======

ALL browsers should perform the following translations on search strings typed 
in by the user:

   + " % and <space> should be replaced by %nn  where nn is  the ASCII         
                            code for the translated character 

ALL daemons should translate %nn in search strings back to the appropriate 
character. For historical reasons the + should continue to be translated to
<space> as now.

======

Comments????? Can we do it tomorrow?

Tony

I like the functionality of Marc's proposal.  (I am indifferent
to the syntax, so long as we get a standard.)  While I daresay
that HTPP2 and Mime will oneday achieve the same power and more,
I like the idea of getting it soon.

Note that Tim's proposal

<a name=fig1 href="fghjkdfghj"  REL="EMBED, PRESENT">Figure </a>

is less general, since it can only be used inside anchors.  (Maybe
I don't understand it, though... do you have to click on the
anchor, or does PRESENT mean that it is "automatically" clicked?
If so, what happens to the text between the A and /A ?

As I understand it, I can use Marc A's scheme for inline pictures
(which might be big) or icons in anchors.

As for specifics of Marc A's proposal, two comments

1) why have SRC instead of HREF?

2) It would be nice if there was a way to specify the content type,
e.g. 

<IMG HREF="http://nsa.gov/pub/sounds/gorby.au" CONTENT-TYPE=audio/basic>

But I am completely willing to live with the requirement that I specify
the content type by file extension.  It's good enough for me.

I'm sorry about this .. why not grab XMosaic or www and run it on  
your rs6000?  There is something which never works when telnetting
to a next from an rs6000 (www apart) which I don't want to tangle  
with now.  (One of my hariest days was trying to debug a NeXT when  
all I had was an rs600 to access it from!)

You could also try out another telnet server -- there's  a list in
the W3 FAQ which you can't read because it all comes in columns
1 and 80 ... ;-)

Tim --

I still have the problem I signalled 6 or 8 months ago, i.e., if i
telnet to info.cern.ch from an rs6k, the result is garbage:  Most of
the output is written to columns 1 and 80.  At that time, someone  
said,
yes, it was an error.  But from where?  Anything to be done?

Thanks in advance -- John

P.S. for Bebo -- Wonder if you see this at SLAC, where you use  
rs6k's.

No ... it is just that the thing is seen as a type of link rather
than something totally new. Note that in the Microsoft world the
work "Link" always mean "embed the thing referred to here" --
this explains much of the confusion when explaining W3 to windows
users.

If you consider that often the reader (rather than the author) might
want to chose which figues are expanded inline rather than put in a  
separate window, and also that the reader (rather tham the author)
might want to chose whether related things are PRESENTed  
automatically or not,  then the use of <A> with switches looks
more appropriate. As Tony points out, an advantage is that it will
be handled relatively well by browsers which can't do it or
old ones which don't understand it.

You didn't quite but you do now.  yes ... PRESENT means  
CONSIDER-THIS-CLICKED.
> If so, what happens to the text between the A and /A ?


It is replaced by the object because of the EMBED relationship.

If you allow an image, then suppose we also allow some content which  
includes anchors with x,y coordinates within the image. Then the
document can intercept mouse clicks and allow hypergraphics

I don't want to change HTML now if I can help it, until it has gone
to RFC track

While images are at the top of my list of desired medium types in a
WWW browser, I don't think we should add idiosyncratic hooks for media
one at a time.  Whatever happened to the enthusiasm for using the
MIME typing mechanism?  I made a concrete proposal a few months ago,
where HREFs can point to other parts in a MIME multipart (and thereby
to an "external-body"), and I've seen a similar idea recently regarding
embedding media clips in a "simplemail" format.  Don't we want to
take on something like this in HTML2?

I have added some code to httpd to allow a filter to be run when 
a file with a certain extension is requested. 
The patches are on ftp.cs.few.eur.nl, file pub/www/Daemon0.9b.patch.
Here's the start of that file;

The patches add a generic conversion facility to the HTTP daemon.
The syntax of the httpd.conf file has been extended to include a 
'convert' entry. Below is a piece of our httpd.conf file:

	convert	info		/usr/pkg/www/bin/info2html
	convert	man		/usr/pkg/www/bin/man2html

'info' and 'man' are the file extensions and '/usr/pkg/www/bin/...'
are the filters that should convert the document to HTML.
The filter is called with the document name from the reference
as its only argument.

Note that the daemon code has the following extensions hard coded
so they can not be used with this facility:
	.html .rtf .tar .hqx .Z

If the daemon has been updated with this code and the filters
have been installed in the right directory, references like
'http://host/man/csh.man' or 'http://host/info/gcc.info' should
trigger the execution of the appropriate script and convert the
requested document to HTML format.

It is handy to create some mappings for the new document types
so references don't depend on the exact location of the documents
in your filesystem;

	map	/info/*		/usr/pkg/gnu/info/*
	#
	# map various man-page categories to directories:
	#
	map	/man/gnu/*	/usr/pkg/gnu/man/*
	map	/man/lang/*	/usr/lang/man/*
	map	/man/local/*	/usr/local/man/*
	map	/man/openwin/*	/usr/pkg/openwin3.0/man/*
	map	/man/newsprint/*	/usr/pkg/newsprint1.0/man/*
	map	/man/X/*	/usr/local/X11R5/man/*
	map	/man/*		/usr/man/*

The info2html and man2html filters are in the same directory
on our ftp server as this patch (host ftp.cs.few.eur.nl, directory
pub/www).

The sample conversion filters are written in Perl so you'll need the
perl program (available from archive sites all over the world);
make sure that the first line of the filters is correct
(/usr/local/bin/perl may not be the location of the perl
binary at your site).

Sounds like a good idea -- we should have a list of more-or-less
standard names, then.  Which ones are you using?

Yup.  BTW, someone mentioned ``what happened to MIME'' -- this isn't a
substitute for the upcoming use of MIME as a standard document
mechanism; this provides a necessary and simple implementation of
functionality that's needed independently from MIME.

It is bad, because X's "virtual" window concept is a very convenient
way of doing things, and because the decision to chop pixel
coordinates to 16 bits is completely arbitrary -- Xlib in fact allows
you to pass in 32 bits, but this gets truncated to 16 bits by the time
the server gets it.  It's just plain silly that it's not 32 bits all
the way through.

I agree that ideally we should be doing the scrolling ourselves, but
like I said, that has a number of concomitant effects that we're not
willing to accept right now.

I sure would like to have non-blocking I/O... I have looked at the
Erwise code for this, and am thinking about stealing a lot of your
changes, but haven't had time yet......

Actually, in Mosaic this will be possible by doing something like:

<A HREF="http://nsa.gov/pub/sounds/gorby.au"><IMG SRC="myimage.xbm></A>

I absolutely agree in all cases -- my purpose in suggesting IMG is
that things are reaching the point where some browsers are going to be
implementing this feature somehow, even if it's not standard, just
because it's the logical next step, and it would be great to have
consistency from the beginning -- so that when HTML2 comes along,
we're all still in lockstep.....

Wait a minute -- let's temporarily forget about MIME, if it clouds the
issue.  My objection was to the discussion of "how are we going to
support embedded images" rather than "how are we going to support
embedded objections in various media".

Otherwise, next week someone is going to suggest 'lets put in a new
tag <AUD SRC="file://foobar.com/foo/bar/blargh.snd">' for audio.
There shouldn't be much cost in going with something that generalizes.

Actually, from having just looked at the viola code, I don't see that it
uses a text widget anywhere.  They have their own code to figure out the
visible text, and draw it each time.

How many X text widgets are you aware of?  Certainly the Motif Text widget
does NOT do what you describe.  The Athena Text widget does.  You have some
other text widget somewhere you are referring to?


As the author of the HTMLwidget (yes, it IS a widget, and you could link it
into either Athena or Motif and it will work with the other widgets) I 
suppose I should defend it a little here.

In general the criticisms of my design decision are correct, in specifics
they have all been wrong.  As I believe others have pointed out by now, your
X server is NOT allocating some huge chunk of memory.  Motif made the same
decision I did, and Athena did not.  There are many reasons behind the
decision, I will only mention one important one here that no one else has
covered yet.  I wanted my widget to work with other widgets sets
(specifically with either Athena or Motif).  In order to do the kind of
viewport scrolling Bill would like, the widget, has to know intimate details
about the internals of a second scrollbar widget which it is going to
display for scrolling.  This ties you to whatever widgets set's scrollbar
you end up using.

In the long run (xmosaic 2.0 or 3.0 if the project lasts that long) the
widget will be changed to do pretty much what Bill describes.  This will
tie it to the Motif widget set, and make it unusable in other widget
sets.  I personally dislike this because I disapprove of OSF's frequently
heavy handed methods, and don't like to see all my work benefitting them,
and only them, but other design decisions override my personal preferences,
and simple practicality forces the widget re-write.


As to the heated argument that seems to have resulted.  Sigh........
It would be nice if everyone double checked their facts before posting
them to thousands of people world-wide, but the majority of the people
on the net do not (including me at times).  This is unfortunate.

Marc,
	It seems to be human nature that if something works and they like
it, most say nothing.  But if they don't like it, most yell loudly. 
Someone once told me you can tell a software success by how many people 
were complaining, the more complaints, the more successful it was.  I
believe this is true.  So far we are in the envious position of receiveing
MORE praise than complaints.  Think a moment about how many happy quiet
people this means, compared to how few unhappy noisy people

Less than I expected, too  :-).

My, I hope I'm not causing anyone to commit suicide here...  I never
meant to ``attack'' XMosaic (which I like the general shape of), just
comment on some aspect of it (its scrolling system), which struck me as
unusual, and subject to some surprising restrictions, which I thought
others might enjoy knowing about.  Never mind :-)

Yup, yup... Since this is becoming an issue, I might as well mention 
that viola too has a number of bitmap tags, but for a DTD other than HTML,
because it'd be a mess to mix such things with the current HTML. At this
point, HTML should stay stable.

Yup, we obviously need to agree upon the namings, etc, from the start, 
or it's gonna be a sincere pain to converge later... I don't have any 
particular preference for the names/syntax, as long as there is some 
accounting for the format used (not by file extension, but preferably
by using MIME format identifiers).

Ok, so for HTML2 let's have something for inclusion.
I don't see any reason to limit it to images. Like
it could be more text or whatever.

SGML does provide an official way of doing this folks
and even if Dan C ain't here to round us up we maybe
ought to stick to the track.  It might have some useful
spinnoffs like people assuming that any SYSTEM attribute,
instead of being a "system defined" path for an
entity, would be a URI.

How about
<!ENTITY ICON6 SYSTEM "http://blah..">&ICON6;

True indeed! I want to consider a whole range of possible image/line art
types, along with the possibility of format negotiation. Tim's note
on supporting clickable areas within images is also important

Subject: Reading news via WWW browsers


A couple of suggestions on better ways of reading news via WWW browsers.

Disclaimer: The only browser I used so far is Viola.

1 - Most discussions in most newsgroups consist of threads. Someone starts a
    thread, others respond, and so forth. We are using here a newsreader called
    TIN (written by Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net) that whenever a news
    group in entered, it first indexes all the postings into threads, and then
    presents a view of the group traffic as a collection of threads.
    You pick a thread, and start from the first posting. The next posting you
    will get will be the next one along the thread.

    This approach lends itself very well to a hypertext browser. Using the 
    same indexing method as TIN, it will embed a link into the end of  each 
    article that will point to the next one in the thread, in addition to
    links in the beginning of the article that point to the previous article
    in the thread and to the start of the thread.

    Also having a menu of threads instead of a menu of postings at the
    news group entrance, makes the menu more compact and the access more 
    convenient.

    Again, the credit goes to Iain Lea and his newsreader is the best I have 
    seen so far.


2 - The newsreader part should in my opinion be part of WWW, not the browser.
    That way the effort will not be duplicated in each and every browser. In 
    the same way that WWW uses gophers and WAIS servers, it can use distributed
    news servers, that know how to feed it hypertext.

3 - Is there a way to read news groups not carried locally via the WWW ?
    We have here a rather limited selection on newsgroups (only 1500 or so :-)
    Some people are not that fortunate, and I know of many groups we do not
    carry either. Additionally, postings are kept here only for about 3 days.
    
    So - how about a facility to read news at the source?


4 - At least in viola there is no way to save locally a news article, thread
    or any remote file (sort of FTP it over). How about other browsers ?

    Do I have to go outside browser to bring it over, pick it with the mouse 
    from the screen or is there a way to do it from within?


I am new to this list, so please - hold your flame throwers.

Good idea!  I can't wait to see your code... :-).

(I agree that TIN is the best newsreader I've seen so far in terms of
threading, etc. -- would be a good place to steal code from, if it's
legal.)

Except these hypertext news servers don't exist yet.  Again, can't
wait to see the code... (also, would be a pain in the butt to get the
current NNTP servers moved over to the new code -- probably better to
just rely on existing servers until the whole news population moves to
the next level of functionality -- and who knows, maybe that will be
hypertext).

Well, there's no such thing even in the news world itself, so I don't
know how we can do any better...

Mosaic lets you save/mail/print the current document (article), in
HTML, plaintext, or formatted text.  I'm not up to date on the other
browsers anymore.

Yes, most of us here use the Notes interface, which maintains such threads
or "notes strings" as part of its database. The current NNTP news servers are
much too dumb for this - it takes far too many messages for the client to
work out the threads. You can do it, but it is painfully slow if your
NNTP server is on a remote machine.

Yes, I too have been thinking along these lines. The first step is an "agent"
program which runs daily to get the complete list of news groups, sorts them
alphabetically then builds them into a small group of html docs that allow
users to browse the newsgroup names hierarchically. The next step is to
extend the agent to build an html doc for each newsgroup's index. This
involves getting the headers for any new articles in that newsgroup and
can be linked to the job of tracking backward references, and updating a
database of threads/notes strings.

In the longer term, we can lobby for such support to be added into future
releases of the NNTP daemon. Our only hope in the short term is to build
agent processes that do the additional processing as a regular background
activity. You can think of these as a variety of "knowbots" which carry out
tasks that are impractical to perform on an interactive basis.

I am sure NEWS is due for a shakeup what with the arrival of MIME and html as
a registered format. The current restrictions on character sets and plain
text is rather cramping these days. Furthermore the number of newsgroups has
grown enormously over the last few years - the ability to carry popular
groups locally and to get the others on request from remote servers seems
long overdue.

I have been toying with an extension to the URL syntax for just this purpose:

        news://news.ysu.edu/alt.culture.*

This implies the list of newsgroups under alt.culture on the NNTP server
"news.ysu.edu".

        news://news.ysu.edu/alt.culture.usenet

This example specifies the newsgroup "alt.culture.usenet" as held on the
nntp server  "news.ysu.edu"

        news://news.ysu.edu/<C34u1w.7Ls@news.ysu.edu>

This specifies an actual news article from that newsgroup and server.

One outstanding problem is which machines archive what newsgroups? It is
often the case that the original article has been discarded from the local
server, and it would be really great if the browser could then try to get the
missing article from a remote archive system. The establishment of well known
servers for given groups would be a good start.

Best wishes

if i recall the html right, there was no way to specify that you read

a particular gopher or wais server.

the syntax if you could would look something like
  nntp://news.msen.com:119/news.groups			a newsgroup
  nntp://news.msen.com:119/news.groups/1114		article (by number)
  nntp://news.msen.com:119/1236INNuq@news.msen.com	article (by msgid)

Actually, maybe we should think about a general-purpose procedural
graphics language within which we can embed arbitrary hyperlinks
attached to icons, images, or text, or anything.  Has anyone else seen
Intermedia's capabilities wrt this?  It's one of their most impressive
capabilities, actually.

Something like a cross between PostScript and CGM might work...
actually, maybe we should just use one or the other, and add the
extensions we need for the links.  Also we'd want to make sure that
it's completely editable.

I agree.  I like the browsers be generic (although with some of
the new UI features being discussed) and not be burdened by
so many communication protocols.  Maybe even FTP should have
to go through a gateway WWW server.

I have a set of NetNews CD-ROMS from Sterling Software mounted in some
Pioneer CD-ROM changers.  They would make a reasonable news archive,
hooked up to a WWW server.  A full text index would be even better.  I am
looking into putting together such a server.

One problem is that Sterling is seriously behind in sending out the CD-ROMs.
I have not received any dated since August.  Too long a lag makes it less useful
as an archive for finding recently expired articles.  I'm even getting worried that
Sterling may discontinue the product (or go out of business).

Yeegh!  When we have unlimited-bandwidth networks, then we can do
that, but until then, going through a gateway for something as
ubiquitous as FTP would be a mistreak IMHO....

I was thinking of a "local" gateway at each site (or even on the local workstation).
This makes sense for our site because all our off-site FTP traffic has to go through
a security gateway anyway.

Actually I believe the www library already has an optional provision for this anyway.
By setting an environment variable like WWW_file_GATEWAY, all "file:" requests
can be redirected to a local server.  Does this still work?

In any case, I still hold that fancy features like threaded news should be
implemented in a server, not in the WWW clients.

X-Mailer: Perl Mail System v1.2


Here's my opinion.

The best way to do images in WWW is by using MIME.  I'm sure postscript
is already a supported subtype in MIME, and it deals very nicely with
mixing text and graphics.

But it isn't clickable, you say?  Yes your right.  I suspect there is
already an answer to this in display postscript.  Even if there isn't
the addition to standard postscript is trivial.  Define an anchor
command which specifies the URL and uses the current path as a closed
region for the button.  Since postscript deals so well with paths, this
makes arbitrary button shapes trivial.

Let's call this specially modified postscript HTPS.  Until HTPS becomes
some sort of standard, every copy of HTPS should include a piece of code
that asks the interpreter if it knows about the anchor command, and if
it doesn't it will substitute in a null command.

As far as implementation, this is easy, though not necessarily trivial.
Ghostscript already provides the ability to bind arbitrary functions to
mouse events.  It shouldn't be too horrible to set up anchor to keep
a table of button paths, and have mouse clicks call a function that looks
up what button they are in.

Let me point out that it wouldn't be hard to make such a system deal
with html too.  Many people already have code that converts html to
postscript.

It's perhaps worth noting that the newsreader in use at the Software
Technology Program of MCC in 1987-1990, written by Michael Begeman,
called `gnews', did this.  `gnews' was released into the public domain
several years ago, but I don't know where to get it from MCC these days.
 Looks like the code can be used in other things, as long as the credit
is preserved.  I've put a copy for ftp as
ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/transient/gnews.tar.Z.  It'll be there for
a couple of weeks.

Other systems to look at which have this (fairly valuable) notion are
Andrew and Slate.  Andrew is built with _insets_, each of which has some
interesting type, such as text, bitmap, drawing, animation, message,
spreadsheet, etc.  The notion of arbitrary recursive embedding is
present, so that an inset of any kind can be embedded in any other kind
which supports embedding.  For example, an inset can be embedded at any
point in the text of the text widget, or in any rectangular area in the
drawing widget, or in any cell of the spreadsheet.  Each ``embedding''
consists of some direct information which specifies the display area of
the embedded information, and a pointer to the actual data object
(actually, in most current usage the embedded data object is directly
contained, but references do in fact work).

This business about embedding the display information is interesting, as
it seems to contradict the standard separation of data and display so
pervasive in Andrew.  In Andrew text, embedded insets are thought of as
single characters in rather strange fonts, so the rectangular area
information tells the text display widget the size of the ``character''.
 Similarly for embedded insets in the drawing widget.

Subject: Internal links

I'm obviously not doing something right here.  I am using Mosaic, and
I have the following file called "test.html":

--begin
<T>Testing</T>
<H1><A HREF=#local>Hot Spot</A></H1>
Clicking on the words "Hot Spot" above should move the cursor to the
section below:
<P>
<H1><A NAME=local>Local Text</A></H1>
This is where the cursor should go to.
--end

but when I load it as a local file, it refuses to understand the
links.  It gets formatted okay, so it is being interpreted as an HTML
file, but the links aren't working.

When I click on a link, the file is redisplayed from the top of the
document.

This is most irritating :)

Any assistance would be gratefully appreciated (I have had the same
problem with the dumb-terminal client too).

Thanks,

in which I vote for (a) using MIME descriptions for multimedia stuff,

(1) X Mosaic 0.8 doesn't jump to internal links inside documents like
    it should anyway; this is already fixed for 0.9.
(2) X Mosaic 0.9 won't behave any differently with your document,
    unless you've got a really small window, since all of the text is
    already in the window and there's nothing to jump to -- anchor
    local is already being displayed.  And what's the "cursor" you're
    referring to?  Not the mouse pointer??

BTW, <t> isn't HTML.

What other behavior did you expect?

First important point is that with the new library, the
same software modules will be pluggable into clients or
servers. The local file reading in the client will be
the same as the file reading in the server. Same with newsm
so you can chose what you put into a gateway and what goes
straight into the client. And given that each module turns
out (TIN may be bigger) to be pretty small I know where I
will want the code -- I will want my client to be able
to handle anything without recourse to a gateway. (I have
more than 640k.)  But I also know that I'll want to set
up gateways for everything for situations like being
on the end of a phone line without SLIP, or being in
a .com like PARC which requires a gateway. 

If someone IS going to hack TIN into a news access module,
please merge it with the NEW one not the old -- WWWizards
can look at 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/HTNews.c
(the directory is browsable) but only for reference ..
don't build anyting till the files are all released.

BTW the line mode browser worked with the new library,
now I am putting in MIME parsing and HTTP2 so it is in peices again.

HTTP2 allows a document to contain any type which
the user has said he can handle, not just registered MIME
types. So one can experiment. Yes I think there is a case
for postscript with hypertext.
I don't know whether display postcript has enough.
I know Adobe are trying to establish their own postscript-based
"PDF" which will have links, and be readable by their
proprietory brand of viewers.

I thought that a generic overlaying language for anchors
(Hytime based?) would allow the hypertext and the graphics/video
standards to evolve separately, which would help both.

Let the IMG tag be INCLUDE and let it refer to an arbitrary
document type.  Or EMBED if INCLUDE sounds like a cpp include
which people will expect to provide SGML source code to be
parsed inline -- not what was intended.

URL is the term for something limited to an address. URI
means a URL OR something which looks like it but is a name
in an abstract space.  The IETF WG talks about URLs only as
no namespace exists.  [[The URI term has had a hard time as
noone accepts the concept of a (name or address) as some people are
so hot on defending the essential difference of names and addresses]]

Really?  A few months ago (Oct 92, version 1.3a I think)
a shortcut was introduced so that the
-source option pipes the source direct (CRLF and all) to stdout.
"Should work"!  It was particularly needed (and tested)
for postscript. Before, the source was treated as a plain text file,  
and wrapped at the line length.

Subject: WAIStoHTML daemon

Is it just me, or is the code and Makefile for this absolutely
knackered?  I'm on an SGI with irix 4.0.4 and I had to change some
prototypes, as well as add other .o files to the compilation in order
that things like logfile and HTclienthost be known to the world.

When I finally get it to compile, wsrc2html dumps core and ParseHTML
does diddly.  Not that I'm getting frustrated by this point, or
anything :-).

Does anyone have nice, simple code (translation: something that will
compile) for a server that will either deliver local WAIS databases as
accessed through WAIS: URLs, or will give the alleged WAISGate
functionality without the problems I am having?  Failing that, a
pointer to a more recent than 0.9a daemon and 1.1a library would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: NCSA Mosaic for X 0.9 released
X-Md4-Signature: 45ea884717beb8e4112219c5cdb83f79

Beta version 0.9 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, is hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/xmosaic-0.9.tar.Z

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DEC Ultrix.

Binaries for these platforms are available:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/binaries-0.9

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working binaries
are welcome.)  Documentation is available online, but is temporarily
out of date (I'll probably bring it up to date this weekend).  (Does
that look familiar yet???)

Changes since 0.8 include:

 o Some multimedia support. Yew asked for it...
    o GIF, JPEG, TIFF, audio, AIFF, DVI, MPEG, MIME, XWD,
      PostScript automatically recognized.
    o Pipe to external viewers (with viewers set via X resource
      mechanism).
    o Also retrieve images, audio over Gopher.
    o But not over HTTP (unless you're running a modified HTTP
      server).
    o Inlined MIME/multimedia support will be coming down the
      road, so this is all just a temporary hack.
 o Transparent handling of compressed (.Z) files.
 o Hotlist now *always* saved after modification.
 o Fixed occasional infinite loop/crash for some 8-bit documents.
 o Fixed various parsing bugs associated with using <xmp> instead of
   <plaintext> internally.
 o Links to specific anchors now work properly.
 o Fixed bug with failure in repeated accesses via FTP.
 o Fixed bug with spurious ^M's in Gopher anchors.
 o Fixed bug opening local file while visiting remote file.
 o Fixed display bug with punctuation falling off end of line.
 o Fixed problem with BadAlloc crashes on some servers.
 o Annotation text features.
    o Choice of annotation links in header or footer.
    o Automatic (& fast) updating of annotations on every document
      view.
    o New defaultAuthorName resource to override use of normal
      fullname.
    o Annotations now always use machine's full name.
 o Menubar item 'Delete This Annotation'.
 o Audio annotations (SGI only, so far).
 o Fixed BadWindow bug for annotation window on DECstations.
 o All plaintext files can now be annotated.
 o Fixed occasional problem with size of hotlist/history windows.
 o Added sample app-defaults files to distribution.
 o New resources for multimedia stuff:
    o gifViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o jpegViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o tiffViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o audioPlayerCommand (default 'showaudio' from Metamail
      distribution)
    o aiffPlayerCommand (default 'sfplay' -- SGI specific)
    o dviViewerCommand (default 'xdvi')
    o mpegViewerCommand (default 'mpeg_play')
    o mimeViewerCommand (default 'xterm -e metamail')
    o xwdViewerCommand (default 'xwud -in')
    o rgbViewerCommand (default 'ipaste' -- SGI specific)
    o postscriptViewerCommand
 o Deleted annotations now have all corresponding disk files removed.
 o Mosaic is smarter about the <plaintext> HTML token at the head of
   plaintext files.
 o Lots of little cleanups and bug fixes.

We're targeting a 1.0 release around the middle of March, so quick
feedback and bug reports will be GREATLY appreciated.

Finally, thanks *again* to everyone who's been contributing comments
and bug reports -- keep 'em coming!

Cheers,
Marc & Eric

Subject: new links

I am coming to appreciate how XMosaic keeps track of which links I
have traversed in a session, (although I also don't like it to keep
track across sessions) and it makes me want even more.

It would be nice the browser could somehow show me which links were
new, where new might mean either
 1) the anchor was not present in the document last time I saw it, or
 2) the document on the other side of anchor has changed.  Of course,
this is not easy!

The simplest way to achieve #1 is to have the client keep track, for
each document, of all the anchors in the document.  This would of
course increase the size of the data the client needs to keep track
of.

We can reduce the size of this data for those documents which adopt a
uniform naming convention for anchors, e.g. all anchors are
sequentially numbered and numbers are never re-used.  An alternative
would be to adopt the convention of annotating the anchor with the
time and date it was created, e.g. something like

<A HREF="http://wiretap.spy.com:70/clinton.phonebook"
   ANCHOR-CREATED-BY = "Boris Badenoff"
   ANCHOR-CREATED-DATE = "3 Mar 1993 12:00 est">

To achieve #2 is much harder, since, in general, a link has no way of
knowing when the target document has changed.  But sometimes a partial
solution is better than nothing.  A partial step would be to annotate
the link with the time and date that the target was modified, so that,
at least for those cases where you DO know the target has changed, the
client can notice that, e.g.

<A HREF="http://wiretap.spy.com:70/clinton.phonebook"
   TARGET-MODIFIED-DATE = "5 Mar 1993 1:00 est">

Subject: multimedia files over httpd
X-Md4-Signature: 2a57437c7fe621084fe8cdaa610a5778

Some people using NCSA Mosaic 0.9 have noticed that they can't put
multimedia files on their own httpd servers and retrieve them
correctly with Mosaic.  What's happening in most cases is that the WWW
Daemon is prepending <PLAINTEXT> to the head of those files.

The problem lies in HTRetrieve.c, line 180:

    if (*extension == '.') {
        return    0==strcmp(".html", extension) ? WWW_HTML
                : 0==strcmp(".rtf",  extension) ? WWW_RICHTEXT
                : 0==strcmp(".txt",  extension) ? WWW_PLAINTEXT
                : 0==strcmp(".tar",  extension) ? WWW_BINARY
                : 0==strcmp(".hqx",  extension) ? WWW_BINARY
                : 0==strcmp(".Z",  extension) ? WWW_BINARY
                : WWW_PLAINTEXT;        /* Unrecognised : try plain text */
    } else {
        return WWW_PLAINTEXT;
    }

...and line 295:

        /* Tell the client which format is to be sent */
        if (format == WWW_HTML) {
            status = read_file(soc, fd);
        } else {
            if (format==WWW_PLAINTEXT) {
#ifdef USE_PLAINTEXT
                HTWriteASCII(soc, "<PLAINTEXT>\r\n");
                read_file(soc, fd);
#else
                HTWriteASCII(soc, "<HEAD></HEAD><BODY>\r\n");
                HTSendPreformatted(soc, fd);
                HTWriteASCII(soc, "</BODY>\r\n");
#endif
            } else {
                HTWriteASCII(soc,
"Sorry, this document appears to be neither a plain text file nor hypertext file.\n");
                HTWriteASCII(soc,
"The current version of www does not yet handle multiple formats. Watch this space...\n");
                free(document_name);
                return fd;
            }
        }

Basically, if you hack this so it just sends back files with
unrecognized extensions (or some set of extensions that your server
would like to serve) without prepending anything, things will work.
The only gotcha I've found is that anything on the server without the
extension .txt will no longer be given a free ride as <plaintext> from
the server to the client.

An alternate solution is to put your images, sound files, etc. on your
anonymous FTP server or (shudder) your Gopher server and then point to
them at that location from your HTML documents.

Cheers,
Marc

This is a hack -- the suffix is NOT supposed to mean anything in HTTP
and there are servers which serve things with no suffix at all,
and have totally unfilelike names for objects. So beware.

Or use the not quite released Daemon 1.0 which will MIME-wrap them
according to HTTP2.  The

Sorry for the delay... I should answer [even] less mail :-}

To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Date: Fri, 5 Mar 93 12:10:35 CST
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]

There has been one or two messages that I have read hinting
about this capibility but none that I have seen stating
very clearly that an rlogin type is needed.  So now I'm 
saying it.  How about an rlogin type.  This would look
very similar to telnet type.

rloginaddress
    rlogin://[user@]hostport

hostport
    host[:port]

host
    hostname | hostnumber

user
    xalphas

If a client cannot process an rlogin then it can be treated as
a regular telnet type.  This is basically just a convienence
routine, saving the user from typing in a username.  I wouldn't
request this if it wasn't so easy to implement.

Well how about it???

This is bringing the security problem down on the knowledge of the
user, which has never been a good idea (otherwise, password systems
would _work_).  If the users don't understand what a command does, some
will never execute them (which is admittedly no worse than the current
situation), and some will always execute them, which doesn't provide
any security.  I can see the neophytes looking at the box that popped
up with some gibberish, and saying that the Web is too complicated,
and then going back to gopher ;-)

Also, this will be extremely client specific.  There's no advantage in
including the same extension in non-unix clients, as the exec will not
work in (say) VMS or MS-DOG.  I'd like to see clients converge
towards a standard (or at least, have a standard converge towards
the clients), but this is not possible if URL's will only be useful
for one OS.  It would also be annoying to maintain a different Web for
different clients.

You could probably make it work by designing a meta-language, that
could be implemented by each client.  This way, you can build the
security in from the start, and not worry about unknowledgeable
users.

It's a mammoth security problem in general, don't you think?  Asking
the user whether or not to execute a command absolves you of
responsibility for the results, but the results could still be
catastrophic.

Hi,

I finally understandd the problem with xmosaic not always being able
to make ftp connections.
Some systems managers demand a full email address as password for
an anonymous ftp connection.
Just user@ is not sufficient.
To overcome this problem ANON_FTP_HOSTNAME has to be defined in libwww/HTFTP.c.

Subject: printing WAIS documents

Viola uses the line mode browser to convert html documents to
text. In doing it for WAIS documents, I encounter two problems:

1 - the URL of those documents contain ";" telling the shell that
    the instruction ended. you ahve  to go out of viola, and enclose
    it in quotation marks.

2 - Even after doing that, I get a message saying:

    "Fatal Error:  Returned message too large"

Is the documnet to long for the line mode browser, or is the URL to long ?


Example - printing a page from the Usenet Cookbook whose URL is:

http://info.cern.ch:8001/cmns-moon.think.com:210/WWP/TEXT/1706/2=cmns-moon.think.com;3=0000000223WWP%20;7=%00;

Any idea where what is wrong ? Viola has no difficulty displaying the page.

If any of you developers would like to cast a tolerant eye over
the new library, it is in

ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/dev/WWWLibrary_2.0-alpha.tar.Z

I am working om it all the time, but I thought that if you
want to fit in with the new architecure which is much
more flexible then you might want to see the interfaces and
try it out now.

The server and line mode browser both basically work using
the new library.
I haven't released them.

Hi,

1) In the wwwlib 1.0 there is a problem with the ftp protocol, It is unable to
establish connection with VMS and other systems.

Part of this problem is the way it define the RETR command (it does it in a
unix style and not in a VMS style)

I think that in gopher+ this problem of accessing different ftp servers
is fixed,

Is it also in the new wwwlib 2.0 ???

Subject: World-Wide Web documentation in paper form
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch



For all of you that want to take the information about the
web on the plane with you and don't have a modem for your airphone,
or for those who simply love the rustle of paper, here are some of
the key documents about the web and how it works in paper form.

Each document is in available postscript (.ps) and also in plain  
ASCII text (.txt) form, in the anonymous FTP archive site at  
info.cern.ch. (FTP to info.cern.ch, log in as "anonymous", give your  
user@host as password, then change directory to pub/www/doc )

line-mode-guide.ps	Instructions for running the line-mode
			client

www-server-guide.ps	Instructions for running a server

http-spec.ps		The HTTP protocol used by new W3 servers
			
html-spec.ps		The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
			

The last three have recently been revised.

If anyone has any comments on these, please send them to me or
to the www-talk@info.cern.ch discussion list if you are a member.
The HTML and later the HTTP specs are headed in the Internet
Draft - RFC direction so comment at this stage is appreciated.
The documents are all generated from the hypertext, and so
apart from the specs which are designed to be linear documents, they  
made read a little strangely. None of them is perfect, but the  
pressure has been so high for printed documentation that we  
distribute them as they are.

For developers:

I have put new 2.0-alpha compatible line mode browser and daemon  
sources into the same ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/dev directory as
the library so you can see how it works.  Yes, I know there
is lots of conceptal design which is not documented, but if you
have used the old library this should be much easier.  Documentation  
will come ...  I would like priority feedback on whether features
or documentation are preferred!

Some features of the new library are

- registration system for format-converting modules
- registration of external programs for
   presenting new types of object
- registration of protocol modules
- registration of filename suffix <-> content-type mapping

These registration routines exist, and a default initialisation files  
exists, initialisation will be done from config files, etc etc.
but you can add your own init module.

- HTML genereration as well as parsing
- Same module used by daemon and browser for looking at directories
- Ability to write files back in a protocol-independent manner

The www will for example (if DISPLAY is defined) run xv to view
jpeg and gif files, ghostview on postscript etc.  There is an  
embryonic test dataset in  
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Test/Overview.html
of things to test in the new protocol.

The current daemon will return a MIME format message if it gets a new
style request.  It will not (yet) be intelligent about which format  
to send back.  But the client provides all it needs to know.

That version of ViolaWWW forgets about the search result page after you
follow a link in it. A simple way to get around this, for now, is to 
simply clone that page first, then use it to navigate among the results.

Well, we are getting very near the point where we should do a Call for

that point).  Once we get our newsgroup, then we should consider something
like that.  Didn't someone out there mention that they would handle

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]

Lynx 2.0 (Alpha version) is now available.

Lynx was developed by the University of Kansas for use as a CWIS
interface.

With the help of the WWWLibrary Lynx is now a complete WWW client!

Lynx provides a simple, easy to use full screen curses interface 
for UNIX systems.  As well as some advanced features such as 
a configureable and editable home page for each user and cut
and paste functions for moving links to the home page.  

Lynx provides a simple yet powerful printing interface, providing
the functionality to mail files to yourself and any number of
system administrator configured printers.  Lynx also fills
in some of the missing Gopher interface. (CSO, file transfer, etc)

Assistance is needed for porting Lynx to all operating system, as
K.U. has a very limited number of operating systems in use.

For a limited time the alpha (and soon beta) version will be available
for anonymous ftp from 'acs220.cc.ukans.edu' in the /pub directory.

Any and all comments and suggestions are welcome and encouraged!

There seems to be a nasty li'l bug somewhere inside either Mosaic or
Motif that is causing an occasional coredump when closing a window,
but only on Ultrix boxes (and then only on some Ultrix boxes -- I
absolutely cannot reproduce it on our Ultrix box).  The traceback
looks like this:

If this happens to you, can you send me the values of count and

Subject: WWW processing of tar files
Date: Fri, 12 Mar 93 14:00:58 GMT
From: "Peter Lister, Cranfield Computer Centre" <ccprl@xdm001.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk>

Have WWW (or Gopher for that matter) developers considered processing
tar and tar.Z files as if they were directories? One could browse the
contents of a remote tar file, or treat it as a binary file to copy
back to the local host.

This has obvious application for shareware source at FTP archives, and
could save disk space and bandwidth: removing the need to copy an
entire tar file back when only a few are wanted; economising on server
disk space by not having to keep an unpacked directory tree as well as
a tar.Z; encouraging bulk transfers to be compressed, yet still
allowing the user to see "just files". Browsers would allow the user to
save the tar/tar.Z file, or just the list of contents, or transparently
unpack it. If added to libwww, it can be built easily into client and server ends.

Comments? Is this sensible?

Subject: Re:  WWW processing of tar files

This sounds fairly simple.  The question is, at which point should
the unpacking be done?  If the server simply presents the whole
file as a directory tree, then the client will never get the whole
tar file in one. But if the whole tar file is shipped over as a
lump, then looking at the first README is expensive.

How about both?  Suppose anz directorz which has an xxx.tar[.Z]
in it is visible as both xxx.tar.Z for capture and also as
a plain virtual directorz xxx for browsing?

The new librarz uses the same code for the server as for the client, so
having written one the other way will come free. I gets its just
a popen("zcat xxx.tar.Z | tar -tf -") ... can tar produce a
subdirectorz listing?  hmmm... shouldn't be a problem.

  
Sorry about the zy interchanges ... funnz kezboard lazout...

Exactly what I was trying to get at. Clients and servers would have
dynamic settings like "treat_tar_files_as_directories" true/false.
Servers could have a setting, on a per directory basis, depending on
the presence of .treat_tar_files_as_directories, like .www_browsable,
or command line switches, so that tar/tar.Z files can appear as files,
directories or both, and also as contents listings (from tar tv) so
that clients don't need to haul the whole archive over the net or
traverse the tree to see what's in it. Possibly also a line or  flag in
httpd.conf, rather like the map extensions? I would incline to giving
server admins several different wasy to go about setting this, for
bulk, per dir and individual files. I dunno, Tim, you're the boss.

In essence, tar files would be treated like directory now are, with the
exception that the binary contents of the tars are of interest, whereas
the binary contents of directories aren't.

A related request: with the Distribution of GNU software already
changed to gzip-ped '.z' files I would like to see gzip used in
www lest it does not entail any legalese problems. From my (shortsighted)
point of view this should be easy, as gzip "understands" (i.e.:uncompresses)
.Z files...

On a different note: has anyone done any work with the 'REL' and 'REV'
attributes, especially in combination with the 'Includes' relationship?
After LOONG hesitation, it looks like something might finally start
happening at our place, drawing on our experience with knowledge
representation schemas like the KL-ONE family (basically, using
REL and REV 'Includes' links as is-a and part-of specifications...).

Thank you!

pAolo

ps.: our COMPLIMENTS to all the www-related developers!

Back to the inlined image thread again -- I'm getting close to
releasing Mosaic v0.10, which will support inlined GIF and XBM
images/bitmaps, as mentioned previously.  So I just reread the
exchanges we had a while back, and have a few comments...

Tim Berners-Lee writes:

We're not prepared to support INCLUDE/EMBED at this point; it raises a
number of nasty issues that are quite separate from the idea of
inlined images.  For example, what happens if one EMBEDS a document
that in turn EMBEDS the first document?  Oops.  Aside from this, I'm
not sure I see the point in allowing arbitrary EMBED's for things like
chunks of texts: this is a hypertext system, after all, and it ought
to be possible to get the functional effect of an EMBED by using an
ordinary link.  Right?

So, we're probably going to go with <IMG SRC="url"> (not ICON, since
not all inlined images can be meaningfully called icons).  For the
time being, inlined images won't be explicitly content-type'd; down
the road, we plan to support that (along with the general adaptation
of MIME).  Actually, the image reading routines we're currently using
figure out the image format on the fly, so the filename extension
won't even be significant.

Cheers,
Marc

Subject: binary file access via Mosaic
X-Md4-Signature: 2c3a6314939fd5cff58d08974b594917

A frequent comment of Mosaic users is that binary files of a type that
Mosaic doesn't recognize (i.e., with a filename extension that Mosaic
doesn't recognize) aren't just saved to disk rather than uselessly
displayed as text.  The following document (online as
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/mosaic-docs/file-typing-issues.html)
details the issues involved and explains the solution developed for
the uncoming 0.10 release; I'd appreciate any comments or feedback.

NCSA Mosaic File Typing Issues
******************************

Motivation
==========

Quite independent from their sources, files have types. A given file can
be plaintext, HTML, GIF, JPEG, AIFF, MPEG, PostScript, you name it.
(MIME provides a way to type data elements within a file, but the file
itself still has a type: MIME.)

In an ideal world, the type of each file would be well-defined metadata
always accessible to an information browsing client prior to the act of
accessing the file. This is true on the Macintosh, but not on most other
systems, and certainly not on the Unix-dominated Internet. Bummer.

Therefore, in an imperfect world, Mosaic uses the common (but not
mandated and not standardized) convention of examining a file's
extension to attempt to determine its type. PostScript files are assumed
to be suffixed '.ps', GIF files '.gif', etc. In this way, Mosaic can
correctly determine file types for the majority of the data files available
on the Internet.

When a file type cannot be thus derived, Mosaic makes a guess. Files
coming over a HTTP server are assumed to be HTML; files coming
from any other source (except Gopher; see below) are assumed to be
plaintext.

This, of course, causes a problem. What happens when a file is assumed
to be viewable text, but it really isn't? Well, Mosaic attempts to display
it as text. Boom. Serious badness.

Solution
========

In Mosaic version 0.10 (and later), there is a solution. The user is
allowed to select, on the fly, whether untyped files (i.e., files with no
recognizable suffix) are to be assumed to be viewable (text) or not
viewable (data). If the former, such files will be displayed; if the latter,
such files will be dumped to a local disk and the user will be notified
appropriately.

When files of unrecognized types are automatically dumped to disk as
binary data in this manner, Mosaic is said to be in "binary transfer
mode".

A toggle button in the Options menu allows you to turn binary transfer
mode on and off, on the fly, at the per-window level. It is implicitly
assumed that binary transfer mode will generally be off, since many
common documents (for example, the results of a WAIS query, with a
URL something like '.../my-database?query') need to be assumed to be
text for the usual Mosaic interfaces to function. However, when you're
in a situation, e.g. while browsing an anonymous FTP site, where you
know you want to pull over 'file.xyz' and you know that file 'file.xyz' is
really binary data and shouldn't be displayed as text, then you turn on
binary transfer mode, access the file, grab the file from the local disk
(where it is dumped automatically by Mosaic), and switch back out of
binary transfer mode.

Note that binary transfer mode does not impact other Mosaic
functionality; notably:

 o Automatic and transparent uncompression of compressed (.Z)
   and gzip'd (.z) files still occurs with untyped files.
 o Binary (data) files with recognized extensions (e.g., '.gif' and
   '.jpeg') are still passed off to the appropriate external viewers.
   (Note that a new feature in 0.10 is that if the name of an data
   type's external viewer is defined via the X resource mechanism
   to be "dump", then data files in that format will be dumped to
   disk as if they were untyped files being retrieved in binary
   transfer mode.)

Notes
=====

Note that it is practically impossible to heuristically determine whether
an untyped file is viewable or not viewable as text for the simple reason
that 8-bit text is now commonplace.

Gopher has its own typing system (and not a very good one, at that). As
such, the rules don't apply. Mosaic tries to do the right thing with
various types of Gopher files, but using a different scheme, based on the
Gopher-defined file types.

I would consider this an error of the author that needs to be detected
to protect the browser.  It only requires maintaining a stack of
nested EMBEDS.

Some other hypertext systems do this, in a sense: in Guide there are,
apart from real GOTO stype hyperlinks, also "folds" (I think they are
called) which are sort of embedded documents that you can open and
close.  The advantage in certain situations is that opening a fold
retains more context than following a link.  It feels like using an
outline processor, which is rather pleasant (for certain kinds of
information).

form this should take?  (I remeber getting in an unpleasant fight with

Still, I'd argue the principle is still there.  If a document has to
be pieced together on the fly, it could get arbitrarily complex, and
even if that were limited, we'd certainly start experiencing major
hits on performance for documents structured in this way.  This
essentially throws the single-hop principle of WWW out the door (well,
IMG does that too, but for a very specific reason and in a very
limited sense) --- are we sure we want to do that?

Would be nice to be able to do this, but it would essentially be just
a fancy multi-windowed version of the current distributed hypertext
model, right?  Instead of jumping to whole new documents, the act of
triggering a link would open up more information in the current
context.  That doesn't require EMBED functionality...

Mosaic currently recognizes documents suffixed .mime and throws 'em
off to metamail.  Some support for MIME is in Tim's new WWW library
(although I haven't looked very closely at it).  Other than that, I'm
not sure what the consensus exactly is.  And Dano's history, I do
believe...

To: www-talk@nxoc01.cern.ch
Date: Sat, 13 Mar 93 15:18:26 CST
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL2]

As many of you may know, Gopher file type 2 is a CSO nameserver 
interface.  All of the WWW clients that I have seen do not support
this file type.  Why not?

A page similar to the Gopher index page could be displayed,
with some additional instructions on how to construct a query.

For instance:  To search on all fields simply say "query STRING"
	       To search on a particular field like a name field
	       say "query name=STRING"

The client simply has to send an extra "\nquit\n" to complete the
query, or cut off the connection when the string "200:Ok" or
"501:No matches to your query." is sent by the server. 

Considering the fact that there are over 100 CSO servers available
for these queries, doesn't it seem necessary to support them?

Maybe a new url type is in order:
	"cso://cso.univ.edu:105/"

Subject: NCSA Mosaic for X 0.10 released
X-Md4-Signature: 0db169a5824c601861f4fd1ef360d334

Beta version 0.10 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, is hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic/xmosaic-0.10.tar.Z
                         .../xmosaic/binaries-0.10/xmosaic-sun.Z

                         .../xmosaic/binaries-0.10/xmosaic-dec.Z

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DEC Ultrix.

More binaries will be supplied as I am able to find other
Motif-configured platforms to use.  (Contributions of working
binaries, or development systems, are welcome.)  Documentation is
available online.

Changes since 0.9 include:

 o Support for <IMG> tag: inlined images in HTML documents.
    o Handles X bitmap and GIF formats so far.
    o New resource, colorsPerInlinedImage, can be used to restrict
      color use of inlined images -- default is 50.
    o Image files can be located anywhere on the net (pointed to by
      URL); image data is cached in memory for fast display and
      reuse.
    o Example of inlined bitmap: 
      <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/foobar.xbm">
    o Example of inlined image serving as anchor: 
      <A HREF="http://foobar.com/ref.html"> 
      <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/blagh.gif"> </A>
 o Better support for acting as binary file retrieval client.
    o Each window can either be in binary transfer mode or not;
      resource binaryTransferMode controls startup value (default
      is 'False', and you probably don't want to change this). A
      toggle button in the Options menu allows changing on the fly.
    o If a window is not in binary trasfer mode, data files with
      unrecognized types will be displayed in the window as either
      plain text or HTML (depending on the server type), as before.
    o If a window is in binary transfer mode, data files with
      unrecognized types will be dumped to a local file after being
      transferred over as binary data.
    o Regardless of whether a window is in binary transfer mode or
      not, files with recognizes types (images, sound, etc.) will be
      handled as usual, and uncompression will be transparent as
      usual.
    o The whole point of all this is to allow the user to select on the
      fly how a given file of an unrecognized type is to be handled.
    o Because files are currently typed by filename extension,
      binary transfer mode should generally be kept off, otherwise
      it will screw up things like WAIS searches pretty badly. Also,
      since Gopher does things differently from everyone else,
      things are different there too.
    o Setting one of the multimedia resources to the text string
      "dump" will cause files of that type to be dumped to local
      disk as though in binary transfer mode.
    o See http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/mosaic-docs/file-typing-issues.html 
      for a more thorough discussion of these issues.
 o Audio annotations for Sun's with /usr/demo/SOUND/record (or
   something similar) are now enabled. Resources
   recordCommandLocation and recordCommand are used to specify the
   command used to record sound; theoretically, this approach can be
   used on any platform with appropriate hardware and software,
   although SGI Indigo & Sun Sparcstation are the only two that I know
   of.
 o Search capability within documents: enter search term, scrollbar
   jumps to match and match is highlighted; repeat as desired.
 o Enhanced support for various Gopher types, including binary files
   and CSO phonebooks (sorry, phonebooks aren't supported yet, but at
   least now an error message shows up).
 o Spaces converted to +'s in keyword queries now.
 o Scrollbar arrows now increment a reasonable amount when viewing
   large documents.
 o Anonymous FTP password is now always user@host.domain,
   enabling access to every strange FTP server out there that I know of.
 o Pattern-matching to determine file type based on file name now uses
   caseless string compare.
 o Better default visited anchor color for non-SGI color displays.
 o Messages from libwww now show up in pop-up dialogs like they
   should.
 o Telnet never gets asked to use unrecognized -l flag.
 o Tar files are now always retrieved to local disk (and not displayed).
 o Replacement (and better) Archie interface.
 o Mail Developers window is cleared on each use.
 o New resource trackVisitedAnchors; can be used to turn off tracking
   of visited anchors altogether.
 o Better transparent uncompression support:
    o Gzipped (.z) files are now recognized and uncompressed on
      the fly (as well as .Z files, as before).
    o New resources uncompressCommand (default 'uncompress')
      and gunzipCommand (default 'gunzip').
 o As usual, little bugfixes and cleanups.

We're targeting a 1.0 release for the beginning of April, so quick
feedback and bug reports will be GREATLY appreciated.

Finally, thanks *again* to everyone who's been contributing comments
and bug reports -- keep 'em coming!

Cheers,

Subject: Support for CSO and gopher type 2

Lou:

The as-yet-mysterious Cello MS-Windows client supports CSO queries
as a gopher://  subscheme.  At the moment, the functionality is
limited -- you can only do searches on the name.  I will eventually
build in a method of launching a 'fields' query and retrieving the
results to a form for the user to fill in, much as the character-based
DOS gopher client and TurboGopher clients do.  But at the moment 
I'm cobbling up a bunch of things for a demo at the end of the month, 
and want to leave this particular frill fairly simple for now.

Regards,
Tb.

There is a good chance that greed has killed gopher.  Certainly, IMHO,
this puts an end to gopher+.  Most likely there will be other servers
created which are public domain or with GNU-like licenses, but they
won't be gopher+ compatible.  If such a server were available now, I
guess I would switch to it.

Also Univ of Minn will cease (or maybe already has) to be the central
authority of gopherdom.  I'm afraid we will have incompatible versions
of servers.  It really is extremely important now to get an rfc, to
try to nail down the minimal protocol.

I really do have a great sense of sadness about this.  There are a number
of examples of extremely successful "pro bono publico" software.  One
thinks of perl, gcc, gnu emacs and the NCSA offerings.  I had hoped that
gopher would be another and it is disappointing to see greed wipe out
that hope.

I had hoped that gopher would become the main vehicle for electronic
scholarly journals.  It would be a great boon to academia if all
scholarly journals could be accessed with the same protocols so a
student or researcher would only need to learn to use one type of
client to access the "electronic library" of the future.  Today it
seems rather unlikely that this library will use a gopher protocol.
Scholarly journals certainly can't afford to pay 7.5% of their gross
receipts to the Minnesota gopher team, not to mention the $5K
annually.  Most likely we will end up with several incompatible
proprietary schemes for accessing electronic journals.  Or maybe WWW
will start to take off.  Electronic publishers are very interested in
SGML anyway.  This is a golden oportunity for the WWW people.

Subject: 2.0 alpha testers?
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch

I would like brave alpha testers of the 2.0 www code, in particular  
of the multimedia bits.

The 2.0 libwww, line mode client and the server are on
ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src now.   The library will handle  
multiple types of the same document when resolving links to
imaginary files called xxx.multi -- it will return xxx.ps or xxx.txt  
or xxx.gif depending on what the client can handle.

The bug in the server release that it didn't contain and code is  
fixed!

The tables of suffixes are in the c code (*Init.c) for now.
Note they can be quite different on client and server. See  
HTFormat.h, HTFile.h for routines to add configuation info
from your specific app code.

The current tables excpet ghostview and xv to be available
if DISPLAY is defined (for X) or the usual plethora of
image-handling apps on the NeXT [RIP].

Servers:  Note the rule file must now translate from a string
starting without protocol or nodename (as transferred in HTTP)
into a URI -- that is, you have to put file: onto the front
of all the filenames like:

#	HTTPD config file
#
map 	/	     /hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/cern.html
map 	/hypertext/* file://www3/Net/dxcern/userd/timbl/hypertext/*
pass	file://www3/Net/dxcern/userd/timbl/hypertext/*
fail 	*

You may see the implicatioon of this that you can map into
other spaces, and yes, that is right -- like you can map bits of
your http space into news of ftp or gopher or whatever. In other
words, the server works as a gateway to everything the client can
handle.  (Note gatewaying news: is not strictly legal I think)

This means you turn virtually anything into HTML.  But I haven't got
www command line options fixed up yet.

Directory listings are not sorted yet, but they do get README
put in (not for FTP directories, but for local ones).  As the
server and client code are the same, you can use a www client as
a directory browser.

Please let me know if you take this code and try it.  The important
thing is for client developers to check out the interfaces.

Subject: Upgraded  2.0 sources.  Please upgrade servers.
Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch


There is some new HTTP test data for 2.0 clients on
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Test/Overview.html

I have upgraded the sourecs on ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src
to fix a few bugs.  The daemon now can take a directory name to  
export on the command line to save having to write a rule file.

There is a back-compatibility problem with HTTP, in that some old  
servers are messed up by the new protocol.  I think this is pre 0.9a  
servers, which do not ignore the third word on the command line.
Servers based on csh etc should be OK, as is the 0.9b server.
This is unfortunate, and means we have to do round upgrading servers  
before upgrading clients.  I would recommend that servers be updated
as soon as possible.  The new httpd is running on info.cern.ch and
doesn't seem to have upset anyone yet after the first 40k  
transactions.  I would now class the 2.0 server code as beta.
The client I will keep as alpha (a) to prevent people picking it
up and getting snagged on old servers, and (b) because there is
more functionality to go in. (WAIS etc)  However, is seems to work  
well too, and so feel free to pick it up to test new servers.

I would like to keep a list of servers which have upgraded, so
please mail me if you do.

When you do upgtae, the new binary is quite compatible with the old  
binary except that the rule file must map requests onto sull URLs,  
including the file: prefix. The online doc has been modified.

Reply-To: timbl@nxoc01.cern.ch



The 2.02 version of the library is marked "beta" to indicate that it  
ought to work reliably and needs testing.   Compatible line-mode  
browser and daemon are available too as before. Sources are in
ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src as usual.

Changes are
-----------

- Fix so that the HTTP client will fall back to old HTTP with servers
 which don't like the HTTP extenstions.  The incompatibility problem
 of yeste
 

- A format called text/x-c which can be generated from hypertext.

	www -to text/x-c xxxx.html > xxxx.h
	
  will produce a formatted .h file with everything enclosed in
  comments except for preformtted sections, which are treated as
  code.  This allows files like
   
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Implementation/HTFormat.html 

  to be self-documenting source files.
  

  

 Internal documentation.
 ----------------------
 

I have made a token bit of documentation on the library to explian
a few features using the above technique. I used
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/HTMLGeneration/text2html.sed
to generate the html froim the .h files in the first place before  
marking it up. Feedback on forms and content (but not extent which I  
know is not much!) is welcome.

One of the more annoying aspects of being a member of the www
community is the flood of mail you get whenever you send something to
the list.  And I don't mean enthousiastic (or even less positive)
reactions: I'm referring to the messages from mailer daemons all over
the world that tell you a certain address is unreachable.  Hey, I
don't maintain the list, why should I be bothered with these errors!?

I am maintaining a mailing list myself and I know that it is possible
to set up things so this does not generally happen.  Just a few more
aliases and an extra header line added to each outgoing message should
do the trick.  (Giving detailed instructions makes no sense since
different distribution systems do it differently.)  Please, Tim, I
know you're very busy and your work is much appreciated, but would you
please try to (get somebody to?) fix the mailing list setup?

I repeat the earlier comment that the compatibilty problem has been  
fixed.

The sources have been improved (now 2.02), and the README.

The server is quite compaible wit the old server except the
rule file format which must map requests to a full URI.

Send me any bugs ASAP -- thanks for those who already have, they
should be taken care of in the above.

Which, translated, means:  "I'm sorry, the document as far as I can
tell is binary and I don't know how to present that to you as
you haven't told me you can handle binary."

That is because I haven't reagistered .sed as text.  I just might
make the default text rather than binary. Anyone got any smart
ideas about how to distinguish (fast?).  In the mean time
I'll register a new suffix.

This simple but sometimes confusing system is richer with 2.0.
The response can be of type OK, error, forward, etc.  The error

Subject: NCSA Mosaic for X 0.11 (maintenance release)
X-Md4-Signature: b63d3931cb5bafe0847addd0acbdf232

NCSA Mosaic for X 0.11, a maintenance release with two small but
crucial bugfixes, is now in the usual place...

        file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/xmosaic

Changes are:

 o Bug fix for non-SGI X servers: bitmaps now show up with
   correct (normal foreground and background) colors.
 o Bug fix for Ultrix: no more meaningless coredumps when
   closing windows.

0.12 will come in 2-3 weeks with another batch of miscellaneous
bugfixes, followed by 1.0 shortly thereafter.  As usual, thanks in
advance for feedback and comments!

Cheers,
Marc

Subject: Announcing tkWWW Version 0.6 alpha


tkWWW Version 0.6 alpha (joe@athena.mit.edu)
--------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?

-------------
World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext project which seeks to build a
world wide network of hypertext links.  There are several different
browsers for this system including a simple tty interface.  For a 
demo of the terminal browsers for WWW, telnet to the following sites:

 telnet info.cern.ch or telnet 128.141.201.74 (SWISS)
 telnet eies2.njit.edu or telnet 128.235.1.43 (USA [NJ])
 telnet vms.huji.ac.il or telnet 128.139.4.3  (ISRAEL)
 telnet info.funet.fi or telnet 128.214.6.100 (FINLAND)

 and login as "www"

Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily.

tkWWW is a Tk interface to (WWW).

Since the entire user interface is written in an interpreted language,
it is very easy to make modifications and extensions to the system.
Right now, work is under way to convert tkWWW to a full fledged HTML
editor.

What has changed since 0.5?
---------------------------
works with vanilla wish
User configurable menus
Help system (under construction)
Personal annotation with format compatible with xmosaic
Menu option to mail hypertext pages to other users
Menu option to print hypertext pages
Now recognizes the environment variable WWW_HOME
Goes to internal links
The beginnings of a HTML editor 
Ability to change fonts (under edit menu)

Where is this?
--------------
tkWWW 0.6 can be anon ftp'ed from
   export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/tkWWW-0.6.tar.Z
   harbor.ecn.purdue.edu:/tcl/extensions/tkWWW-0.6.tar.Z
   info.cern.ch:/pub/WWW/src/tkWWW-0.6.tar.Z

Mailing list
------------
There is a mailing list devoted to discussions about tkWWW at 
 
   tk-www@athena.mit.edu

To get on this list, send e-mail to

   tk-www-request@athena.mit.edu

To Install
----------

1. Edit the file "tkWWW.imake" to set system defaults
2. Type "make"
3. Type "make install"

Being delighted by xmosaic, I have been doing lots of demos.
Unfortunately, X servers are crashing.

Using the xmosaic-0.9 and -0.10 distribution binaries,
I have encountered crashes on a variety of servers:
   MIT X11r5 on DEC with DEC xmosaic
   MIT X11r4 on Vax with AIX xmosaic
   MacX      on Mac with Sun xmosaic

But, is beta code, right?
Well, apparently mine is the only bug report on this.
Thus the NCSA folk responded that it was the "fault" of the servers.

So, if you have a server crash, I suggest you email marca@ncsa.uiuc.edu,
so the problem's magnitude can be guaged.

I got the following files from the info.cern.ch archive:
WWWDaemon_0.9b.tar.Z and WWWLibrary_1.1a.tar.Z

After unpacking them, I looked for the BUILD script that was with the more
recently released beta versions (which I started with but scrapped after
encountering numerous errors and problems.)

So I made the library OK, although I gather that you shouldn't have to do
that -- isn't it the case that building the Daemon builds the library in
temporary space?  Anyway, I then proceeded to try make for the Daemon, and
get hung up in several places; some I could fix -- like it looks for
Makefile.include in the sun4 directory, where there is no such file...

Anyway, in going through these parts, I get the feeling that the rush to
provide lots of services to lots of people has left some things only half
done!  Has anyone else figured out all the things one has to change to
build the httpd daemon for a sun4?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

Let me address this is painfully honestly as I can.  As I explained to
Mr. Charity in private email, it is literally impossible for an X
client to *cause* an X server crash.  It is literally not possible.

What is happening to Mr. Charity, of course, is that the X client is
issuing some sequence of requests (Lord knows what sequence, since
he's sent me no information from which I can attempt to guess) that is
exposing bugs in the X servers he's using.

Let me repeat again: X clients cannot *cause* X server crashes, and
there is no way for an X client to know what particular sequence of
requests will expose a particular server bug, so it's not even
possible to prevent those bugs from being exposed in a particular
server by a particular client.  There is nothing the client can do to
prevent server crashes caused by server bugs -- nothing.

Thus, yes, indeed, Mr.  Charity's crashes are the "fault" of the
servers.  When I worked at a certain Large Workstation Maker with a
Three Word Name that shall remain unidentified, incoming bug reports
of the nature "client XYZ crashes the server" were routinely
classified AND FIXED as server bugs.  It is simply the way things are.
It is simply how X is designed, and implemented.

So no, don't send mail to me because your X server is crashing.  If
your email domain is 'lcs.mit.edu', as Mr. Charity's happens to be,
and you're using a stock MIT server, I suggest you walk down the hall
or across the quad and talk to the X server experts.  If your server
was supplied by your vendor, complain to your vendor.

1. I just got a problem with your new httpd on info.cern.ch.

   When I tried to access the file: 

   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl

   with xmosaic 0.10, I got the following error message:

   HTFormat: Sorry, can't convert from application/binary to www/present.

   The line-mode browser www 1.3a produced the same error message.

   With www 2.0 an empty page were produced.

  After that I tried to use the new binary transfer mode feature of mosaic. 
  The result was a file with the above error message.

  The same problem occured with other files referenced from: 
  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/HTMLGeneration/Overview.html
  for example: text2html.sed

2. Is it possible to get the files referenced from:
   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/HTMLGeneration/Overview.html
   via ftp ? 

   Or can someone put the files on info.cern.ch under /WWW/dev ?

I have a couple of HTML servers written in perl, running

Is there a way in perl to find out the internet address of the client?
Or do I have to give up the convenience of inetd to do that?

I have an HTTP server written in perl, under SunOS Unix, as a
standalone daemon without inetd.  I considered inetd but am of the
opinion that the performance would be unacceptable if perl had to
parse the whole thing for every request.  Forks are not that expensive
in perl, and probably will be faster once we convert to a OpSys with
copy-on-write.  Thus, the code from mine looks more or less like the
code on page 345 of the Camel book.  It's running; URL
http://cs.indiana.edu/ if you want to peek.  I plan to release the
code once it's stable, though people can have unstable copies if they
really want.

The following code is taken from page 153 of the Camel book, and
probably does what you want:

  $sockaddr = 'S n a4 x8';
  $mysockaddr = getsockname(S);
  ($family, $port, $myaddr) = unpack($sockaddr, $mysockaddr);

(BTW, for the people who've been asking about it, full support for the

I just sent out the call for votes to news.announce.newgroups, and
comp.infosystems.  The voting begins as soon as the articles appear
(which depends on how soon the moderator posts them).  Please DO NOT
vote until you see the actual call for votes, and please do NOT send
me votes.

Tim, I've been going over the HTTP spec
(ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc/http-spec.txt), and have some questions.

What (if any) "Authorization" and "ChargeTo" schemes have been
registered?  Is anyone using these, to your knowledge?

The format of a response is not really clear, from the spec.  What is
"the format of a MIME message"?  Does this mean, "the format of an
RFC-822 message, as amended by RFC 1341"?  Or does this mean, "the MIME
headers `Content-Type' and `Content-Encoding' should appear first,
followed by a blank line, followed by the body of the response"?  Do
binary responses (gif, etc.) need to be BASE64'ed?  (Presumably not.)

Presumably the document ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc/http.txt is now
obsolete?

Is anyone working on an NFS server for HTTP?  That is, a server where
files on the file system would actually be references to HTTP-accessible
objects?

Thanks.

Is it legal HTML to start an internal anchor without a closing </A>?
For example, <A NAME="foo"> without a </A>

The trouble with doing this is that the hypertext browser has no way of
knowing whether to highlight the text behind the starting anchor or not.

O.K. unterminated anchors are illegal.

Are nested anchors?  It seems that the line mode browser doesn't support it
if it is legal.

Thanks for your comments.  By "MIME message" it means an RCC-822
message as enhanced by RFC1341, but with of ocurse the possibility of 8 bit
transmission. Something which we may want to add for this is a length
header field which MIME only allows on external, not internal, body parts.
We should sheck out the STMP 8 bit extensions which I am not sufficiently
knowledgable about.

No, base64 encodeing will not be necessary.  We have to decide
which MIME features may be sent without any permission from the client
but I imagine that all MIME encodings should be understood, but
only text/plain and text/html are required to be understood a priori.

No, I don't know of any Alex-style NFS server for http: space.

Tabular work is, accordingto the experts, a can of worms.
However, it is important.  It is definitely not in HTML,
but a good discussion is definitively in order.
Tables in practice need all kinds of things
(joined cells, break lines, etc)  A lot of work has been done,
it needs to be brought together and written up.

Pointers, anyone?

The rules of newsgroup creation demand equal time.  To vote against
the creation of the newsgroup, send a message to www-no@msen.com.

Please don't "reply all" to Tim's message, either, as this would make
it harder to sort out what things are votes, and what are replies to
his message.

For your convenience, here is a copy of the call for votes:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CFV: comp.infosystems.www

This is a formal Call for Votes on the creation of a new unmoderated
newsgroup called comp.infosystems.www, following a favorable discussion
of this newsgroup.

GROUP DETAILS
Name: comp.infosystems.www
Not moderated
Charter: In general, the discussion of all things related to the world
wide web, including design of software, development of new software,
and development of documentation within the Web.

VOTING

Do NOT send votes to me!!!
Do NOT post your vote!!!

To vote Yes: send mail to "www-yes@msen.com"
To vote No:  send mail to "www-no@msen.com"

In addition, the wording of the message must be in agreement with
the address, and should not include anything the least bit ambiguous.

Voting will end on April 20, 1993.  Any votes received after this
date will be ignored.

In order for the newsgroup to be created, the yes votes must account for
2/3 of the total number of votes, and must outnumber the no votes by
a margin of at least 100 votes.

As I mentioned to Nathan in private email, maybe just doing a
reasonable clone of the LaTeX table functionality would be a good way
to go.

Subject: Announcing A World Wide Web Browser For Emacs
Nntp-Posting-Host: avocado.ucs.indiana.edu
Organization: Computer Science Student, Indiana University
Date: Tue, 30 Mar 1993 03:34:25 GMT

This is to announce a World Wide Web browser for emacs (.004beta) that I've
written over the last week.  It's not extremely pretty code, but it works
(95% or so).

Right now the only links this doesn't support are news links (which
shouldn't be all that hard to work in, just haven't had the time just yet).
Telnet, Gopher, Ftp, HTTP, and local file access are all supported.  If you
are using Lucid Emacs or Epoch, the headers, titles, and nodes are
highlighted/in a different font, and menus are used.

Main Points:
 1. Supports relative file access (ie: links to foo.html instead of
    http://xxx.com:80/bar/foo.html)
 2. Gopher support via the gopher.el package written by Scott Snyder
    (snyder@d0gsc.fnal.gov)
 3. Telnet support via the transparent.el package written by Brian Tompsett
    (briant@spider.co.uk)
 4. Remote file access via ange-ftp.el, written by Andy Norman
    (ange@hplb.hpl.hp.com)
 5. Http and local file support by me
 6. Support for all HTML formatting commands (that I could find anyway)
 7. Automatic uncompression of files (gunzip or uncompress based on the
    file extension)
 8. If in X, automatic recognition of sound/postscript/dvi/gif/jpg/etc
    files, and piping to external commands (user-specifiable)
 9. Understands XMosaic hotlist files (and can modify them)
10. Searching (server-based, but prompts for keywords, etc)
11. Previewing of html buffers (w3-preview-this-buffer).  Mainly used by me
    to write urls to try and break the parser, but also good for checking
    normal html docs while writing.

I've only found a few html documents that could break this (and even then
not _completely_), so I figured I would release it and see if anyone out
there would like to use it/become a beta-tester.  If you decide to grab
this, please send me a mail message, so I can know if anyone out there is
actually using this stuff I write. :)

The file(s) can be ftp'd from moose.cs.indiana.edu in /pub/elisp/w3/*
The tar file contains ange-ftp, gopher, transparent, and w3.  If you've
already got these installed on your system, just grab the w3.el file that
is also in that directory.  

The default home page for the viewer is a documentation tree I am putting
together here on our http server.
(http://moose.cs.indiana.edu:80/elisp/w3/docs.html)

The tar file includes a makefile.  You can use this to automatically update
your .emacs (make emacs), as well as byte-compile the files (make all).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is one major problem. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't have emacs linked with the hostname resolultion library
(-lresolve), this won't work right now.  I've tried to work around this by
having a function called w3-open-stream.  If you have hostname resolution
linked in, no problem.  Just alias w3-open-stream to be
open-network-stream.  Works fine.  Problem comes when I want to define
w3-open-stream to be (start-process ... "/usr/ucb/telnet " host port etc).
Doesn't work at all.  The string never gets sent to the subprocess, and the
connection is eventually timed out.  Weird part is that if I use edebug to
step through the function, it works perfectly - sends the string to the
subprocess, and the file is retrieved.  Same thing happens if I type the
commands in lisp-interaction-mode.  But calling it from within a function
causes it to choke.

Any help on that problem would be greatly appreciated, since a lot of
people don't link with -lresolve, and don't have sysadmins as nice as mine
that will redo it on a whim. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any help/feedback would be appreciated.  Especially http addresses of files
that cause this to choke.

The source code by itself is also available via http (of course):
http://moose.cs.indiana.edu:80/elisp/w3/w3.el

    Is the "Home Page", i.e. mosaic-home.html in hoohoo.ncsa.uicu.edu, for
    xmosaic available via ftp or such? I have currently www, viola, and
    xmosaic available on our SUN's and in the case of viola/www I have
    edited the WWW_HOME page. Since I have the environment variable
    WWW_HOME set when I run xmosaic the *.html file for WWW gets picked up.
    To get mosaic-home.html displayed I need to unsetenv WWW_HOME first.
    Although that's no big deal, I would rather add an anchor to the
    xmosaic home page in my www.html file (or have the mosaic-home.html
    here).

    If I put an anchor to mosaic-home.html in my *.html the server refuses
    to hand it to me. I look forward to any suggestions or comments.

Werner, you say that you can pick up the XMosaic default home
page directly but not via a link from your own home page.
I suspect that this is a bug in the link.  Try picking it
up with

www -v

to see what it is trying to pick up, and if that doesn't show
you what is going wrong, mail the trace to me.

Lou,

Looks great!   There was just today a discussion at the IETF of how
a good screen mode www is needed!   I will move the tar files and
put in pointers when I get home next week, and announce it as beta.
I just played with it a little, I will mention it to a few people here
and forward you rmessage to www-talk.  If your code is not on
the server in a week, mail me again in case I dropped all my mail in a hole.
or the plane crshed or something.  I think this will be really
useful because of the large number of _real_ (ie vt100) users
out there.... and your message is very timely!

	Tim,
	    As you may know, Lynx 2.0 will have full WWW capabilities (or at least 
	those of the line mode browser).  Lynx 2.0 is currently in Beta test but I
	think it is about time for it to be added to the WWW software list that
	you maintain.  As a curses client I believe that Lynx has a lot to
	offer to the WWW comunity.  

	There is a demo account set up for anonymous login if you would 
	like to try it out.  Telnet to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu and login as "www".

	Anonymous FTP access to the source and binaries is at acs220.cc.ukans.edu.

	Let me know what you want me to do to help get this set up.

I have looked at Latex, tbl and Microsoft Word, and come up with a
rich yet easy scheme for augmenting HTML. Please look through
and voice your comments!

tbl is simple except when you want multi-line text which gets tedious
as you are forced to specify the line breaks explicitly. This can be
circumvented with a simple extension. The style of tbl leads to lots of
tabs for padding over empty cells. This comes from not being able to
say that a given cell should be further subdivided. It has a nice
feature for aligning numeric values, missing from Latex.

Latex's tablular environments are ok, but get messy for fields extending
across multiple columns.

Microsoft Word allows you to first specify the number of rows and columns
and then alter them, e.g. merging or splitting adjacent cells.


Here is my suggestion for a general scheme for specifying tables
which uses just three tags and IMHO is simpler than the above:

The following example from Lamport's Latex manual should make all this clear:

    -------------------------------------------------
    |    CG&A Hoofed Stock                          |
    |===============================================|
    |      ||    Price    |                         |
    |      ||-------------|                         |
    | Year ||  low | high |     Comments            |
    |-----------------------------------------------|
    | 1971 ||    97-245   | Bad year for farmers    |
    |      ||             | in the west.            |
    |-----------------------------------------------|
    |   72 ||   245-245   | Light trading due to a  |
    |      ||             | bad winter.             |
    |-----------------------------------------------|
    |   73 ||   245-2001  | No gnus was very good   |
    |      ||             | gnus this year.         |
    -------------------------------------------------

    <table>
        <line>
        <row cols="c">
        CG&A Hoofed Stock
        <line>
        <line>
        <row cols="|cb||c|cb|">
        Year <t>
        <table>
            <row cols="c">
            Price
            <line>
            <row cols="r|l">
            low <t> high
        </table>
        Comments
        <row cols="nnl20">
        1971 <t> 97-245 <t> Bad year for farmers in the west. <t>
        72 <t> 245-245 <t> Light trading due to a heavy winter.
        73 <t> 245-2001 <t> No gnus was very good gnus this year.
    </table>

Tables are specified by the <table> ... </table> tag.

You specify a format for the current row. This continues until a new
specification is given:

    <row cols=FORMAT> where the FORMAT is a string formed from:

    l       left aligned column
    r       right aligned column
    c       centered column
    n       numeric aligned column (on units or decimal point)

    t       align this cells contents at the top of the row
    b       align this cells contents at the bottom of the row

    |       a vertical line extending the height of this row only
            this is repeated for mutiple lines

The vertical alignment is an optional suffix following l,r,c,n.
An optional width can be given as an integer following l, r, c
(after t or b if present) to indicate the desired width of the column
in characters (av.char width), e.g. "lt40"

Numerically aligned fields will be nominally centered, but adjusted so
that the units digits line up (or the decimal point). You can also
specify more that one number, e.g. nnn-nnn, in which case the browser
may be able to line up the "-" chars, or failing that to simply centering
the text. (Should we make "-" an optional format character, e.g. "n-n" ?)

The text for each cell is separated by a tag e.g. <t> rather than the
tab character as used by tbl.

The <line> tag ends the current row and draws a line extending across the full
extent of this table. Any missing cell values are padded with blanks.

You can nest <table> tags to split a given cell into smaller ones. The width
and height of the nested table then effects the size of the row and column
of the parent table, into which it is inserted.

All rows in a given table have the same width. The width of each cell is
determined by the cell containing the largest value for the corresponding
row and column.

It may be advisable to require all <row> tags in a table to specify the
same number of columns. In this case you then need an "s" format character
to indicate a spanned column, i.e. merged with the preceding one.
