I agree!  I have also been frustrated with not having the option of a hard
return without the blank line that the <p> flag adds.  Any solution for
that that I have missed?

Ok, you tell me, URN's will be persistant and will re-direct me
around this temporary outages. But until that happens, could
we not come up with mechanism for reporting:

"We are experiencing momentary technical difficultes, please stand by..."
with a brief message about what the nature of the problem is and
who can be contacted. 

Perhaps there could be a high-availability site(s) with replicated
data where HTTP server maintainers could deposit information about
server difficulites. This could even be automated to an extent,
with the site "ping'ing" registered http servers, reporting
their availability. Also the Clients could search there whenever
a connection times out.

Until we have URN's this would be a big advantage in making WWW
more accessable to the general public, who expects some sort
of "We are experiencing momentary technical difficultes, please stand by..."
message when things are not working.

I sometimes use the <PRE> ... </PRE> tag manually for
sections in my documents to preserve hard returns and
not bother with <p>'s.  I don't know if it is a good
solution, but hey, it's a solution.

I may be missing something in this discussion, but if I want the return
without the blank line I just use the <br>, which results in a
linefeed-only on all of the clients that I have used. However, I have only
used the NCSA family of clients--XMosaic, MacMosaic and Mosaic for Windows.

Yes there is a solution that you have missed.  The <br> tag.  It stands
for line BReak.  But you shouldn't feel bad about not knowing about it,
the documentation and specifications about the web has been 
VERY SLOW in getting updated!!!!!

wasn't the original message not about removing <p> alltogether and simply
define an empty line to be a paragraph break.
I would be in favour of such a change.

Subject: site-index.pl, Perl Script to index WWW sites, version 0.2...
content-length: 3089

I have a new version of site-index.pl, a Perl script which largely
automates the job of building local indexes for Martijn Koster's ALIWeb
(and, perhaps, other future services), at sites running NCSA httpd.
Documentation, and pointers to code, are available at:

  http://www.ai.mit.edu/tools/site-index.html

The script works by looking for HTML documents keyed with metainformation,
using the <META ...> tag which has been proposed on this list as a possible
feature for HTML+.  It's also, as of this version, capable of building
multiple indexes (e.g., one for information of local interest only, and one
for export).  For instance, site-index.html itself has the <META>info:

  <meta name="keywords" value="resource discovery, site management, tools">
  <meta name="description"
  value="This is the documentation for site-index.pl, a tool which allows
  administrators of sites running NCSA httpd to largely automate the
  construction of local indexes for services such as Martijn Koster's ALIWEB">

There are configuration flags which determine whether the script follows
symlinks, where it puts its output, etc.  (There's also an undocumented
flag which will cause the script to build an index including every HTML
file you have with so much as a title, <meta>information or no.  I put it
in for debugging only, and I can't imagine that it's the right thing for
very many people, but if you really think you want it, it's in there...).

A note of possible wider interest --- I've changed the NAMEs of the
<META>information to which the script responds.  The current lot are:

  description --- used to fill in the Description field of the IAFA
     templates (i.e., index entries) which the script builds.

  keywords --- used to fill in the Keywords field of the index entries

  resource-type --- what sort of thing this HTML file is.  The default
     (if none specified) is 'document', which is almost always appropriate;
     however, cover pages for search engines, input forms, and the like
     may be more appropriately indexed as being a 'service' (which is the
     other recognized value

  distribution --- if the script is configured to build multiple indexes,
     this meta-datum is used to determine which index is appropriate for
     a particular file.  The mapping between distributions and the names
     of the index files is configurable, as is the distribution used for
     documents which don't specify any.

(These are case-insensitive; also, the 0.1 meta-names, 'iafa-description',
'iafa-keywords', and 'iafa-type', are deprecated but still work).

A few final notes:

The script should be getting the description for the index entries out of
an HTML+ <ABSTRACT>, if one is present, but it doesn't do that yet.  (I
haven't yet figured out what to do with formatting tags in the abstract.
That problem also arises with <TITLE>s, BTW, but there I'm just stripping
them out).

Also, it should be fairly easy to adapt the script to servers other than
NCSA --- the NCSA dependencies are entirely confined to one function which
reads the config files.

    The IETF URI group has been working for decades on defining such a

    the year 2009.

It's real nice when you can ``just do it!''

We did it for our own use and it looks like this:

pdi://authority-name//4-digit-year/2-digit-month/2-digit-day/document-of-the-day-number.format.version

authority-name is a hierarchical name reflecting organizational subsumption,
country => organization and office

version is a number

format is an extension which is ignored for the purposes of document
identification but useful for return documents in a particular format

Of course, we didn't do document fragments in arbitrary formats.

Most everything else should be an assertion about the object.

Dear wwwers,
     I hope it is alright to pose this question on this list.  I have an 
account on a university main frame computer which has a lynx browser 
installed, so by logging onto my account and typing lynx I can access 
different resources using www.  However, it seems I am unable to use 
bookmark and several other commands, because I am not using a lynx 
browser that is on my own computer (supposing that my computer is on the 
internet).  I wonder if it is true that it is in fact because I don't 
have my own browser that I can not use those several commands.  Your help 
would be much appreciated!  Thanks in advance...
Tim

Subject: freeWAIS Multiformat type and WWW front end
content-length: 3040

We are experimenting with providing a WWW front end to a WAIS index of our
holdings of spatial datasets.

I have a number of varied queries and so have posted this message to both
the 'www-talk' and 'wais-talk' lists.

freeWAIS-0.202 provides a multiformat type which allows us to prepare a
WAIS index of text files which document the metadata about each dataset.
If the WAIS query results in a hit on a metadata file then all associated
files with the same root filename are presented by XMosaic.

For example a hit on 'state_boundaries.TEXT' will return:
   TEXT ..... the metadata text file
   GIF ...... an image of the spatial dataset
   PS ....... some documentation as a postscript file
   TAR ...... the actual spatial information as a UNIX tar file
   HTML ..... a pointer to an HTML document on the WWW server

However I have a few queries about all this...

-------------------------------
We do not store our metadata in text files but in an RDBMS.  So we do not
have any text files to index.  As far as I can see the only solution is to 
run a cron job every few days to generate metadata text files from the 
RDBMS for each dataset and index these.

Another solution may be to create a text file for each dataset of likely 
keywords, index these and then somehow intercept the query with either a
WAIS server script or a WWW server script.  Does anyone know if this would
be possible?

-------------------------------
I know that Mosaic for X-windows version 2.x clients support this 
multiformat type.  Do any other clients?

-------------------------------
Do any WAIS clients support this multiformat type so that non-WWW access
can be provided?

-------------------------------
Enventually we will have to look at some user authentication aspects 
because some of these datasets will be restricted.  Can someone please 
suggest some starting points to investigate this?

-------------------------------
Is anyone else doing work in this area and are they willing to share 
their discoveries?

-------------------------------
This obviously has amazing potential.  Anyone interested in this would 
do well to look at Marc Andreesen's 'Mosaic And WAIS Tutorial' at
http://wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/wais-tutorial/wais.html
Thanks for the tips Marc.

We hope to have a test server up and running in a couple of weeks at 
http://kaos.erin.gov.au/erin.html when this WWW server wil be revitalised.

I will monitor www-talk and wais-talk and fold any email directly to me 
plus my own ongoing research into a summary to both lists if there is any
interest.

The latter should be possible if you're going through a sufficiently
smart and customized WAIS/WWW gateway.  In other words, the gateway
has to be smart enough to map WAIS search hits to some representation
of files in the RDBMS; a parallel WWW script would then need to be
able to reach inside the database upon receiving a query for such a
representation.  I think that's how it would work...

I know xwais does.  I don't believe any other WWW clients do, but I
could easily be wrong.  (Any WWW client that has direct WAIS support
and uses Mosaic's libwww2 should be able to handle it.)

WWW currently provides "iffy" user authentication (passwords are sent
over the network uuencoded but not encrypted).  See:

    http://wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/auth-tutorial/tutorial.html

You can use this if you're always going through a WAIS/WWW gateway.

I'm not sure what the various versions of WAIS support along these
lines.

I've just uploaded tkWWW 0.11 prerelease 3 to info.cern.ch, and it
should be migrating over to /pub/www/dev in a few days.  The BIG
improvement of this prerelease is that it allows you to generate an
tkWWW executable.  I have uploaded an executable for the decstation up
to info.cern.ch, which means that if you have a decstation, you can
just download the executable and not have to do any compilations.

Hi All!

I just wanted to thank everyone who has responded so far.
I originally broadcast my request to www-talk, www-announce,
comp.infosystems.www, webmaster@host (for all hosts in Matthew 
Gray's most recent list), and the email addresses listed on 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/\
Geographical_generation/new-servers.html.
 
I've received about 190 email messages (from all over
the Web) and I think I'll probably have dates for more than 300
servers.   Not really close to the number of servers that are 
really out there but still (probably 1800 or so by now I'd guess).

I will be announcing a new WWW server real soon with
   (1) a fill-out form version of the survey
   and
   (2) the results to date
and I'll probably continue to post this message once a week or so
to try and keep up with new servers.

If this message is entirely cryptic to you, please see the text after
my signature below.

Thanks Everyone,

Hi Webmaster,

In the name of documenting the expansion of the WorldWideWeb, I'm trying to
collect the on-line dates of all WWW (http) servers.  Please help if you can!

If you know the date that your (or any) WWW server came on line
could you please send me the date.  I'm particularly interested in the dates
of servers that have been around for a long time.

If the server is no longer available, I would like to get the date it ceased
operation, too.

Please help me!  Information on as many servers as you know about would
be great!  A reply with the following would be great:

Server Home Page URL:
On-line Date: (Year, Month, and Day if known)

Subject:      Does HTML today comply with SGML?
To: www-talk@www0.cern.ch
content-length: 1013

Our best Web-weaver, Chuck Henrich, and I are trying to resolve a simple
question:  Does HTML comply with SGML?  All along it's been my
interpretation that it does.  By that I assume that it is possible
to take the Document Type Definition for HTML and feed that to
an SGML tool, and use that tool to validate HTML documents.  Chuck
is under the impression that at least some aspects of HTML are not
compliant; ie one could not use a commercial SGML tool to validate
documents as used on the Web today.

If HTML doesn't comply, is it because of elements in the spec, or
because of commonly-used extensions?

If HTML does comply, is there anyone out there who actually uses
an SGML tool to verify their HTML documents?  Or is this just
talked about?  (There was a great deal of discussion a few months
ago as to the badness of using Mosaic or another browser as a
validation tool.)

How about the proposed HTML+ spec?  Is it any more or less compliant
with SGML?

Rob McCool

I also need more Nominees for the following Categories:
Best Page Design:
	A html-ized document (not a custom WWW page) that makes good use of
	HTML, especially fonts, graphics, and hypertext, to communicate
	effectively in an electronic medium.
Best Educational Site:
	A service that uses the Web to teach common users about a specific

Best Use of Interaction
	a service that uses forms or image maps to allow the user to truly
	interact with the system.
Best Use of Multiple Media
	a document that uses graphics, video, or sound to accomplish something
	that could not be done as well with text only. (gratuitous icons don't

Yes. For example, if your doc is called 'foo.html' and you have
some version of "the HTML DTD" (e.g. the text from the appendix
of draft-iiir-html-01.txt, currently availale as
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.dtd.html)
and you have the sgmls exectuable in your path, you
can issue:

	sgmls -s html.dtd foo.html

and sgmls will validate foo.html.

Sad but true. Few authors take the time to validate their documents.
Few tool developers have ensured that their tools generate
valid HTML. Idioms like nested lists and such are not valid according
to the DTD, but they are supported and used widely.

The DTD has not been maintained over the last year or so.

>If HTML does comply, is there anyone out there who actually uses
>an SGML tool to verify their HTML documents?

I do. And I'm trying to develop a new DTD that captures more of
the current idioms. I'm currently collecting the issues and
developing a test suite.


>  Or is this just

Yes. It has deteriorated from the point of using something like
sgmls to validate a document and being pretty sure it would give
good data to the situation we have today where the only way to
be reasonably confident that the document is useful is to try
it on all the different browsers.

>How about the proposed HTML+ spec?  Is it any more or less compliant
>with SGML?

There's a DTD, but I'm not sure how the various features are being
used and/or supported.

   I would like some clarification of the relationship between SGML, HTML,

   me where necessary.

As I wrote the original draft of the HTML spec with the SGML standard
in my lap, I'll be glad to comment.

   - SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is an ISO standard 
   (ISO 8879:1986).  It is a system for defining documents and the 
   markup languages that represent those document types.

You got it. The official way to Cite SGML is:

ISO 8879:1986, Information ProcessingText and Office Systems --
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)

   - A DTD (Document Type Definition??) is a specific set of SGML semantics
   used to specify a document type and the markup language for representing
   that document.

   - HTML is an example of a SGML DTD.  Other examples are??

Here's the way I phrased it when I wrote the spec:

>From http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Intro.html
(which is part of:
 ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt):

The HyperText Markup Language is defined in terms of the ISO Standard
Generalized Markup Language [SGML]. SGML is a system for defining
structured document types and markup languages to represent instances
of those document types.

Every SGML document has three parts:

 o An SGML declaration, which binds SGML processing quantities and
syntax token names to specific values. For example, the SGML
declaration in the HTML DTD specifies that the string that opens a tag
is </ and the maximum length of a name is 40 characters.

 o A prologue including one or more document type declarations, which
specifiy the element types, element relationships and attributes, and
references that can be represented by markup. The HTML DTD specifies,
for example, that the HEAD element contains at most one TITLE element.

 o An instance, which contains the data and markup of the document. 

We use the term HTML to mean both the document type and the markup
language for representing instances of that document type.

All HTML documents share the same SGML declaration an prologue. Hence
implementations of the WorldWide Web generally only transmit and store
the instance part of an HTML document. To construct an SGML document
entity for processing by an SGML parser, it is necessary to prefix the
text from ``HTML DTD'' on page 10 to the HTML instance.

Conversely, to implement an HTML parser, one need only implement those
parts of an SGML parser that are needed to parse an instance after
parsing the HTML DTD.


   I have some other questions:

   - Can I effectively say that HTML is ISO-compliant or ISO-compatible?

I'm not sure how those terms are defined. These terms _are_ defined by
the SGML standard:

Conforming SGML Document: An HTML document (that is, when you take an
html file and prepend the HTML.DTD text, and change all the unix
newlines to SGML RE's) is a Conforming SGML Document (as per section
15.1 of the SGML standard). (Well... they're supposed to be anyway...
there are a lot of html files out there that wouldn't parse correctly
relative to any published DTD).

Minimal SGML Document: An HTML document (as above) is also a Minimal
SGML document (meaning it doesn't take a very powerful SGML parser to
parse it.) [There may be a few corners of the HTML declaration that
aren't quite minimal -- I'm not 100% sure at the moment, since we
tweaked LITLEN and NAMELEN a little]

Conforming SGML Application: WWW is _not_ a conforming SGML
application. For one, you have to document the fact that you are one
in order to be one, and nobody's done that. For two, most WWW
implementations allow all kinds of crap in HTML documents, and section
15.2.2 says "A conforming SGML application shall require its documents
to be conforming SGML documents... ."

Conforming SGML System: WWW is _not_ a conforming SGML system -- you
have to support arbitrary DTD's for this part.

   - When creating an SGML document, is the DTD the filter or translator
   that defines the resulting output?

Nope. The only output specified by the SGML standard is "Yes. It is a
valid document instance" or "No. It is not a valid document instance."
There's also this sort-of-formal ESIS (Entity Structure Information
Set or some such) that an SGML parser magically exposes to an
application. The question of how to translate the ESIS to postscript,
for example, is not specified by the DTD or any other SGML entity
(you'd have to look into DSSSSSSSSL or FOSI or something).

There are some tools for converting HTML to LaTeX for printing I
believe... though I am not familiar with their completeness/quality.

   - What commercial programs exist to create SGML documents?

Try the comp.text.sgml FAQ or some such... this isn't my area of
expertise.

   - What is the status/relationship of HTML+ to this?

   - What documentation exists about HTML other than what is on info.cern.ch?

Try this: http://www-external.hal.com/~connolly/html-design.html
It's my notebook on the design of a successor for HTML. It's got
pointers to all sorts of tutorials, discussion, and related specs.

Just as a test I had tried an SGML product from a company called
SoftQuad Inc. I had successfully parsed the HTML+ DTD (the one 
available at http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUP/htmlplus.txt)
using their SGML parser to build an HTML+ Tag File, everything worked
without any major problems.

One thing I forgot.  One of the categories is "Best WWW Browser."  Since
not everyone has access to every browser, I would like to include a screenshot,

If any of you have access, I need the following:
256-color GIF

showing URL: gopher://wings.buffalo.edu/hh/wny/images/
	(some shameless promotion! :-)

I have chimera, X-Mosaic, and Lynx.  I would like any others, for any
platform.

Put the file on an HTTP, gopher, or FTP server, and mail me the URL (I don't
have my MIME mail working).  Also, I want a _single_ paragraph, highlighting
its features.

Thanks for all your help,

                                          Daniel W. Connolly <connolly@hal.com>
                                                                               
   When I began looking at HTML and WWW, it was difficult to tell exactly what
   HTML was, so I tried to develop a specification. That spec apparently hasn't
   solved much :-{ It failed to address a number of features essential to the
   successful deployment of HTML.
   
   But HTML is a couple years older now, and perhaps now we're in a position to
   see the majority of the issues clearly now. It has been suggested (see
   heretical suggestion[1]) that now is the time to take the current practice
   and capture it in a specification.
   
The Purpose of HTML

   If we take a step back and look at the purpose and requirements and such for
   HTML, I'd say the purpose of HTML is: to promote computer mediated
   communication between parties on the internet by representing information in
   terms of available hypermedia technology.
   
   The idea is that I use the tools available on my box to capture my ideas at
   a fairly high level, so that you can use the tools on your box to
   filter/navigate/display the ideas. And even though your tools and my tools
   are not exactly the same, there's a high degree of confidence that the ideas
   get through in-tact.
   
   So to me, the idea of deploying specialized HTML editors on all the various
   platforms makes HTML no better than RTF or PostScript -- the data is tied to
   the supporting code. This is not to discourage the development of
   specialized HTML tools, but to encourage interoperability between existing
   tools (MS Word, FrameMaker, emacs...) and HTML applications, and to
   discourage "creeping featurism" in HTML.
   
The Goals of an HTML Specification

   The goal of any HTML specification should be to promote that confidence in
   the fidelity of communications using HTML. This means:
   
      
      making it clear to authors what idioms are available to express their
      ideas
      
      making it clear to implementors how to interpret the HTML format so that
      authors' ideas will be represented faithfully
      
      keeping HTML simple enough that it can be implemented using readily
      available technology and processed interactively
      
      making HTML expressive enough that it can represent a useful majority of
      the contemporary communications idioms in this community
      
      making some allowance for expressing idioms not captured by the
      specification
      
      addressing relavent interoperability issues with other applications and
      technologies
      
HTML Architecture: SGML

   From HyperText Mark-up Language[2]:
   
       The WWW[3] system uses marked up text to represent a hypertext docu
     ment for transmision over the network. The hypertext markup language
     is an SGML[4] format.
     
   The costs and benefits of basing using SGML to define HTML have been
   discussed at great length. Simplifications have been suggested (see, for
   example, A thought on implementation...[5] and responses). But at this
   point, it appears that there is a clear requirement that an HTML document
   shall be a conforming SGML document[6].
   
   The benefits of using SGML to define HTML include:
   
      Given a formal definition of HTML in SGML (i.e. an html DTD[7]), the
      question of whether a document conforms to that definition can be
      determined by machine (e.g. by the SGMLs software package[8], or by
      various interactive SGML editing tools). This allows authors a certain
      degree of confidence that they have prepared a well-formed document, and
      supports goal #1.
      
      The SGML standard, combined with a DTD for HTML, defines an abstract
      parsing model for reducing an SGML document in source form to an abstract
      representation called the Entity Structure Information Set. This provides
      a basis for a common interpretation of HTML documents, in support of goal
      #2.
      
      SGML is designed for document interchange, and many vendors have seen the
      value in supporting SGML as an interchange option. This supports goal #6.
      
   The costs of using SGML to define HTML include:
   
      The SGML standard is an extremely dense document. It is not designed for
      easy reading. SGML documents, on the other hand, are largely transparent.
      But not completely. It is quite common to browse a number of SGML
      documents and reach intuitive conclusions that are inconsitent with the
      standard. This is in direct conflict with goal #2.
      
      There are mechanisms in SGML to support modularization (entities model
      the #include feature of C) conditional usage (marked sections model
      #ifdef fairly well) and macros (another usage of entities), but they
      involve more complexity than interactive processing (goal #3) would
      suggest.
      
Outstanding Issues in HTML

   The current working specification for HTML[9] does not faithfully represent
   contemporary practice as supported by applications such as Mosiac and Lynx.
   Nor do those applications give a precise definition for HTML.
   
   The following is a commentary on the current document in the form of an
   enumeration of the outstanding issues as I see them.
   
  STATUS OF FEATURES
  
   The current specification defines the following:
   
  Mainstream              All parsers must recognize these features.  Features
                         are mainstream unless otherwise mentioned.
                         
  Extra                   Standard HTML features which may safely be ignored by
                         parsers. It is legal to ignore these, treat the
                         contents as though the tags were not there. (e.g. EM,
                         and any undefined elements)
                         
  Obsolete                Not standard HTML.  Parsers should implement these
                         features as far as possible in order to preserve
                         back-compatibility with previous versions of this
                         specification.
                         
   On the one hand, authors would like to be certain that the markup they
   compose will be faithfully represented on the other end. On the other hand,
   information consumers should be able to filter and format documents as they
   please.
   
   Currently, a lot of markup is ignored by various pieces of software without
   any warning. It should be possible to determine whether a document uses any
   features outside the "Mainstream" or "Extra" set.
   
   Also, there is a need to represent features not specified by the standard.
   Pilot projects will want to represent non-standard features without causing
   interoperability problems with conforming implementations.
   
    Proposal
    
      Include a document type declaration in future HTML documents to be
      explicit about the features used, for example:
      

<DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//timbl info.cern.ch//DTD WWW HTML 2.1/EN">

      to refer to the ENglish version of the DTD named "WWW HTML 2.1" owned by
      "timbl info.cern.ch" (can't use @ in SGML public identifiers)
      
      or perhaps:
      

<DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "http://info.cern.ch/pub/doc/html-19940415.dtd">

      This implies splitting the HTML DTD into parts for use with SGML tools:
      (a) an SGML declaration, and (b) a document type declaration subset. This
      is consistent with the representations of DTDs for applications such as
      CALs and DocBook.
      
      It also implies specifying how to process documents that do not have the
      explicit <!DOCTYPE... markup.
      
       Reserve the symbols HTML.Minimal, HTML.Obsolete, HTML.Optional, and
      HTML.Nonstandard as "feature test macros." Enhance the DTD to represent
      each of these feature sets. For example, to test that a document uses
      only Minimal and Optional, but no Obsolete or Nonstandard features, one
      might invoke:
      

        sgmls -i Minimal -i Optional foo.html

      Require some warning or other indication to be given when markup is
      ignored. This includes unrecognized element and attribute names. These
      warnings can be suppressed at the explicit request of the user (this is
      just a form of filtering), but they should be on by default.
      
  MIME CHARACTER SETS
  
   The spec lists "charset" as an optional parameter in the HTML content type
   registration. It should be pointed out that the only possible values for
   charset in an HTML content type are "US-ASCII" and "ISO-Latin1." Using any
   other character set is meaningless, given that the document character set
   for HTML is ISO Latin-1.
   
  NEWLINES, PARAGRAPH BREAKS, AND <P>
  
   Folks have asked why the <p> tag is necessary at all -- why can't we just
   use a blank line like troff and TeX?
   
   First, it's too late to do that: there are too many documents with blank
   lines that don't indicate a paragraph break.
   
   Second, not everybody wants it that way: I'd like to be free to stick blank
   lines in lists and such without introducing paragram breaks.
   
   Third, the mechanism for expressing this in SGML, SHORTREF, introduces
   significant complexity to parsing HTML. It opens up a can of worms including
   <em/foo/ and other tricky parsing idioms.
   
   But I would like to introduce one change to the way P elements work: I'd
   like to make the P element a paragraph container rather than a paragraph
   separator. The only required change is to put a <p> tag at the beginning of
   every paragraph -- we can use the OMITTAG feature to make </p> tags
   implicit. It makes for a much cleaner DTD in many ways, and it just makes
   more sense.
   
  CENTERING AND OTHER FORMATTING
  
   The traditional strategy for formatting SGML documents is to mark up the
   structure of the document and map that structure onto a set of formatting
   features.
   
   It so happens that after we had exhausted the structural distinctions we
   needed for HTML, there were several formatting distinctions that were not
   expressible through structural markup.
   
   The traditional solution to this situation is to introduce processing
   instructions, e.g.
   

...

<!-- Crud... this header gets widowed at the bottom of the
page. I'll just jimmy it with a page break...-->
<? newpage>

<H2>Header Two</h2>

   I suggest we introduce a whole set of processing instructions so that folks
   can mark up the formatting of their document without affecting the
   structure.
   
   For example, rather than the <BR> element, I'd suggest a <? linebreak>
   processing instruction, and a &br; entity as a shorthand form.
   
   The &nbsp; is another wierd one -- it's currently defined as &#32;, which is
   indistinguishable from a normal " " character in a conforming
   implementation. A "structure controlled application" never sees the entities
   until they're expanded, so it can't tell &nbsp; from a normal space
   character.
   
   It's fortunate that &nbsp; is an entity, though -- unlike the <BR> idiom,
   there's no change necessary to the documents themselves -- just to the DTD
   and applications. The set of processing instrcutions should cover:
   
       List styles
      
       Line breaks
      
       Page breaks
      
       Centering, justification
      
       Other RTF-style idioms
      
  STRUCTURE
  
   The text of the current spec says very little about the order and occurence
   of elements within the BODY element.
   
   Are lists allowed within lists? The DTD says no, but Mosaic supports it and
   the LaTeX->HTML converters I've seen make good use of it.
   
   Is STRONG allowed within EM? Are anchors allowed inside anchors? Can an
   anchor span paragraphs?
   
   Are P, LI, DT and DD empty or do they contain stuff? (I'm now of the opinion
   that they should contain stuff).
   
   I'm working on a DTD that mirrors the set of combinations that Mosiac seems
   to support. I'm also generating a test suite so we can see what the other
   browsers do, and so future implementors will have a concrete place to start.
   But there are a lot of subtleties to get through here.
   
   I think it's important to keep interoperability in mind here: we don't want
   to make it impossible to convert HTML to RTF. But then, there's a lot of
   value in being able to represent LaTeX style constructs the way Mosaic does
   rather than the way the linemode version of WWW does.
   
  NAVIGATION IDIOMS
  
   I've seen several collections of nodes that represent a sort of "toolbar"
   including Next, Previous, Up, Contents, Index, etc. ... There should be a
   way of labelling these things so that a browser could grab that stuff out of
   the text flow and implement it with an integrated user-interface feature
   like a button bar or the like.
   
  PUBLICATION IDIOMS
  
   The same goes for author, last modified, etc. A WWW browser should be able
   to implement a "Reply..." menu item which is active iff it spots author info
   in the node.
   
   Also, we should realize that HTML nodes get "published" much like email
   messages, and as such, it should be required that they have the equivalent
   of the RFC822 From:, To:, Date:, and possibly Message-Id: headers.
   
   These elements can and should be automated, and it should be possible for a
   node to say "I'm published as part of node XXX... get author and status info
   there."
   
  RELIABLE LINKS
  
   I'll take this opportunity to argue once again that content type info should
   be allowed in a link. I've made numerous links to compressed tar archives,
   and I routinely get mail about "why does Mosaic display gibberish when I
   click on the 'compressed tar file' link?"
   
   I think it's time to support more traditional SGML idioms for linking, for
   example:
   

<A HREF="#z12">
<A HREF="foo.html#z12">
<A HREF="http://host.com/foo.html#z12">

   becomes
   

<A IDREF="z12">
<A NEIGHBOR="foo.html" FRAGMENT="z12">
<A RESOURCE="http://host.com/foo.html" fragment="z12">

   or better yet, start supporting HyTime ala...
   

<url id="u1">http://host.com/foo.html</url>
<nameloc locsrc="u1" id="z12">z12</nameloc>
<A linkend="z12">

  "OWNERSHIP" OF THE STANDARD
  
   The most recent publication of the HTML specification was an internet draft:
   

  "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): A Representation of Textual
  Information and MetaInformation for Retrieval and
  Interchange",07/23/1993, <draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt, .ps>

   under the IIIR (Integration of Internet Information Resources) working group
   of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).
   
   Making HTML an internet standards-track RFC involves more overhead than is
   warrented. In the future, the HTML specification will be published as
   informational RFCs (FYI documents) from the WWW team at CERN.
   
Future Directions in HTML

   The following issues should remain apart from the immenent HTML standard.
   
  FORMS, TABLES, AND MATH
  
   I think forms should be a separate document type. I don't see a requirement
   to be able to include forms inside arbitrary documents. And I see more value
   in separating them from the normal HTML document type.
   
   The same goes for tables, math, and small inline images. Rather than trying
   to squeeze these into the HTML DTD, we need a way to transmit multiple MIME
   body parts in one transaction.
   
  MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER SETS
  
   Some folks have employed techniques for encoding multibyte character sets in
   HTML[10]. They point out the interaction between multibyte characters and
   SGML delimiter recognition. The SGML standard way to resolve this is to use
   a different document character set in the SGML declaraction for HTML. This
   places extra requirements on all SGML parsers used for such documents.
   
    Proposal
    
   Explain the use of SGML declarations for use with multibyte character sets
   in the spec.
   
  MARKED SECTIONS
  
   This is SGML's equivalent of #ifdef in C. It may be worth supporting them
   for a variety of reasons -- one of which is that we're non-conforming unless
   we do! But in order for them to be really useful, we'd have to support the
   #define equivalent too: entity declarations. For example:
   

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "..." [
<!ENTITY hal-site "IGNORE" -- gets redefined as "INCLUDE" within HaL -->
]>
... <![ &hal-site; [ For folks at hal only: here's the phone
number: 555-1212 ]]>

  LARGE DOCUMENTS
  
   I've heard gross things about folks using cpp and other hacks to deal with
   the problem of organizing large HTML documents. And we have no common way to
   aggregate a collection of HTML nodes to, for example, print them.
   
  STYLE SHEETS AND MULTIPLE DTDS
  
   In the long run, we should be headed toward a system that accomodates a

<h1>Toward Closure on HTML</h1>

<p>When I began looking at HTML and WWW, it was difficult to tell exactly
what HTML was, so I tried to develop a specification. That spec
apparently hasn't solved much :-{ It failed to address a number of
features essential to the successful deployment of HTML.

<p>But HTML is a couple years older now, and perhaps now we're in a
position to see the majority of the issues clearly now. It has been
suggested (see <a
href=3D"http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-talk-1994q1.messages/=
1056.html"><cite>heretical
suggestion</cite></a>) that now is the time to take the current
practice and capture it in a specification.

<h2>The Purpose of HTML</h2>

<p>If we take a step back and look at the purpose and requirements and
such for HTML, I'd say the purpose of HTML is:

<strong>to promote computer mediated communication between parties on
the internet by representing information in terms of available
hypermedia technology.
</strong>

<p>The idea is that I use the tools available on my box to capture my
ideas at a fairly high level, so that you can use the tools on your
box to filter/navigate/display the ideas. And even though your tools
and my tools are not exactly the same, there's a high degree of
confidence that the ideas get through in-tact.

<p>So to me, the idea of deploying specialized HTML editors on all the
various platforms makes HTML no better than RTF or PostScript -- the
data is tied to the supporting code. This is not to discourage the
development of specialized HTML tools, but to encourage
interoperability between existing tools (MS Word, FrameMaker,
emacs...) and HTML applications, and to discourage "creeping
featurism" in HTML.

<h2>The Goals of an HTML Specification</h2>

<p>The goal of any HTML specification should be to promote that
confidence in the fidelity of communications using HTML. This means:
<ol>
	<li>making it clear to authors what idioms are available
to express their ideas
	<li>making it clear to implementors how to interpret the
HTML format so that authors' ideas will be represented faithfully
	<li>keeping HTML simple enough that it can be implemented
using readily available technology and processed interactively
	<li>making HTML expressive enough that it can represent
a useful majority of the contemporary communications idioms in
this community
	<li>making some allowance for expressing idioms not captured
by the specification
	<li>addressing relavent interoperability issues with other
applications and technologies
</ol>

<h2>HTML Architecture: SGML</h2>

<p>From <A
HREF=3D"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html"><CITE>HyperT=
ext
Mark-up Language</CITE></A>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <A
NAME=3D"0" HREF=3D"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">WWW<=
/A> system uses marked up text
to represent a hypertext document
for transmision over the network.
The hypertext markup language is
an <A
NAME=3D"7" HREF=3D"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/SGML.html">SGM=
L</A> format.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- I should be able to use relative links within the above quote... -->

<p>The costs and benefits of basing using SGML to define HTML have
been discussed at great length. Simplifications have been suggested
(see, for example, <a
href=3D"http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-talk-1994q1.messages/=
632.html"><cite>A
thought on implementation...</cite></a> and responses). But at this
point, it appears that there is a clear requirement that <strong>an
HTML document shall be a <A
HREF=3D"sgml-excerpts.html#SGML4.51"><CITE>conforming SGML
document</CITE>
</a>.</strong>

<p>The benefits of using SGML to define HTML include:

<ul>
<li>Given a formal definition of HTML in SGML (i.e. an html <a
HREF=3D"sgml-excerpts.html#SGML4.105">DTD</a>), the question of whether a
document conforms to that definition can be determined by machine
(e.g. by the <a href=3D"ftp://ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/SGMLS/">SGMLs software
package</a>, or by various interactive SGML editing tools). This
allows authors a certain degree of confidence that they have prepared
a well-formed document, and supports goal #1.

<li>The SGML standard, combined with a DTD for HTML, defines an
abstract parsing model for reducing an SGML document in source form to
an abstract representation called the Entity Structure Information
Set. This provides a basis for a common interpretation of HTML
documents, in support of goal #2.

<li>SGML is designed for document interchange, and many vendors have
seen the value in supporting SGML as an interchange option. This
supports goal #6.

</ul>

<p>The costs of using SGML to define HTML include:

<ul>

<li>The SGML standard is an extremely dense document. It is not
designed for easy reading. SGML documents, on the other hand, are
largely transparent. But not completely. It is quite common to browse
a number of SGML documents and reach intuitive conclusions that are
inconsitent with the standard. This is in direct conflict with goal
#2.

<li>There are mechanisms in SGML to support modularization (entities
model the #include feature of C) conditional usage (marked sections
model #ifdef fairly well) and macros (another usage of entities), but
they involve more complexity than interactive processing (goal #3)
would suggest.

</ul>


<h2>Outstanding Issues in HTML</h2>

<p>The current working <a
HREF=3D"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html">specification
for HTML</a> does not faithfully represent contemporary practice as
supported by applications such as Mosiac and Lynx. Nor do those
applications give a precise definition for HTML.

<p>The following is a commentary on the current document in the form
of an enumeration of the outstanding issues as I see
them.

<h3>Status of features</h3>

<p>The current specification defines the following:

<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=3D"z2">Mainstream</A>
<DD> All parsers must recognize
these features.  Features are mainstream
unless otherwise mentioned.
<DT><A
NAME=3D"z5">Extra</A>
<DD> Standard HTML features which
may safely be ignored by parsers.
It is legal to ignore these, treat
the contents as though the tags were
not there. (e.g. EM, and any undefined
elements)
<DT><A
NAME=3D"z8">Obsolete</A>
<DD> Not standard HTML.  Parsers
should implement these features as
far as possible in order to preserve
back-compatibility with previous
versions of this specification.
</DL>

<p>On the one hand, authors would like to be certain that the markup
they compose will be faithfully represented on the other end. On the
other hand, information consumers should be able to filter and format
documents as they please.

<p>Currently, a lot of markup is ignored by various pieces of
software without any warning. It should be possible to determine
whether a document uses any features outside the "Mainstream" or
"Extra" set.

<p>Also, there is a need to represent features not specified by the
standard. Pilot projects will want to represent non-standard features
without causing interoperability problems with conforming
implementations.

<H4>Proposal</h4>

<ol>
<li>Include a document type declaration in future HTML documents to be
explicit about the features used, for example:

<pre>
&lt;DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//timbl info.cern.ch//DTD WWW HTML 2.1/EN"&gt;
</pre>

<P>to refer to the ENglish version of the DTD named "WWW HTML 2.1"
owned by "timbl info.cern.ch" (can't use @ in SGML public identifiers)

<P>or perhaps:

<pre>
&lt;DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "http://info.cern.ch/pub/doc/html-19940415.dtd"&gt=
;
</pre>

<p>This implies splitting the HTML DTD into parts for use with SGML
tools: (a) an SGML declaration, and (b) a document type declaration
subset. This is consistent with the representations of DTDs for
applications such as CALs and DocBook.

<p>It also implies specifying how to process documents that do not
have the explicit <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE...</code> markup.

<LI> Reserve the symbols HTML.Minimal, HTML.Obsolete, HTML.Optional,
and HTML.Nonstandard as "feature test macros." Enhance the DTD to
represent each of these feature sets. For example, to test that a
document uses only Minimal and Optional, but no Obsolete or
Nonstandard features, one might invoke:

<pre>
	sgmls -i Minimal -i Optional foo.html
</pre>

<LI>Require some warning or other indication to be given when markup
is ignored. This includes unrecognized element and attribute names.
These warnings can be suppressed at the explicit request of the user
(this is just a form of filtering), but they should be on by default.

</ol>

<h3>MIME Character sets</h3>

<P>The spec lists "charset" as an optional parameter in the HTML
content type registration. It should be pointed out that the only
possible values for charset in an HTML content type are "US-ASCII" and
"ISO-Latin1." Using any other character set is meaningless, given that
the document character set for HTML is ISO Latin-1.

<h3>Newlines, Paragraph breaks, and &lt;P&gt;</h3>
<!-- @@blank lines for paragraph breaks -->

<P>Folks have asked why the &lt;p&gt; tag is necessary at all -- why
can't we just use a blank line like troff and TeX?

<P>First, it's too late to do that: there are too many documents with
blank lines that <EM>don't</EM> indicate a paragraph break.

<P>Second, not everybody wants it that way: I'd like to be free to
stick blank lines in lists and such without introducing paragram
breaks.

<p>Third, the mechanism for expressing this in SGML, SHORTREF,
introduces significant complexity to parsing HTML. It opens up a can
of worms including <CODE>&lt;em/foo/</CODE> and other tricky parsing
idioms.

<p>But I would like to introduce one change to the way P elements
work: I'd like to make the P element a paragraph container rather than
a paragraph separator. The only required change is to put a &lt;p&gt;
tag at the beginning of every paragraph -- we can use the OMITTAG
feature to make &lt;/p&gt; tags implicit. It makes for a much cleaner
DTD in many ways, and it just makes more sense.

<h3>Centering and other formatting</h3>

<P>The traditional strategy for formatting SGML documents is to mark
up the structure of the document and map that structure onto a set of
formatting features.

<P>It so happens that after we had exhausted the structural
distinctions we needed for HTML, there were several formatting
distinctions that were not expressible through structural markup.

<P>The traditional solution to this situation is to introduce
processing instructions, e.g.

<PRE>
...

&lt;!-- Crud... this header gets widowed at the bottom of the
page. I'll just jimmy it with a page break...--&gt;
&lt;? newpage&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;Header Two&lt;/h2&gt;
</PRE>

<P>I suggest we introduce a whole set of processing instructions so
that folks can mark up the formatting of their document without
affecting the structure.

<P>For example, rather than the <CODE>&lt;BR&gt;</CODE> element, I'd
suggest a <CODE>&lt;? linebreak&gt;</CODE> processing instruction, and
a <CODE>&amp;br;</CODE> entity as a shorthand form.

<P>The <CODE>&amp;nbsp;</CODE> is another wierd one -- it's currently
defined as <CODE>&amp;#32;</CODE>, which is indistinguishable from a
normal " " character in a conforming implementation. A "structure
controlled application" never sees the entities until they're
expanded, so it can't tell <CODE>&amp;nbsp;</CODE> from a normal space
character.

<P>It's fortunate that <CODE>&amp;nbsp;</CODE> is an entity, though --
unlike the <CODE>&lt;BR&gt;</CODE> idiom, there's no change necessary
to the documents themselves -- just to the DTD and applications.

The set of processing instrcutions should cover:

<UL>
<LI> List styles
<LI> Line breaks
<LI> Page breaks
<LI> Centering, justification
<LI> Other RTF-style idioms
</UL>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<P>The text of the current spec says very little about the order and
occurence of elements within the <CODE>BODY</CODE> element.

<P>Are lists allowed within lists? The DTD says no, but Mosaic
supports it and the LaTeX-&gt;HTML converters I've seen make good use
of it.

<P>Is <CODE>STRONG</CODE> allowed within <CODE>EM</CODE>? Are anchors
allowed inside anchors? Can an anchor span paragraphs?

<P>Are P, LI, DT and DD empty or do they contain stuff? (I'm now of
the opinion that they should contain stuff).

<P>I'm working on a DTD that mirrors the set of combinations that
Mosiac seems to support. I'm also generating a test suite so we can
see what the other browsers do, and so future implementors will have a
concrete place to start. But there are a lot of subtleties to get
through here.

<P>I think it's important to keep interoperability in mind here: we
don't want to make it impossible to convert HTML to RTF. But then,
there's a lot of value in being able to represent LaTeX style
constructs the way Mosaic does rather than the way the linemode
version of WWW does.

<h3>Navigation idioms</h3>

<p>I've seen several collections of nodes that represent a sort of
"toolbar" including Next, Previous, Up, Contents, Index, etc. ...
There should be a way of labelling these things so that a browser
could grab that stuff out of the text flow and implement it with an
integrated user-interface feature like a button bar or the like.

<h3>Publication Idioms</h3>

<p>The same goes for author, last modified, etc. A WWW browser should
be able to implement a "Reply..." menu item which is active iff it
spots author info in the node.

<P>Also, we should realize that HTML nodes get "published" much like
email messages, and as such, it should be required that they have the
equivalent of the RFC822 From:, To:, Date:, and possibly Message-Id:
headers.

<P>These elements can and should be automated, and it should be
possible for a node to say "I'm published as part of node XXX... get
author and status info there."

<h3>Reliable Links</h3>

<P>I'll take this opportunity to argue once again that content type
info should be allowed in a link. I've made numerous links to
compressed tar archives, and I routinely get mail about "why does
Mosaic display gibberish when I click on the 'compressed tar file'
link?"

<P>I think it's time to support more traditional SGML idioms for
linking, for example:

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF=3D"#z12"&gt;
&lt;A HREF=3D"foo.html#z12"&gt;
&lt;A HREF=3D"http://host.com/foo.html#z12"&gt;
</PRE>

<P>becomes

<PRE>
&lt;A IDREF=3D"z12"&gt;
&lt;A NEIGHBOR=3D"foo.html" FRAGMENT=3D"z12"&gt;
&lt;A RESOURCE=3D"http://host.com/foo.html" fragment=3D"z12"&gt;
</PRE>

<P>or better yet, start supporting HyTime ala...

<PRE>
&lt;url id=3D"u1"&gt;http://host.com/foo.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;nameloc locsrc=3D"u1" id=3D"z12"&gt;z12&lt;/nameloc&gt;
&lt;A linkend=3D"z12"&gt;
</PRE>

<h3>"Ownership" of the Standard</h3>

<p>The most recent publication of the HTML specification was an
internet draft:
<pre>
  "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): A Representation of Textual =

  Information and MetaInformation for Retrieval and =

  Interchange",07/23/1993, &lt;draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt, .ps&gt;
</pre>

<p>under the IIIR (Integration of Internet Information Resources) working
group of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).

<p>Making HTML an internet standards-track RFC involves more overhead
than is warrented. In the future, the HTML specification will be
published as informational RFCs (FYI documents) from the WWW team at
CERN.

<h2>Future Directions in HTML</h2>

<p>The following issues should remain apart from the immenent HTML
standard.

<h3>Forms, Tables, and Math</h3>

<P>I think forms should be a separate document type. I don't see a
requirement to be able to include forms inside arbitrary documents.
And I see more value in separating them from the normal HTML document
type.

<P>The same goes for tables, math, and small inline images. Rather
than trying to squeeze these into the HTML DTD, we need a way to
transmit multiple MIME body parts in one transaction.

<h3>Multi-byte character sets</h3>

<p>Some folks have employed <a
href=3D"http://www.ntt.jp/japan/note-on-JP/encoding.html">techniques for
encoding multibyte character sets in HTML</a>. They point out the
interaction between multibyte characters and SGML delimiter
recognition. The SGML standard way to resolve this is to use a
different document character set in the SGML declaraction for HTML.
This places extra requirements on all SGML parsers used for such
documents.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<p>Explain the use of SGML declarations for use with
multibyte character sets in the spec.

<h3>Marked Sections</h3>

<p>This is SGML's equivalent of <code>#ifdef</code> in C. It may be
worth supporting them for a variety of reasons -- one of which is that
we're non-conforming unless we do! But in order for them to be really
useful, we'd have to support the <code>#define</code> equivalent too:
entity declarations. For example:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "..." [
&lt;!ENTITY hal-site "IGNORE" -- gets redefined as "INCLUDE" within HaL --=
&gt;
]&gt;
... &lt;![ &amp;hal-site; [ For folks at hal only: here's the phone
number: 555-1212 ]]&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Large Documents</h3>

<P>I've heard gross things about folks using cpp and other hacks to
deal with the problem of organizing large HTML documents. And we have
no common way to aggregate a collection of HTML nodes to, for example,
print them.

<h3>Style Sheets and Multiple DTDs</h3>

<p>In the long run, we should be headed toward a system that accomodates
a variety of DTDs, using stylesheets somehow.

Four digits may not be enough, but it does seem likely
that we can use a fixed size field here. Let me explain.

I understand that one of the hottest topics in modern
cosmology today is the debate over just how much dark
matter is out there in the universe. What cosmologists want
to know is whether there is enough mass to eventually
reverse the current expansion of the universe ("enough"
being the layman's term for the needed amount.  The
correct cosmologists's technical term for this amount is
"billions and billions").

[* And of course as well-informed readers will know,
   current thinking in this field attributes the
   measureable expansion of the universe to the initial
   "Big Bang" ("grand explosion" in French, or "grosse
   kaboum" in German) which is believed to have occured at
   the birth of the universe. This expansion was first
   identified by the famous astronomer William Hubble, who
   is best know for his poor eyesight but who did at least
   have a keen sense of colour perception. For example, he
   was the first to identify the famous "Hubble Red Shift"
   in the early part of this century while helping his
   wife choose an outfit for a weekend outing.  But I
   digress... *]

Anyways, assuming there is sufficient mass to halt the
expansion of the universe the most likely scenario is that
the universe will eventually collapse back onto itself.
This obviously puts an outer limit on the amount of time we
need to allow for in the above URN scheme (and thus the
number of digits we need to accomodate). (Of course, it
also puts paid to any plans you might have had to arrange
a really effective long term backup strategy for your
site, but hey, who said systems administration would be
easy?)

Another possibility is that there is _not_ enough dark
matter to halt expansion of the universe. Here we would
probably be saved by the n'th law of Thermodynamics
("n'th" is used to indicate that I can't remember exactly
which one it is I mean here, so you have to figure it out
yourself). Basically, this law states that all closed
systems tend to entropy, which is a long-winded way of
telling us (so I'm told by all those really depressing
stories I keep reading in Discover magazine) that the
universe will eventually all end up spread out as a cold
and lifeless collection of widely spread out nothingness.

Brrrr...

Given this scenario, at some point there wouldn't be enough
energy left to power your machine, so there wouldn't be
any point in you actually storing any more URNs anyways.
Again, we don't know how long this would be yet, but since
we started with a finite amount of matter and it's
expanding (and cooling) at a finite rate, we've a finite
amount of time before you might as well unplug the machine
and go home.

Assuming we can calculate how long it takes to get
everything to cool down enough we can thus still put an
upper bound on the number of digits we need to allow for
(and I understand that now the superconducting
supercollider's been cancelled there are thousands of
out-of-work physicists who'd love to help with the
calculations on this in exchange for having their name on
the resulting paper. As the supercollider's budget showed,
these guys really love big numbers but I still think we're
talking a finite number of digits here).

The only possible wrinkle we can't rule out is if there is
_exactly_ enough dark matter out there to halt expansion
of the universe at some still useful point on the
thermodynamic power curve, but _not_ enough to cause
everything to collapse back down onto itself. I know this
sounds unlikely, but who'd have predicted the success of
MS-DOS ten years ago?  Given this existance proof of a
capricious and vengeful God, we can't rule this third
possibility out.

Still, covering two out of the three possible bases in a
version 1.0 URN still seems better than any of the other
proposals we've got kicking around right now. Besides, I
think we'll be proposing something that would last a bit
longer than the address space used in the initial version
of IP. And if turns out that MS-DOS wasn't a one-off
mistake, we can plan on fixing our problem using the same
technique they come up with for IPng.

  My proposal for funding the Internet is pretty simple. I vote we institute
  an "Information Superhighway" tax, the proceeds of which will be used to
  fund network infrastructure. The way this would work is simple - every time
  someone uses the words "Information Superhighway" or any of its derivatives
  we strike them with a sharp object and make them pay a $10 fee (of course,
  the sharp object is not actually needed to make this scheme work, it's just
  in there because it seems an appropriate thing to do...)

Doesn't that largely defeat the purpose of this intermediate  
standardization effort, if you ignore key Mosaic features like inline  
images and interactive forms?  The outstanding success of Mosaic has  
given us a wonderful and rare opportunity to standardize on its  
advances, before any major splintering takes place.  Why does  
everyone here seem determined to squander that opportunity?

What's different this time?  The current mainstream success of the  
Web has a lot to do with Mosaic's graphical and interactive features.   
What these features need most right now is some kind of base-level  
standard so that they can be used reliably.

I guess Marc is more of a heretic than I realized.

CERN httpd is a generic hypertext server which can be used as a
regular HTTP server running typically on port 80 to serve hypertext
and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a firewall
machine -- that provides with access for people inside a firewall to
the outside world.  When running as proxy httpd may be configured to
do caching of documents.  Caching is still in beta test phase.

CERN httpd 2.17beta is released, source code from:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/cern_httpd.tar.Z

This package includes EVERYTHING, so don't ftp the libwww.
Precompiled binaries are supplied for:

  Sun4: 	     ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/sun4
  Solaris:	     ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/solaris
  HP:		     ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/snake
  NeXT:		     ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next
  Fat NeXT-386:	     ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next-386
  DecStation Ultrix: ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/decstation
  DEC OSF/1:	     ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/dec-osf1

Precompiled binaries are all in cern_httpd_bins.tar.Z, which also
includes a default set of icons, and sample configuration files for
normal and proxy use.  README file is now also up-to-date, and may be
useful reading.

For Sun4 there is also a cern_httpd_bins-lresolv.tar.Z which contains
an httpd linked with the -lresolv option.

Compilation for other Unix platforms should not be very complicated.
I would be happy to receive diffs, if any, to make it compile for
other platforms.  Also binaries other than those already on
info.cern.ch are welcome.

Current VMS version is 2.16beta.

                   CERN HTTPD 2.17BETA RELEASE NOTES
 
General New Features
 
     * PUT and POST can be configured to be handled by external CGI
       scripts; PUT-Script and POST-Script directives
     * BodyTimeOut for timing out scripts waiting for input that never
       comes from clients
     * IdentityCheck directive to turn on RFC931 remote login name
       checking
     * REMOTE_IDENT for CGI giving remote login name; this was the only
       feature missing to be fully CGI/1.0 compiant
     * CGI/1.1 upgrade:
          + all the headers without a special meaning to CGI from CGI
            scripts get passed to the client
          + Status: header to specify the HTTP status code and message
            for client when not using NPH scripts
          + all HTTP request header lines which are not otherwise
            available to the scripts get passed as HTTP_XXX_YYY
            environment variables
     * Understands conditional GET request with If-Modified-Since header
     * kill -HUP causes httpd to re-read its configuration file
     * PidFile directive for specifying the file to write the process id
       [makes it easy to send the HUP signal
     * ServerRoot directive to specify a "home directory" for httpd
     * Directory listings with icons; by default icons are in icons
       subdirectory under ServerRoot
     * The precompiled binaries are distributed in a tar packet that
       contains a set of default icons; the easiest way to configure the
       icons is to just set the ServerRoot to point to the binary
       distribution directory [its name is cern_httpd]
     * Welcome directive to specify the name of the overview page of the
       directory; default values are Welcome.html, welcome.html and, for
       compatibility with NCSA server, index.html. Use of Welcome
       directive will override all the defaults.
     * AlwaysWelcome directive to configure if /directory and /directory/
       are to be taken to mean the same thing, or should only /directory/
       be mapped to the overview page and /directory produce the
       directory listing.
     * /~user causes an automatic redirection to /~user/
     * Now gives also the Date: header.
     * Port directive to config file specifying the port number to listen
       to.
 
Access Authorization Enhancements / Proxy Protections
 
     * Now also domain name templates, like *.cern.ch, can be used in
       specifying allowed hosts, not only IP number masks
     * ACLOverRide directive to allow ACLs to override the Masks set in
       the protection setup [without this feature ACLs cannot allow
       anything more than what the Masks allow, only restrict access
       further]. This directive disables Mask checking if an ACL file is
       present.
     * Since setting up protection seemed to be unnecessarily hard, it is
       now possible to give the protection setup in the main
       configuration file instead of having to use a different file; it
       is still ok to use a different file.
          + Protection directive defines a protection setup and
            associates a name with it:
 
        Protection  prot-name  {
                AuthType    Basic
                ServerId    Test-Server
                PasswdFile  /where/ever/passwd
                GroupFile   /where/ever/group
                UserId      someuser
                GroupId     somegroup
                GET-Mask    list, of, users, and, groups
                POST-Mask   list, of, users, and, groups
                PUT-Mask    list, of, users, and, groups
        }
 
        The content between the curly braces is the same as used to go
            the the protection setup file. What's new is the possibility
            to specify the UserId and GroupId for the clild process when
            serving the request in protected mode. This is not possible
            with external files for security reasons [it is not possible
            inside the external file, but it is not possible if the ids
            are set when calling that file; see doc for more details].
          + A single Mask directive for cases when GET-Mask, POST-Mask
            and PUT-Mask are the same.
          + In Protect rule the prot-name is specified instead of the
            file name; what's more is that Protect can now be used to
            protect also proxied URLs:
 
                Protect http:*   prot-name
                Protect ftp:*    prot-name
                Protect gopher:* prot-name
 
Enhancements, Fixes
 
     * Incorporated Ian Dunkin's <imd1707@ggr.co.uk> SOCKS modifications
       (thank you, Ian!); read the README-SOCKS file in the source code
       distribution for more information.
     * SIGPIPE causes a normal child to exit; proxy child will correctly
       stop writing to client socket but still writes to cache file
       [previously just kept on writing to the socket, too]
     * 401, 402, 403, 404 errors don't go to error log anymore
     * error log contains now the host name and request
     * no longer sends Content-Transfer-Encoding, we agreed upon using
       Content-Encoding for compression
     * fixed funny panic message from format module in verbose mode even
       though everything was ok [only aesthetic]
     * now gives again "not authorized" rather than not found if trying
       to access a protected but nonexistant file; this way even
       filenames don't leak
     * all time specifications in configuration file have more readable
       forms:
  
        1 year
        2 months
        3 weeks 2 days
        5 days 20 hours 30 mins 2 secs
        20:30
        20:30:01
        2 weeks 20:30
 
     * Case-sense bug with LogTime, LogFormat, DirAccess and DirReadme
       fixed; now paramters really are handled in a case-insensitive
       manner.
 
Proxy Additions, Fixes
 
     * Proxy protections, see above
     * Made proxy do smart guesses about the content of an unknown file
       while retrieving from the remote; this will end the problems of
       some files not being transferred to WinMosaic or Lynx. IMPORTANT:
       Everybody, remove the rule [if you have it]:

        AddType  *.*  text/plain

   because it would disable this smart feature.
     * Fixed a bug with unknown binary gopher files being truncated
     * Fixed the bug with trailing slashes in ftp directory listings
     * Fixed the bug with requests not being URL-encoded when forwarding
       the request
     * Fixed a bug with filenames in directory listings not being
       URL-encoded
     * Fixed stupid "mail-us" situation in certain situations when ftp
       load fails
 
Proxy Caching
 
     * Cache is refreshed using the conditional GET method [use of
       If-Modified-Since header]
     * Standalone cache mode with CacheNoConnect directive [causes an
       error rather than document fetch when the document is not in the
       cache]
     * Possibility to disable garbage collection altogether
     * Possibility to disable expiry checking
     * Caching Off to explicitly turn off caching even if there are other
       caching directives specified
     * -gc_only command line option to do garbage collection as a cron
       job for sites that run httpd as a proxy from inetd. However, since
       httpd now re-reads its configuration files when it receives a HUP
       signal, it makes standalone operation now even more easy, and
       inetd should no longer be much more convenient.
     * Host names are converted to all-lower-case to avoid doing multiple
       caching for a single site.
     * Files expiring immediately never get written to the cache; not
       even part of it.
     * By default HTTP-retrieved documents without an Expires: and
       Last-Modified: field never get cached [because they are usually
       generated by scripts and should never be cached]; therefore I
       strongly advice against the use of CacheDefaultExpiry for HTTP.
     * Caching control directives have changed to take a URL template as
       a first argument, and a more readable time format:

        CacheDefaultExpiry  ftp:*     2 weeks 4 days
        CacheDefaultExpiry  gopher:*  6 days
        CacheUnused         http:*    1 month
        CacheUnused         ftp:*     2 weeks
        CacheUnused         gopher:*  1 week 5 days 2 hours 1 min 30 secs
 
     * Made the expiry date approximation configurable; by default
       documents with Last-Modified: but without Expires: expire after
       10% of the time that they have been unmodified.
       CacheLastModifiedfactor can be used to change this value, or turn
       this feature Off. Default value is 0.1 [=10%].
     * Understands yet another date format:
 
        Thu, 10 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT
 
   This date format is not conforming to the spec, so use of it is
       discouraged! This is only to make the proxy more robust.
     * NoCaching directive to prevent certain URLs from being cached at
       all.
     * Time margin to get rid of problems with machine clocks having
       inaccurate times and confusing caching.
     * GcDailyGc to specify a daily garbage collection time, by default
       3:00. [Can be turned Off, too.]
     * Now possible to disable GcReqInterval and GcTimeInterval [by
       default disabled].
     * Expired cache lock files get removed also during gc.
     * CacheAccessLog to specify a different log file for cache accesses;
       also possible to make a separate log for each remote host.
 
cgiutils
 
   A new product cgiutils for producing HTTP1 replies from CGI scripts,
   and for easily generating the Expires: header given the time to live,
   e.g. "2 weeks 4 hours 30 mins".  See:

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/CGI/cgiutils.html

  This is a pair for the cgiparse program used to parse the input for
  CGI scripts:

One thing I forgot to mention: if you are already using proxy caching
clear your cache before running the new httpd version.  This will keep
httpd from going bananas and will also take care of files that were
given too a long lifetime by the old version.

No no no a thousand times no absolutely not.  This is completely out
of the question and conflicts severely with current practice.  Making
forms a "separate document type" would grievously wound WWW as it now
exists.

If you don't see this, please look harder.

Likewise for inlined images.

I'm not sufficiently familiar with the standards-track, to judge how
much overhead there would be. However, I have some concerns about
FYI's:

- My impression is that FYI's aren't standards. Not having something
  marked as an international standard will seriously hamper acceptance
  by corporate people. While some might consider this a feature I
  think it would be nice to create an environment where we can have
  supported and financed products and services.

- Becuase FYI don't go through the standards process they are not as
  fixed, and could be updated anytime. While some might consider this
  a feature because it allows good ideas to flourish, it makes it
  impossible to write compliant documents and software (ie the situation
  we're in now).

- Because they are posted by a particular group they aren't
  independent. This puts a burden on that group, and could mean the
  standard evolves in a particular way not optimally beneficial to the
  community at large. (I know they're good guys, I do, honest.)

I would really like to have RFC's for HTTP/HTML/HTML+, with defined
forums to discuss issues, ensured follow-ups, and defined time
schedules for actually deciding on something.

So as not to assume that the WAIS request is always coming from a WWW client
I will probably do all this with a WAIS gateway and WAIS server scripts. 
I hope that I can get it smart enough to then regenerate metadata files when 
a hit is made. Then these could be picked up by the Multiformat Opportunity
of the client. These metadata files would then be regularly re-indexed 
rather than do the keywords caper.

HTML is not yet at the point where it should be regarded
as cast in stone. An incompatible would-be successor HTML+
is already on the horizon. Now is the time to consider
such changes.

This is a non-issue. LaTeX has a perfectly reasonable approach to
ignoring extra paragraph breaks in list contexts; use that.

In other words, you would rather have a language that is convenient
to parse than one that is convenient to use. Big mistake. The 
<p> ... </p> construct is a big step in the wrong direction: it makes
a simple construct like a paragraph, which was already well handled
by a text-editor, into something onerous. It is not clear that your
ommittag fix is backward compatible, since it suggests <p>'s at the
front of paragraphs instead of at the back; if an incompatible
change like this is possible, then why not double-\n? But the
bigger issue is that you are ignoring user preferences in favor
of anal-retentive coder preferences: no one but a parser-writer
would view <p> ... </p> as an elegant way to say "this is a
paragraph. Similarly for <li>, etc. If we have a system that works
with one level of syntactic nuisance, what possible motive
could there be for making a change whose sole effect is to increase
the level of syntactic nuisance? You are only creating a niche for
someone to fill with a user-oriented  HTML-Lite, just as LaTeX
replaced the essentially unusable TeX.

   The great thing about the HTML+ DTD is ... get ready... it is actually
parseable by commercial (and free) SGML editors/validators.  Unlike the old
html spec.  So, hopefully more and more people will start using these
tools, and they won't have to worry about the 'oh-so-inconvenient' tags.

>But the bigger issue is that you are ignoring user preferences in favor of

><li>, etc.

  How's this for a proposal:

1. Get rid of <p> tag and replace it with double-\n
2. Get rid of <li> tag and replace it with \t*
3. Get rid of <dd> tag and replace it with \n
4. Get rid of <dt> tag and replace it with \t*
5. etc
6. etc

   That would increase the readability of the text immensely.

Don't get heated over paragraphs - the logic is clear!

HTML currently gives you:

    a)  paragraph breaks with <P>
    b)  forced line breaks with <BR>

In HTML+ existing documents will display OK as browsers can
infer any missing <P> tags,  and the </P> tags *AREN'T NEEDED*

You also get the option to left/center/right align paragraphs and
to name each paragraph with a unique ID for link destinations.
This brings the web into step with common document formats, e.g.
Microsoft Word, and Framemaker which treat paragraphs as distinct
objects with defined properties. All other SGML formats work this
way too!

if we have to wait till 2009 for a draft of the IETF URI group,
why not wait until the year 9999 to change a preliminary draft?
Or take the julian calendar right now for referencing all events,
this makes more sense (at least for parsing and computation) than
a RFC for timestamps which has to be changed in 9999 as well.

I didn't mean to leave out the <IMG> tag -- I meant that we shouldn't
standardize on a way to stick GIFs in the _same_datastream_ as
HTML, somethin like:
	<inline-img>23l4i23o487234oiu23o4ijo23i4j</inline-img>

The <img> element will certainly stay in the std.

I'm not quite sure what to do with forms. But what I'm suggesting
is that normal text/html _not_ include forms -- we make a separate
type application/html-form or some such and another DTD that includes
the form elements (plus most of the normal HTML elements).

Forms don't fit several requrements that I had in mind:
	* One should be able to write an HTML->RTF converter. What
	happens to forms there?
	* What happens when forms get printed?

But I don't mean to be adamant about anything. If there's a clear
consensus on how forms work, I'm all for it, I guess.

I guess I just haven't worked with them enough to know _exactly_ how
expressive they are.

Dan,

A major reason for keeping forms and html together is the way html
elements are used to layout forms. You can use most things including
PRE to layout the fields and surrounding text and images. This makes
it kind of tricky to say the least to separate them. Besides there is
now a lot of experience with fill-out forms and this is being fed into
further developments. Going back to ground zero would be a retrograde step.

What we really need is some work on a MIME multipart/related format
for transferring form contents, as the current URL based approach is
running out of steam. This is essential for new fields types such as
audio, scribble (scribble on image) and file transfer. Would you like
to help with this?

I believe it is quite an issue. Would you care to construct an SGML
document demonstrating this style of markup? I think you'll find it's
non-trivial (but I think it is possible...)

Well, I am trying to keep interactive processing in mind. Big mistake?
I dunno. There are much simpler syntactic idioms that are incorrectly
implemented in several browsers. This is the big mistake, if you
ask me.

Well, I agree it's desirable. I just haven't been able to work out
a reasonable representation in SGML. If you've got one handy, let's
see it.

Which html spec lacked a DTD? I have several versions, including
the one from info.cern.ch that work fine (except that documents

Now if we do this, folks will _have_ to start using SGML parsers
to validate documents when they write them, and they'll _have_ to
use real SGML parsers at runtime. This stuff _can_ be represented
with SGML SHORTREFs, but I don't think you'd like the situation
you'd end up with -- one misplaced '*' character could screw up
the whole parse.

But the biggest problem with introducing shortrefs at this point is
that we'd really want to wait until they were implemented and used for
a while before we could standardize them. Now is not the time for
that, I'd say.

Two thumbs up ! True/Full MIME support is the way to go, not just
for transferring form contents but essentially todo everything
(Request/Response) that goes on between a web client and the server.
Who's volunteering to write code ?

I don't think so. I've seen lots of pages that say "You'll need a WWW
client that understands forms to use this..." I think current practice
most certainly does include the notion of labelling forms-using pages
as such.

How so?

An HTTP client, for example, is requried to handle HTML. If we make
forms part of HTML, then all HTTP clients will have to grok forms. I
suggest that forms should be an optional feature. A client should
send:

	Accept: application/html-form

to announce that it groks forms.

Ok. :-)

>Likewise for inlined images.

I misspoke on inlined images. There's nothing wrong with the IMG
element. But I think we need a way to combine image/gif data and
text/html data into one transaction. But that technique is not
ready for standardization yet. That's what I meant.

With all due respect to Tim and the CERN team, I am currently dubious
of the idea that they will have the time to pursue this at the level I
think a lot of us feel it deserves (standards-track or not).  I feel
the community should do what it can to distribute the effort involved.

Prologue: It would be better if people refrained from flaming
and ad-hominum attacks.  I don't agree with everything
Dan proposes but he's trying to do the right thing and
people should show real reasons for their objections, and
treat his ideas with respect.

Now here are mine:

1) clarifying question: Dan do you assume that in the future
people will not write directly in HTML using text editors, but
rather will write in other languages that get translated to
HTML or will be using fancy editors that generate the HTML
for you?  
  => If so, and if he's right, then this changes the language
design.  The key issues become making HTML expressive and easily
parsed.  So this is the fundamental assumption we should debate.

  => How widely available *are* these tools?  Are we talking Microsoft
Word here, or the SGMLs tools?

2) including explicit DOCTYPE is a good idea.

3) I can see no benefit whatsoever to making an incompatible change
to the anchor syntax.  But this depends in a major way on the
key Assumption (#1 above).  Here's why:
  it is a terrible idea to have anchors  stored inline in the text. 
     The reason is that to add an anchor to a document, you must have
     write permission on the document.  Thus inline anchors prevent me
     from linking to or from anything I dont own.  The Hyper-G people
     make this argument well.
   Inline anchors are okay if HTML is only used as a transmission standard,
   and not as a permanent storage standard.  We can store the anchors 
   separately, and add them in when the document is send across the net.

  but if people end up writing "naked" HTML, then they will have inline
  anchors permanently in the text.  if they use tools, then *maybe* the
  anchors can be stored external.  And if they use tools, then nobody
  sees raw HTML.

4) There is a large demand from the user community for inline tables
and images.  If HTML does not provide these, people will stop using HTML.
(I do not know how much demand there is for inline math)

5) as for the claim that forms should be a separate DTD - I don't see
the benefit.  HTML with forms is rapidly becoming a powerful way to
implement application interfaces.  there is a big demand for this feature.
Indeed, I expect it to grow - The current forms behavior is a step
towards fully programmable clients, and we may go that direction.  When
HTML is used in this way, it becomes something different from SGML +
hyperlinks.  You argue that you can't print a form, well so much the
worse for printing.  Eventually hypermedia has to become something
BETTER than mere paper, better than paper with cross-links.  it is
folly to remove working features from the language just because they
run only on silicon, not cellulose.

The point I was making in my somewhat abrupt earlier messages is that
it has in fact turned out that people have found a multitude of uses
for forms inside ordinary documents, and being able to provide that
functionality was a big step forward.  I can provide example URLs if
it would be helpful.

There are basically three languages we can define:

(a) HTML "pure"; no forms.
(b) HTML "pure" + forms; I call this "current practice", and this is
    what I'm encouraging should be frozen long enough to be shipped
    out as an informational RFC.
(c) HTML+.

I think (b) is the most important to lock down at this point in the
project, because it documents and semi-standardizes something that has
achieved widespread use (there are somewhere around 1,000,000 users of
browsers that support or almost support (b) at this point in time).
It is, I think, an important and logical plateau for us to establish
on our climb into the future, for that reason.

Marc

Agreed.

We'd probably want to leave FORM method=GET behavior just the way it
is, and update method=POST.

Support on the server side is easy: CGI scripts accepting POSTs could
just start branching on the content-type, e.g., processing a new type
multipart/www-form.  A day's worth of hacking.

On the client side, generating multipart/www-form isn't much work
(factoring out the user interface complexity of supporting image
scribbles, etc.), but backwards-compatibility is a bear.  The only
way a server can declare format preferences in advance is through
anchors, really; so the only alternative I see is something like
a FORM method=POSTMP.

Dave, do you want to try this with your browser?  We'll support it
on the server side.

Well, I gather that html-mode.el is the most popular way to compose
HTML today. RTF2HTML, FM2HTML, LaTeX2HTML and that ilk are closing,
though.

My problem with all of these is that folks don't use an SGML parser to
validate their documents. Even the conversion tools generate invalid
stuff. To me, as long as the doc is valid, I don't care how you built
it.

I don't like the idea that HTML source goes right from somebody's
fingertips into a file, across the wire, and into a client browser
without ever being validated. This means client browsers have to deal
with a lot of noise. It means a lot of redundant processing. The
burden of generating valid HTML should be on the producer, not the
consumer.

>  => If so, and if he's right, then this changes the language

I don't mean to change the language design. HTML has always been a
language for the _transmission_ of hypertext. That people use text
editors to generate it is an artifact.

>Word here, or the SGMLs tools?

I'm not sure what you're asking here, but: (1) I think MS Word is a
viable platform for HTML development. If it's not, it soon will be.
(2) I see the SGMLs tools as _very_ widely available. It's a high
quality source distribution requiring an ANSI C compiler and almost
nothing else.


>2) including explicit DOCTYPE is a good idea.

It was a really bad idea to leave it out in the first place.

>to the anchor syntax.

Point taken. To get closure any time soon, we're going to have to
stick to strictly status quo.

[Fine comments about link maintenance deleted... we'll stick all that
in a spec AFTER we've got good mechanisms in place]

>4) There is a large demand from the user community for inline tables

>(I do not know how much demand there is for inline math)

I really made a bad choice of words with "inline." The <IMG> element
is great. What I don't want to see, yet, is stuff like:

	<image-gif notation="base64">232034o2ij2oi3j4o2i34j2o3i4</image-gif>
nor
	<eq notation="tex">e=m*c^2</eq> <!-- apologies to TeXperts -->

nor table markup in HTML -- yet.

>5) as for the claim that forms should be a separate DTD - I don't see
>the benefit.

I'm wary of making HTML to big for simple applications. Right now, for
example, an HTTP client is required to handle text/plain and
text/html. If we make forms part of text/html, then any HTTP client
that doesn't do forms is "broken." I don't think that's the way it
should be. I think forms should be an optional feature, and a client
should advertise support ala:

	Accept: image/gif
	Accept: application/html-form

and documents that use forms should be labelled as such, ala:

	<!DOCTYPE HTML-FORM PUBLIC "...">
	<title>...</title>
	<h1>My Form</h1>
	<form> ... </form>

I see all this as an argument that HTML-FORMS should be a differnt
document type from HTML.

Forms are newer and more unstable (though I gather a certain set of
elements is pretty stable...). I don't get the impression that anybody
has a good handle on a kernel of elements that span the entire space
of applications.

I'm leaning towards making the HTML-FORM document type a superset of
HTML, and including it as a sort of appendix to the spec.

OK, thanks for clarifying that!

By the way I wholeheartedly agree that some sort of multipart  
capability is sorely needed, especially to speed up interaction with  
forms that contain dynamic images.  But this is a wishlist issue, and  
should be deferred to HTML+. 


> [...on the topic of forms...]

Well, once you have "text" and "image" inputs, you can do almost  
anything.  (For examples of essentially arbitrary widgets built on  
top of the "image" input, take a look at our interactive gallery,  
"http://www.geom.umn.edu/apps/gallery.html".)

The two main limitations of "image" inputs are: (1) only a single  
point of user input can be captured, and (2) lack of multipart  
capability adds a network delay penalties, limiting the number you  
can use practically.  The first problem is already being addressed  
very nicely in HTML+ by Dave Raggett's "scribble" input.

Actually, the biggest issue in forms is not expressiveness -- since  
the ACTION script can effectively supply it once "text" and  
"scribble" widgets are available -- but client/server balancing of  
that expressive power.  Right now the client side, although a lot  
smarter than an X display, is still pretty dumb.  Fortunately, Dave  
Raggett is working on (still secret!) scripting capabilities for  
HTML+ forms to address this problem.

Exactly.  It's really important to be able to use arbitrary HTML  
inside a form -- forms just add interactive capabilities to HTML that  
have long been associated with hypermedia.

Although I think there is technical merit in Dan's suggestion to make  
"formness" an attribute of the whole document -- because multiple  
forms don't work anyway if you're trying to maintain state through  
hidden fields -- I don't see that we should be replacing features  
with less capable ones just to "protect the user".

Forms are out there, and already in their current state (X Mosaic  
2.2) provide some pretty powerful capabilities.  I say let's clamp  
that down into a base-level standard, so that experimentation into  
extensions (which is already happening) can have a solid foundation  
to build on.

There is already a way to define the encoding type.  There is an
attribute to the FORM tag called ENCTYPE that is supposed to 
specify the post content type.  Right now the only valid option
is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" but we can easily add
mime/multipart.

I'm not a real vi adict, but because it is so easy to write html directly
using any editor one is used to, I am very reluctant to learn some
editor just to do html (I'm using the zip/jot editor for sgi machines)

In my opinion the html I use is only because it is so simple. All of
the exhibits on EXPO were created this way (I don't know about
Barry's part though).

  Does anyone support the ENCTYPE attribute for forms yet?  Why not just
define a new ENCTYPE of multipart/www-form, and have the default still be
application/x-www-form-urlencoded?  It shouldn't take more than 20 minutes
to implement this on my browser.  How should multipart/www-form be defined?
Content-types for each input area?

Dan, I don't intend this as a flame, but you need to face reality, by
which I mean you need to look at what people ACTUALLY do, not what
you WISH they did.  As you observe, people don't use an SGML parser
to validate their documents.  There is no reason to think then that
they will ever start.  That's reality.  

> .. That people use text editors to generate it is an artifact.

Same thing.  If this is what people do NOW, what is the evidence
they will ever change?  Even if the SGMLs tools are easy to find,
and even if they were available pre-compiled binary for all major
platforms, I claim nobody will bother to get them unless they percieve
a benefit.

To summarize: People will continue to write in HTML without
the assistance of tools and validators.

If you want people to start using format HTML, I think you need
to show how this will provide real benefit TO THE AUTHOR, who
is the one who must do the work to install and use the checker.

HURRAH!  Praise the maker, another has come into the light.

This idea comes around every so often.  It is a good idea.  It 
is the correct thing to do.  I believe we should do it.

<SOAPBOX>
Having said that, I'd like to go on record as stating that I don't 
believe we ever WILL do it.

There is a feeling that anything which breaks current practice -- even 
though it is the correct and logical thing to do, even though it fixes 
something which has been broken since HTML was first created -- is BAD.

Would you like to see HTML (and what it can become) served out of every
cable box/information superhighway control widget in the country?  I
would.  I think it's strong enough.  I think it's the right choice. 

Let's build tools for the future - not tools shackled to the past.

This would be fine with me, and it would in fact be a WIN.  I had
to go to extra pain with my server to try and guess whether the client
supported forms or not.  I did this by looking at the User-Agent header,
and then I had to wire into my code knowledge about which release of Mosaic
and Lynx did and did not support forms.

Dan's suggestion would be a win.

Let me second that feeling and add a caution.  I favor standardization,
but I would argue for lenient interpretation by browsers, just the
same.  IMO, WWW hasn't exploded in use because it's based on SGML.  It
has done so because it's easy for people with a vanilla text editor to
write stuff easily, even stuff that is, strictly speaking, bogus.

There's probably no surer way to drive a stake through the growing use
of WWW than to put browsers on line that interpret HTML strictly, that
require users to write (absolutely) correct HTML, and that require folks
to use a special tool to create HTML.

Standardize wisely, implement forgivingly.

No, That's cinicism.

The vast majority of computer users don't even know what a text editor
is. They don't write programs: they use them. They know what MS Word
is. They use applications to capture their documents.

How about some 20 articles/week on comp.infosystems.www about RTF2HTML
tools?

I hope to see a day when it will be more valuable to spend time
validating a document with an SGML parser than testing it by hand with
different browser implementations, because the implementations will be
too numerous to make it feasible, but they will each conform to the
DTD. Call me a dreamer. :-}

As one who is currently buried in the user community--inline tables and
images are essential to what I want to do on the web. I also have converted
somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 technical papers to web-viewable format
for a workshop. They were heavily infested with math equations. I had to
take a screen capture of each one of them, and create a gif of it to be
used as an inline image. A *few* of the papers were prepared in LaTeX, and
I was able to get equations from those "for free" using the LaTeX to HTML
conversion program. (Thank you VERY MUCH!)

Whether it is separate or not--Please don't do away with forms! They are

Both sides are right, but you're talking about different groups of
people. Those who write HTML now will continue to do so. They are the
same people that prefer a text editor over a wordprocessor (I know,
I'm one of them). But many more people use WordPerfect, MS Word,
etc. and won't understand why they can't go on using it.

In the long run (say two or three years), more documents will be
generated with regular wordprocessors than with text editors. Most
authors will never see the SGML tags, just like they never see
Microsoft RTF or Postscript.

My advice: target HTML+ at SGML parsers, but keep it lightweight and
human-readable, because it seems neither Microsoft nor Wordperfect
really understand SGML yet. There will always be people that prefer to
work directly in HTML/HTML+ (just like there are people that prefer
Plain TeX to LaTeX...).

I don't think it's a dream at all. I predict it will be reality sooner

The problem is that we've been saying this for over a year now, and
I can't tell that it's any closer to reality now than it was then.

Yeah, but agreeing on that is the easy part :-).  What we keep having

The problem is the general problem of what an HTML browser should do if
it encounters an unrecognizable HTML tag. For example, if MacMosaic has put
in a warning 
"This document uses forms, a feature not currently supported by MacMosaic"

on top of every page that included <FORM>, I bet that you would see very
few build-in warnings. The same problem existed briefly with ISMAP feature
too. Instead of arguing about what should be part of HTML, it would be better
if there was a suggested mechanism about what a browser that does not
support a particular feature should do when it is encountered. Somewhat of a
Precedent is the <IMG> tag in lynx.

If application/html-form is defined, it would set a dangerous precedent of
trying to classify each major new feature into a separate document type.
A few years from now, a browser would be sending a request:

ACCEPT application/html-form
ACCEPT application/html-form-figure
ACCEPT application/html-figure
ACCEPT application/html-tables
ACCEPT application/html-form-custom-widget
ACCEPT application/html-form-custom-widget-live-socket-playback

If necessary, we can add an extra field to the HTTP request, that 
indicates how HTML savvy application is. This would also create a natural
compatibility hierarchy.

For those wishing to include images into multipart mime format, you will have
to define a system so that user's preferences are transmitted back to the
server, because many users do not want inline images because of the bandwidth.

A few thoughts on how will new MacMosaic handle the dreaded <P> tag:
Because it is impossible to make <P> a proper container in all the broken
documents out there, I have decided to treat <P> and </P> the same. They
both indicate a wish for whitespace. The difference between <P> and <BR> is
that <P> gives you more space, and multiple <P> are collapsed into 1. Also,
care is taken so that other surrounding tags such as <H*> do not conspire to
create vast regions of white space.

Since URL specs are at their final draft right now, I have hope that HTML will
eventually move in the same direction. The longer we wait, the harder it will
be to reconcile all the slightly different implementations.

What farsighted tag designers we have!  That's great we can just use
ENCTYPE.

Here's an example along that line:

--foo

lastname
Weber
--foo

firstname
Jay
--foo--

The overhead for this kind of encoding for n text fields is

  2 + (n+1)*(separator-size+3)  # for separator lines
+ n                             # leading newlines
+ n			 	# for post-fieldname newlines
+ 3                             # miscellaneous bytes

so even though it sounds like overkill this is fairly low-overhead as
long as separators are short.

Note that I've put field names as the first line of the text/plain data;
instead we could use the content-id header, e.g.

--foo
Content-id: lastname

Weber
--foo
Content-id: firstname

Jay
--foo

so it adds n*12 bytes of overhead but works much better with more interesting
types than text/plain.  (However, the MIME spec says that this are bogus
content-ids, which are supposed to me globally unique; I think that is silly
but I lost that battle some time ago.)

So do people think this overhead is too much, for simple text values?

Personally, I hope we can just learn from our problems on the URL
RFC, and move forward more briskly with HTML and HTTP. It may well be
that the first step in that process is an informational RFC (FYI) that
outlines current practice.

Part of moving forward more briskly in the URI group has been to try
to separate out the functional requirements from the specification.

I suggest we do that immediately after comprehensively documenting
existing practice.

Actually, I volunteered to Tim some months ago to do this for HTTP,
and Tim's response at the time was the same basic set of (forgive me,
Tim, but it's true) nonstarting ideas about distributed authorship and
small task forces and consortia-based coordination that didn't stick
when they were thrown against the wall way back last July in
Cambridge, and aren't sticking now -- and I didn't, and don't, just
want to try to take it away from him.

[more ranting and raving that Marc was going to put here about the
 need for documenting current practice elided to keep from boring
 people to death...]

So to get back to your question :-) -- I'm not currently volunteering
because I now have too many other things on my plate.

So, I think we currently need three people, one for each of HTML,
HTTP, and CGI, to step forward, codify existing practice as widely
implemented and used in (basically) Mosaic + Lynx + Bill Perry's Emacs
mode + CERN httpd + NCSA httpd + Plexus, and get the results out as
RFCs as soon as possible.

After this happens we can start working on the next generation of
these things on the basis of the firm plateau we will have reached.

I think it's safe to say that at this point we should definitely not
fold HTTP/HTML/etc. design into the IETF structure at least until
existing practice RFCs are out.

Hmm... Yes and No.  I, and most of the web maintainers at
Surrey, will use a client to check that links work, that we
remembered to put in </*> end delimiters (as they can be
seen by the effect they have on the document) and that
forms/imagemaps etc work.

Now, if clients were properly conformant (NB: I am not
using this as a technical term), and gave errors
and warnings (such as a missing </*> element, or something
unusual, like an <h2> after an <h1> but before an </h1>)
about the document it was parsing, then that would be
REALLY useful!

Well, if their client - the same one they would use to view
other people's documents - generated parse errors, then I
reckon you'd find that most people DID use it, as they
would have used it to check other parts of the document
anyway.  Of course, the client should still try and display
as best it can the information represented in the document,
so that if another person's doc has errors, you don't have
to wait for them to fix them before you can see the
document.

People already ARE checking their documents to some
extenet, but this is limited to what their client can do. 
Lets make sure the clients report parse errors/warnings. 

And to do that we need a decent standard ;o)

Does this mean that we can then have conditional html that
only provides certain features if the client supports them?

I mean like the imagemap thing and the "click
<a href...>here</a> if you can't see the pretty picture to
click on" syndrome.  In my view, an alternate way of
communicating information if the desired method is
unavailable should ONLY be seen WHEN the desired method is
unavailable.

Subject: CERN 2.17beta fix & IdentityCheck
content-length: 942


I was stupid enough to forget one unconditional DEBUG message to
2.17beta distribution.  This doesn't cause any problems if running
standalone, but from inetd it appends this message to each document.
I compiled fresh binaries for inetd people, and replaced the source
tar packet with a new one.

Another, more important thing: it has been brought to my attention
that many OS'es have a kernel bug that causes all connections to
remote hosts to be cut if remote identd is not responding.  Therefore,
if your server host OS has this bug DO NOT USE IdentityCheck.

SunOS 4.1.1, NeXT 2.0a, ISC 3.0 with TCP 1.3, AIX 3.2.2 have the bug,
later ok.  Sony News/OS 4.51, HP-UX 8-something, Ultrix 4.3 still
have the bug.  Fix for Ultrix is available (CXO-8919).

Thanks to Per-Steinar Iversen for this information.

If I'm permitted to take myself as an example:

I routinely test all my HTML pages with sgmls. In fact, many of them
are generated (i.e. translated) by sgmls, because I don't like HTML
and am writing in HTML+ or my own local adaptation of HTML most of the
time.

It's not only to deal with the variety of browsers out there, but also
because I like to make hardcopy of what I write. I do that by having
sgmls (& sgmlsasp) translate HTML to LaTeX. To make that work, the
document must be fully and correctly tagged.

I even maintain some Unix manual pages in HTML, using sgmls to
generate the nroff markup.

I agree that installing sgmls is not an option for most people, except
the few that know enough about SGML. But the suggestion by somebody
that browsers do not ignore markup errors, but report them (in a
friendly way, of course), could be an alternative. In my "vision" of
the future many, if not most documents will be multi-purpose, and that
means that people will simply have to write (correct) SGML.

I second that.. incorrect HTML is a big problem when you want to use
a native HTML editor, since it has to parse it and convert it into
something that makes sense. Methinks that most people are not even
aware of the fact that they write incorrect HTML - they use a browser
like Mosaic to "validate" their documents, and if they look ok, they
assume that the HTML is correct. Which is not the case. :-(

Of course, when using a browser to access information on the web, nobody
wants to see tons of error messages, but something like an optional
"show HTML parse error messages" would be of great help for HTML authors,
especially the newbies.

Cheers,
Chris

This is sort of in follow up to Bert's email about using sgmls to verify
HTML/HTML+, which I deleted earlier today, and now wish I hadnt since it
probably had the answer to what I wanted... but anyway here goes. 

Okay, I did a bit of digging with Archie just now and pulled down
(*drum*roll*) sgmls and then grabbed the htmlplus.dtd.txt from Dave
Raggett's FTP site (the one dated 5th April 1994). So I plugged the two
together and issued the command:

	sgmls ~/sgmls/DTD/htmlplus.dtd.txt ~/public_html/test.html

Anyway after deleting the lines in the DTD (around lines number 296 to
310) that deal with the character sets, I am still down to one or three
errors that I cant seem to place. So here they are. First of all the
HTML that I am using. Note that it isnt a full document and only just a
few lines:

			======test.html======
<HTMLPLUS>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>
This is a HTML+ test file!
</TITLE>
<ISINDEX>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>
This is some text
</H1>
</BODY>
</HTMLPLUS>
			======test.html======

So when I run this through sgmls using the above command I get:

			========output=======
AVERSION IMPLIED
ACHARSET IMPLIED
(HTMLPLUS
(HEAD
AID IMPLIED
ACHARSET IMPLIED
(TITLE
-tkWWW guide at Brunel ... or yet another fine mess!
)TITLE
)HEAD
(BODY
)BODY
sgmls: SGML error at /user/ccsr/ccsrpsw/public_html/test.html, line 7 at
">":
       Out-of-context H1 start-tag ended HTMLPLUS document element (and
parse)
)HTMLPLUS
			========output=======

Assuming that all the AVERSION, ACHARSET, AID implied stuff is okay
(ideas?) why does sgmls refuse to parse the <H1> tag? (or any tag in the
body to be exact, I tried <EM B>, <BR>, etc). Failing that I even tried
just

<BODY>
this is some text
</BODY>

instead of the bit inside the <BODY></BODY> tags above, and it barfed
on that... and from how I read the DTD plain text (#PCDATA) is a valid
content of a pair of <BODY> tags...

So where am I going wrong? 

Thanks in advance etc etc :)

Hello Paul (and others),

Setting up sgmls isn't easy, as you noticed. Especially when an SGML
declaration references an external file (as for the character
entities), you have to do quite a lot of work. (Btw. the character
entities can be found e.g., on ifi.uio.no)

The error with the <H1> tag is easily explained: before the <H1> tag
there must be a <DIV1> tag.

When designing the HTML+ DTD, Dave Raggett had to make a compromise:
on the one hand, we wanted to be able to mark "sections" of a
document, because it is expected that HTML document will be used more
and more in conjunction with other SGML tools, for example to retrieve
*parts* of document; on the other hand there was the restriction in
SGML, that in that case the start tag <DIV1>, could not be
omitted. (For some technical reasons, which I wouldn't like to explain
here.)

There is a comment to that effect in the DTD:

<!--
  Browsers *must* tolerate missing DIVn tags, e.g. the presence of an
  <H1> tag implies a DIV1 element enclosing it and the following text.
  The SGML standard unfortunately doesn't permit such inferences due
  to a decision made to simplify writing general SGML parsers.
-->

So, browsers are encouraged to gracefully handle the missing tags, but
sgmls simply checks according to the SGML standard, and therefore
produces an error message.

It is not that much extra work to put in the <DIV1> tags. And it will
only be temporary. There are commercial SGML wordprocessors that will
handle this automatically, but unfortunately, they are rather
expensive.

Btw. if you are only testing, you can call sgmls with the -s option.
Otherwise you will get the parser's output on your screen, which is
not very human-friendly (but very useful when piping the output to a
script).

You need to look at the DTD in greater detail, as you have left out the
DIV1 element which is expected around the H1 header, e.g.

    <DIV1>
        <H1>This is some text</H1>
    </DIV1>

Remember that the DTD is intended for use with SGML authoring tools or
document conversion tools. HTML+ browsers on the other hand have no
difficulty in automatically inferring missing DIVn elements as they
need to handle legacy documents correctly. So *DON'T* worry, if you
want to continue typing HTML into a good old text editor, you won't be
forced into typing in all these funny elements as the browser can figure
them out for itself. My HTML+ browser does all this and will be on show
at WWW'94.

> Assuming that all the AVERSION, ACHARSET, AID implied stuff is okay

This is how sgmls reports on #IMPLIED attributes when they are missing.

> <BODY>this is some text</BODY>

This is miles off! The DTD expects you to supply a document HEAD and
then to include the text within a suitable container. Try instead:

    <HEAD>
    <BODY>
      <PROLOGUE>
        <P>this is some text

The PROLOGUE and EPILOGUE elements are used for stuff without headers
which you want at the start or end of the document respectively. If the
text starts with a header then use the corresponding DIVn element instead.
Note that an HTML+ browser will work ok with just:

     "this is some text"

by using the DTD to guide error recovery.

Best wishes,

Absolutely.  In the real world, there will be a variety of uses of
documents, and a variety of humans writing HTML in a variety of ways.
Many authors will probably start with existing HTML documents as templates.
Their most familiar tool will be their Web browser of choice. It is
unrealistic to expect hundreds of thousands (or millions) of document
authors to  install and learn an SGML tool.

If we assume that most users of the Web are readers, not authors, then
it may make sense for browsers to do the best they can with bad HTML,
and not issue error messages.  But that just says the default should
be that behavior; there's no reason why there couldn't be an option
that turns on error reporting.

Subject: Re: FORM ENCTYPE=multipart/www-form  (was: Toward closure on HTML)
content-length: 1337


I got a response that said separate MIME parts per form entry was too
much overhead for text values, while not just use SGML?

The reason we are discussing the use of MIME is because we see form
values soon extending to relatively complex media clips (signatures,
files, snapshots, etc. -- some already supported by ViolaWWW, by
the way).  SGML is not suitable for that but MIME is.

So if the multipart/www-form overhead for simple fields is too much,
we need some hybrid.  Here's a suggestion:

 each part in a multipart/www-form is interpreted as a form field
 whose name appears in the Content-id, and value is the part's body
 of type specified by an optional Content-type UNLESS the content-type
 is an ENCTYPE other than multipart/www-form, which is interpreted as
 containing additional form name/value pairs.

E.g.,

COntent-type: multipart/www-form


--foo
Content-type: application/www-form-url-encoded

line1=val1&line2=val2&line3=val3
--foo
Content-id: comments

This is supposed to be some long block of text,
e.g. from a TEXTAREA or file inclusion

--foo
Content-id: sig
Content-type: image/xpm

<lots of bits here>
--foo--


(I said that "catch-all" parts should be an ENCTYPE *other than
multipart/www-form* to reserve the use of recursive multipart/www-forms
for hierarchical forms with hiearchical name spaces.)

  But who decides when something should be moved from the
application/www-form-url-encoded block to a block of its own?  Simply
saying 'only textarea, scribble, audio, and image/*' might not be 100%
accurate.  What happens when there is a very long 'text' block?  It is
conceivable if someone doesn't put a MAXLENGTH into an <input type=text>
that someone could type in 10000 characters (I believe that was the default
Maxlength attribute).

  I just want to get this straight before I implement it. :)

Jay,

My thoughts on a multipart/related format for forms are to start with
an SGML based encoding for most fields and to use additional parts
as needed for data which doesn't fit neatly into the SGML scheme, e.g.
audio, pen input (as JOT), and file data. This way you normally just
see one part.

The next step is to define the SGML DTD for form contents and to
specify the naming scheme for referencing data in other parts.
The SGML ID notation springs to mind here.

That choice can be made entirely by the client, which could get arbitrarily
sophisticated, but I suspect it will end up being a matter of programming
convenience.  In that case, I think all <input type=text> fields will end
up in catch-all blocks.  Won't matter much to servers, it's just a minor
change of overhead.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that if someone wants to invent another
ENCTYPE, say text/sgml-www-form, then you can just use that as the
catch-all content-type instead of application/www-form-url-encoded.

But I guess the strong version of your thoughts is to require this new
SGML-based simple form value type, and bury www-form-url-encoded in
history.

I'm sure there are others who'll say "sure that would have been more
elegant, but why invent a new simple form format at this point?"

For my part, I like having the MIME encapsulation support either, then
we'll see what happens when the developers have at it.

If this was a small project just starting out, that would be a valid suggestion 
(but a poor one; a paragraph should hava a tag just like anything else). 

Given however that the Web is in daily use by millions, such a suggestion is 
well off the mark.

Yes, there is a problem in that <p> has no </p> and is at the end of a 
paragraph. OK, its broken but the browsers handle it.

They also handle a form which fits in with the way all the other tags work:

<p>this is a paragraph.</p>

and this form is likely to be in html+

Absolutely.

This is confusing several issues. Yes, HTML should be frozen as a standard 
rather than continually being twiddled with. Hence HTML+; what was learned from 
HTML has been fed into it. 

But altering HTML at this late stage to be even less SGML compliant would be 
such a bad move I am amazed that anyone has suggested it.

Incompatibility is a non-issue; I suspect a browser can tell the difference 
between text/html and text/htmlplus.

Now is indeed the time to consider such changes; the defect has been noted and 
corrected; the HTML+ DTD specifies <p> ... </p>. Simple, consitent, SGML 
compliant. End of problem.

Indeed.

Why?

And why just lists?

And why LaTeX of all the awful things to pick as an example. If you are happy 
writing in LaTeX, do that - and use the Leeds converter to make it into HTML. 
But do not suggest that HTML be altered in wierd and un-SGML-like ways to fit in 
with what you happen to already find familiar. Not everyone uses LaTeX; and as 
the Web grows outside the research/academic community, the percentage of LaTeX 
users will fall drastically.

>Third, the mechanism for expressing this in SGML, SHORTREF, introduces

><em/foo/ and other tricky parsing idioms.

I think this is just saying that the suggested "empty line means a closing 
paragraph tag really" method is just not SGML and would need unsightly hacks to 
express in in a DTD. I agree.

>In other words, you would rather have a language that is convenient
>to parse than one that is convenient to use. Big mistake. 

You think that having a blank line mean something in one place and not mean it 
in other places (lists, whrere else) is 'convenient to use'. Come to that, you 
think that anything connected with LaTeX is convenient to use? An even bigger 
mistake.

Count the number of people using LaTeX in 'the real world' compared to the 
number using GUI wordprocessors.

>The 
><p> ... </p> construct is a big step in the wrong direction: it makes

No, it makes it something which is consistent with the way all the other tags 
work and is therefore easier to use and understand if you are typing in html by 
hand - which is not the only way to do it. How 'onerous' is typing </P> ??

You will be suggesting next that titles are well handled by a text editor

This is a title
---------------

so that should be in HTML too? ;-)

>no one but a parser-writer
>would view <p> ... </p> as an elegant way to say "this is a

So you want to do away with <li> too? How does LaTeX do that then?
If people understand that <h1>Title</h1> is a title, understanding that 
<p>paragraph</p> is a paragraph does not seem too great a leap.

I think this thread has conflated several distinct points:

1) Current usage

Current use of the <p> tag as a separator is anomalous. This has been sorted in 
HTML+

2) Ease of parsing

Having a consistent, SGML compliant syntax makes documents easy to parse and 
generate automatically; altering the spec to allow non-SGML-like forms would be 
a backward step.

3) Ease of use

People find easiest using what they know already. People used to LaTeX naturally 
find the forms of that mark-up more natural. People using other things will find 
those things more natural. The solution to this is not however to turn HTML into 
LaTeX - which which would only suit one subgroup of users - but to author using 
a system you are familiar with and convert or export as HTML. Solutions already 
exist for LaTeX, FrameMaker, Microsoft Word and WordPerfect. There is a project 
to develop a Motif GUI html editor. Ease of use is addressed by better 
HTML-producing tools, not by convenience hacks to HTML.

I agree that rolling them into one transaction is desirable. I do not see that 
this needs anything radically different, however.

One situation where this was brought forcibly home to me was a project 
experimenting with electronic journals. One section of one paper can have 50 - 
200 inline images. Why? because it is a materials science journal, and each 
single  occurence of a alpha or whatever is a separate, small image. (Currently 
an XBM; soon to be a 64 greyscale GIF with a transparent colour, i hope).

I notice that much of the time the delay is in establishing a connection, ie 
latency rather than transfer rate. So bringing the whole lot over as one chunk 
would be a *lot* faster.

Now, the brower knows whether inline images are switched off or not. So it knows 
that if a document has inline images, it is going to get them. All. One at a 
time.

The problem is that the accept: types are being ignored, I think.

When a user switches off inline images, the browser should adjust its list of 
accepted MIME types to not include any image types. 

Browsers should accept (and be able to handle) MIME multipart messages.

Servers should take notice of the accept types in a request, and do something 
sensible with them.

So what I propose is: (and no I don't remember the exact syntax - sorry)

Case 1: client has inline images ON and supports multipart messages, server is 
multipart aware

GET blah.html ACCEPT (various image types, others) multipart/mixed

Server bundles up blah.html and all its inline images as a MIME multipart, ships 
it all over the net in one go, client unpacks it and does the right things with 
the bits.

Case 2: client has inline images OFF and supports multipart messages, server is 
multipart aware

GET blah.html ACCEPT (no image types, others) multipart/mixed

Server sends blah.html as current situation

Case 3: client has inline images ON and supports multipart messages, server is 
multipart dumb.

GET blah.html ACCEPT (various image types, others) multipart/mixed

Server sends blah.html as current situation, client realises it does not have 
the inline images so it gets them, one by one, as curent situation.

Case 4: client has inline images ON and does not support multipart messages,  
server is multipart aware

GET blah.html ACCEPT (various image types, others)

Server sees client does not accept multipart, just sends blah.html as current 
situation.

The only drawback I see is that some processing is needed on the server side; 
either pre-generation of a convenient list of inline images or parsing of the 
html files before sending them when the incoming GET accepts multipart/mixed.

Perhaps this could be done incrementaly. The server looks for some file - 
.blah.html, or something - and if it is not there, parses the html file to find 
what images need to be bundled up. After it has sent the multipart it writes 
.blah.html to save time next time.

So: what I have suggested would give a performance improvement, would require no 
changes to existing or future html documents and would simply require browsers 
to adjust their accept types appropriately and servers to take some notice of 
them. I think it would fit the current HTTP spec or be a trivial and logical 
extension of it conformant with current MIME practice. Code to implement client 
side splitting of multipart messages is already available such as the mm stuff 
from bellcore (would that be useable?). Existing browsers and existing servers 
would not be affected.

If anyone sees something I have overlooked, I would be glad if they would point 
it out.

  What if the server already happens to have some of the images cached?
It seems like a waste to be constantly retransmitting the images.

  Presumably with links of some sort, so that the images could be
fetched later. (heh.  Using 'message/external-body' as a base, define
content-type 'image/external-body'... :-)

  I still think that the current scheme of embedding URL's to images in
lieu of the images is a good one.  Granted, the need to reconnect for
every image is annoying; it would be "nice" to be able to send multiple
requests per connection to servers that didn't immediately close down...

True. But transmitting to the server what images it has cached incas eany of 
those are in the current document seems too big an o verhead. As I said, from 
the users point of view the delay is in establishing each connectiuon. 
Retransmitting inline images seems better, IMHO I agree this is a flaw with the 
suggested method, though.

Of course ... as I said, blah.html is transmitted as the current situation, so 
the links are still in there. Presumably the browser wouls put small icons for 
delayed image in those places where the inline images were not in the browser 
cache, as at present.

>   I still think that the current scheme of embedding URL's to images in
> lieu of the images is a good one.

I agree, and did not suggest otherwise in my original post. The idea is not to 
remove the URLs or change the html in any way, but to predict that the browser 
will ask for a bunch of inline images shortly, and send them all in a bunch.

> Granted, the need to reconnect for

Well that is the other way of doing it, and would also account for cached 
images. Let the *browser* do the parsing, as at present; build up a list of 
inline images not in the cache, then send this as a list of GETs in one request. 
This would need more changes to the HTTP spec, though, I suspect.

Subject: Come 'n Get it: A DTD for current practice in HTML
Date: Wed, 06 Apr 1994 21:28:53 -0500
From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 5611


Ok. I did it. I grabbed a bunch of HTML files from all over creation
(NCSA, CERN, Leeds, U Hawaii, etc.), and ran them all through sgmls
with the same DTD. The results are pretty raw, but the DTD
is at:

http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-test/html.dtd

and the whole shootin match is at:

http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-test/

I had to tweak the docs a little, but mostly, when in doubt, I tweaked
the DTD. I did find quite a few "coding errors" (i.e. missing or extra
</a> tags, HREF spelled HERF).

I'd like to take the diffs from the draft-iiir-html-01.txt version
of the DTD and enumerate them, but I pretty much rewrote the DTD,
so diff won't tell me much.

But from memory:

* I changed OMITTAG to YES in the <!SGML declaration, and tweaked
the DTD to take advantage of it. This means that

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "...">
	<TITLE>title</TITLE>
	<H1>header</H1>
	...

parses the same as

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "...">
	<HEAD><TITLE>title</TITLE></HEAD>
	<BODY><H1>header</H1>
	...
	</BODY>

which is pretty much current practice anyway.

* I also changed LI, DT, and DD from EMPTY to being containers with
omitted end tags. I think this is the way people see it.

* But I left <P> as EMPTY. The problem is not just changing all the
markup that's out there, but changing the tutorials, conversion tools,
etc. Soon, I'd like to change <P> to being a container, but not until
the folks that write tutorials and converters sign up to support the
change. And even then, perhaps a better strategy would be to introduce
a new element name <PP>..</PP> and retire <P> altogether. It's bad to
change the meaning of a widely-bound symbol.

* I changed SHORTTAG to YES to support
	<DL COMPACT> and <OPTION SELECTED>
as short forms form
	<DL STYLE="COMPACT"> and <OPTION STATE="SELECTED">
This opens up all sorts of tricky SGML parsing snafus in theory, but
in practice nobody does stuff like <em/this/. Yet.

* I added forms as per

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html

All 13 example documents are valid. (except for a missing </FORM> in one of
them...) I also checked a couple random forms from other places.

* The content model for BODY is ANY. Technically, this means you
could put TITLE, LINK, BASE, and ISINDEX tags in the body even though
they're only supposed to go in the HEAD. But I got lazy...

* I added a FIG element, cuz I got grossed out when folks used PRE
to attach captions to images.

* Most elements are allowed anywhere:
	- The basic "tag soup" level is called %htext;
	It consists of #PCDATA, plus %inline (EM, STRONG, ...)
	plus %fonts (B, I, TT, ...) plus A, P, and BR.

	All these can be nested except A.

	- A can contain anything (ANY content mode), like headers, lists, etc.

	- The structured elements are called %block,
	i.e. DL, UL, OL, PRE, BLOCKQUOTE, FORM...
	Most of these can be nested, but FORM can't contain another FORM.

	- Headers can only occur inside BODY (or inside A).


Here are the idioms I saw on my journey that I'd like to ban ASAP,
since they'll never work with SGML tools:

	* Big long unquoted attribute values, like
		<A HREF=http://foo/bar/baz.html>
	The LaTeX2HTML converter is particularly bad about this.

	* Anchor names that don't work as IDs, e.g. <A NAME=1> or
	<A NAME="my_name">. If we make the anchor name an SGML ID,
	the SGML parser can validate uniqueness.

	* <SELECT SIZE=12,3>. Use <SELECT SIZE="12 3"> and
	an SGML parser can validate that the SIZE attribute is
	a list of numbers. Gotta use ""'s in any case.

Here are some that just gross me out:

	* Use of %font (<B> and <I>) outside of PRE. If folks
	don't have enough info to choose between EM, CITE, STRONG,
	etc., just use <EM> for italics and <STRONG> for bold.

	* Use of %inline (EM, CITE, STRONG) inside PRE. It doesn't
	make sense to me.
	
	* <IMG> inside <PRE> to attach captions to images.

	* Using <DL><DD>...<DD>..</DL> in stead of <UL>...</UL>
	just cuz it looks better.


So... now.. what's next? If folks are interested in what I've got
(that is: interested enough to test out the DTD on their stuff, use it
to guide experimentation, stuff like that) then I'm willing to add
some comments and write up what I've got from a technical point of view.

Then, In order to publish this DTD, we need a human-readable document
to accompany it. The CERN spec is pretty bulky, and it would need
quite a bit of editing to get all the new features and old crufties
out.

By the way... is anybody interested in various "levels of
conformance"? The CERN spec categorizes stuff as "Mainstream" or
"Extra". If we're going to standardize that stuff, we need
corresponding versions of the DTD so that we can ask an SGML parser
"Did I use any non-Mainstream features?" i.e. "Will this document be
presented without loss of information on all minimally-conforming
implementations?"

Anyway... What I've created here matches NCSA Mosaic for X version 2.2
pretty well. I'd be willing to attach NCSA's "A Beginner's Guide to
HTML" (aka
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html) and
submit it as an informational RFC. Or if the NCSA pubs folks would
like to write an HTML reference, I'm sure that would go over well.

Then, after that... is anybody out there interested in making HTML a
little more useful as an SGML document type? e.g. make <P> a
container, use the ID/IDREF feature here and there... use processing
instructions in stead of <BR> tags... stuff like that so that
we could start building tools to take advantage of strucutre
(outlining tools, automated ways to combine documents for printing and
such...).

I'm surprised to read this.  I've been reading and writing HTML for quite
some time now and was never aware of this distinction.  Is this pie in
the sky or just poorly documented.

Actually, it hasn't always been like that. I changed it for 1.1. It's
different again in 1.2, it's a new indexing format that we agreed on with
CERN which uses PRE instead of lists.

Accept types aren't a general answer, which is (I think) why they're
being generally ignored.  See below.

No, because I may want to download an external GIF if that's all
that's on the other end of the link, but I also may not want an HTML
document (if *that's* what's on the other end of the link) to have
inlined GIF images.  What do I then put in the Accept line?

I don't think the Accept thing was sufficiently thought through.  I
think there has to be some notion of context -- e.g., I accept these
formats as inlined images; I accept these formats as external images
and other media types; I may accept these formats (if only just to
save to local disk and view on another system somewhere else later)
but prompt me before you go ahead and download the data so I can
decide on a case-by-case basis.

> Browsers should accept (and be able to handle) MIME multipart

Agreed.

(I will however point out that HUNDREDS of people have said this in
the past, and yet no one has implemented it.  Classic problem, hm?)

Dave,

Instead of teasing us for months on end, why not just release some
alpha binaries?

I agree Marc !

Please Dave, think many authors on the web still make their HTML+ documents
nearly by hand that is with inappropriate text editors !

The browsers are not a solution : that are not their jobs ! We will be happy
to look at your editor at WWW'94 but why not testing it before even with
an alpha version ?

Cheers,

Didier

*whew*  I get my mail in batches at the beginning of the following day, so
I've had to read this whole thread in one big swallow.  But I digress...

There have been good points made all around, but by the end I forgot what
the original poster had to say.  After reading all these messages I became
somewhat confused about the present future (ahem) of HTML/HTML+.  I had
been under the impression that Dave Raggets HTML+ was to become the next
great thing, and that the preliminary official draft (I'm striving for
ambiguosity here...) is imminent.  If that is not the case, shouldn't it
be?  It appears that he has put a huge amount of work into it and, from
what I can gather, has a working DTD to boot.  What more can we ask of a
spec?

Does the question now need to be asked "So, where exactly are we"?  Is
Raggets HTML+ the next standard or is the gist of this thread we need to
back up to square one and standardize on what we got?  I say, let HTML be
the defacto but work as quickly as possible to solidify HTML+.  Muck and
mire are starting to form as too many people want to go too many
directions.

Isn't all this just remarkable?  I've been following this newsgroup for
perhaps nine months or so and been facinated to watch the web grow
unmercifully.  Everyone should be applauded for what has happened up to
this point, but beware the 'design by committee', which this mailing list
is trying to become (as opposed to 'design by community', which is how I
view the process to this point)

Mailer: Elm [revision: 70.85]
content-length: 886

I would like to clear up a confusion that people seem to be
having on paragraphs in html+.

This is correct:

        <p>this is a paragraph.</p>

But so is:

        <p>this is a paragraph.
        <p>and this is another one
        <p>and so is this
        
SGML allows you to omit end tags when specified by the document type
definition, as parsers can easily infer the end of the element. In this
case the next <P> tag implies the end of the previous paragraph.

***** THERE IS NO NEED TO WRITE THE </P>

Browsers can go beyond the SGML standard and infer missing start tags
as well, so the following illegal piece of html+

        <h1>A header</h1>
        followed by a paragraph.

Gets interpreted by the browser as:

        <h1>A header</h1>
        <p>followed by a paragraph.

Use <BR> to insert blank lines when you don't want to terminate the paragraph.

Ah, we have a misunderstanding. Sorry if I was not clear before.

What I meant was that the browser should clear image types from its accept field 
when requesting an html file, when inline images are switched off. It should 
certainly have them in the accept field when it is following a link to an 
external image. The browser can tell the difference by parsing the link.

In other words, I was suggesting that the browser adjust the accept fields 
to be relevant to the current request.

>I don't think the Accept thing was sufficiently thought through.  I
>think there has to be some notion of context

Agreed. Now that I have explained myself better, do you agree that the 
case-by-case twiddling of the accept fields provides this notion of context - at 
least, in the case I was discussing?


> -- e.g., I accept these
>formats as inlined images; I accept these formats as external images

My proposal covered these two cases

Fine, and I did not consider these as they were outside the context of what i 
was discussing (removing latency caused by multiple gets of inline images).>

Possibly because there was no particularly good reason to do so before? If 
implementing multipart is seen to produce tangible performance benefits, rather 
than simply being one of those nice things to have for completeness, people will 
be motivated to support it.

I would think that implementation would be greatly aided by existing code for 
MIME mailers. There is already code to parcel up multiparts and to split them up 
again. HTTP being 8 bit clean there is no need to mess around with base64 
encodings and such. It is just a case of a few headers and separators.

Dan,
  Thanks for the work...   I have been following this whole thread
and wondering what was going to become of HTML.
  I cut my HTML teeth by using the above primer and was doing very well
at it.  That is, until I joined this fine group ;-)
  No one ever told me that I should "validate" my documents with
some SGML validator.  We must remember that the people on this list
constitute the elite of WWW and HTML.  Expecting all HTML authors
to now go out and gather these tools AND make them write conforming
*SGML* documents seems unrealistic.

  If you are going to place added "requirements" on people, please:
	- bundle all of the tools together (sgmls, the dtd, etc)
	- provide binaries (i.e. like X Mosaic)
	- update the primers
	- provide lots of examples of conforming documents
	and finally...
	- place them in a well known place

Remember, until *affordable* tools are available, we pretty much have
to write our documents by hand.

Thanks
pel

@ Yes...  Pretty please.  We can't all travel to WWW'94 and to wait until
@ the end of May is pure torture!

Hrm, just thinking aloud here (and adding my voice to the call for a
prerelease since I took a look at the .gif file and it looks dead
nifty)....

Since you have the HTML spec fully implemented Dave, and you say it
validates HTML etc why not release. After all:

a) the end of May is a long way off in WWW terms. We may be on HTML+++
then ( :) for the humoursly impared :) )

b) Since we all want HTML+ to evolve now that HTML is being ``officially''
laid down, we do need some sort of full HTML browser?

c) If you have something that good, why hold it back - and if you dont
know what I mean check out the screen shot :)

But seriously Dave, please please please do atleast a statically
compiled binary prerelease in the next few days... we all want to know
what we can expect in the future... cos it sure looks good...

Paul

With all due respect to Mr. Ragett and his efforts...

HTML+, as I see it, lacks the following:
	* Support from CERN (they write that HTML+ will _not_ replace HTML)
	* Support from NCSA (they have implemented some features, but
	not the bulk of them)
	* Widespread use, which follows from a lack of...
	* An available implementation

As a spec, it's also somewhat more prescriptive ("here's how we should
do it...") than descriptive ("here's what folks do that's useful...").

The DTD is also apparently not an exact description of HTML+. An HTML+
implementation is supposed to be able to do more tag inference than a
standard SGML parser. I have yet to see a formal description of the
exact set of inferences required of an HTML+ implementation.

The majority reaction seems to favor standardizing on what we got.

Too many folks aren't happy with a defacto standard. They want

I don't see the distinction. I have made my ideas widely available.
There is no committee. Whatever happens at this point is a product of
sheer momentum.

I suggest that even though this is doable, it is not consistent with
current practice -- and I'm not talking about technical matters here.
Much of the HTML documentation (NCSA's primer, CERN doc, etc.) says
that <P> is a paragraph separator, not a paragraph container. I think
this is the way 95% of the HTML authors see it in their heads.

I suggest HTML+ use a new name for this paragraph container element,
say PP. When folks mean paragraph separator, they can write <P>. When
they mean container, they can write <PP>.

We should introduce this element into HTML also. I think it's a
trivial change to Mosaic, lynx, etc. to introduce support for a PP
element.

It's a bad thing to have the same name mean two different things in
HTML and HTML+.

Is there a formal description of exactly what errors are handled by an
HTML+ implementation?

I'm hoping folks will validate their documents. I can't require it.

What I'm looking for is some formal description of a document format
that I can implement and productize with a certain level of confidence
that I will be supporting most of the stuff out there on the web.

If this DTD (plus some minor tweaks and cleanup based on feedback) is
published, we will have something so that implementors and authors can
check their work if they so desire.

Good idea. I may or may not have resources to do this. I hope that
places like CERN and NCSA will help out with this part.

Yes... it is the task of "the elite of WWW and HTML" to provide
affordable tools to promote the mechanisms and standards we publish.

Dan,

You are missing the point. My scheme means that people who are
used to thinking of <P> as a paragraph separator (or terminator
as the NCSA docs put it) can go on doing so. HTML+ browsers will
happily deal correctly with such usage. There is NO NEED to
introduce a new element.

More sophistocated information providers will take advantage
of the range of features in HTML+ and will be happy too. The
DTD has been carefully crafted with the help of SGML experts
with the use of document conversion tools and SGML authoring
tools in mind. People can continue to author documents using
simple text editors if they prefer, and the DTD provides a
means of cleaning up the lack of formality in hand entered
documents.

I intend to use my parser as the basis for a lint/beatify
program as soon as I can get some time free. Perhaps you
would like to take a crack at this too. Actions will speak
much louder than words, here for the vast majority of the web.

As for error recovery. The content model is fully exploited
to infer missing tags. Where this is insufficient, I have
provided additional comments in the DTD.

Best wishes,

Dave Raggett

I don't believe so. I believe I have examined the point closely for quite
some time, and I just plain disagree with it.

But what the NCSA docs say and what the HTML+ browser does are
different things. Hence the new element. I'd be happy to see an HTML+
browser see:

	<h1>heading</h1>
	Para 1<p>
	Para 2

and infer:

	<h1>heading</h1>
	<pp>Para 1<p></pp>
	<pp>Para 2</pp>

but to infer:

	<h1>heading</h1>
	<p>Para 1</p>
	<p>Para 2</p>

is a bad idea, if you ask me.

All this is still possible when the paragraph element is called PP.

The DTD provides no such thing. The HTML+ extensions to SGML may.

I remain unconvinced that those comments constitute a formal
definition of HTML+. But I'm not interested enough to construct a
counter-argument. Mostly, I just think it's silly to say that HTML+ is
"just like SGML except..."

I cut my HTML teeth using vi and CERN's httpd and linemode browser obtained 
from CD-ROM.  My latest HTML was written with the Word for Windows GT_HTML, 
which is how I plan for my customers to be writing HTML (WinWord being TCE's 
official word processor).  Automatic tools for validating (and fixing!) HTML 
are the way to go, but they need to be easy enough to use as well as obtain 
so that everyone can write HTML.  Anyone interested in writing an HTML 
validator AND fixer?  My hands are full overcoming the lack of the upcoming 
"submit file" HTML form widget...

    I would hope that an HTML editor would be put *inside* the viewer.  It's
the most logical place for one as far as I can tell.  The server changes would
require support for the POST method (with appropriate security features 
implemented of course).

Dave, that may be correct in principle, but in real life it opens a 
rather nasty can of worms.  (Re: <p>Text -- infering or assuming  the 
missing </p> endtag)

When we get to a point where we support stylesheets (PLEASE!) it is of 
extreme importance to consider <p></p> a container.  Without this, it is 
not possible to assign stylistic attributes to a contained element.

Current practice suggests that <p> is not a container at all, it is a
logical break -- or it is considered as a container with no contents.  This
is the behavior of available browsers, as I understand them.

---------------------Example---------------------
<body>
This is text with no container. (1)
<p>
Perhaps this is text in a <p> container. (2)
<p>
Hmmm... no </p> associated with the previous <p>!  Do we assume that there 
was to be one, or do we treat <p> as a break? (3)
</body>
-------------------------------------------------

The principles behind SGML -- and by its lineage, HTML -- are to markup 
the structure of the document.  

In the previous example, what is the text associated with (1)?  It is
<body> text or <p> text?  And if we build stylesheets which allow logical
elements within the document to have their own stylistic "hints", which do
we apply to (1)? 

Inquiring minds want to know.

While this is true today, I don't think that it makes any difference
given the way Dave has defined the <P> element in HTML+.  All of the
current primers could be changed within a single day if people on this
list get it in their heads to do so.  Given the rate of change on the Web 
and the current lack of established authoring tools for HTML, I think
95% of HTML authors would be using <P> as a container within 3 months.
Furthermore, a simple script could be written to reformat most existing
HTML documents (a generic parser for SGML is unnecessary and less useful
because it cannot intuit the intentions behind the elements).  Naturally,
some of the more "artistic" documents would require hand-editing, but 
they are rarely conforming to begin with.  I'll write the script myself
once I get done with my stack of current scripts-to-write (at least a
month's worth already).  Hopefully, several other people will have already
done so by then.

Sorry, but I think that's a terrible idea.  It would give us two syntactic
forms for a single semantic structure -- that of a paragraph -- where only
one form is necessary.  In addition, a <PP> element would be ignored by ALL
existing clients whereas using <P> as a container is already accepted by
most.

Inferring </p> tags would be is easy. Well... at least the SGML standard says
how to do it in a way that's consistent with current practice in HTML.

It's the start tags (<p>) that cause trouble.

>When we get to a point where we support stylesheets (PLEASE!) it is of

Counter-argument: The MidasWWW browser had a really nifty stylesheet-based
hypertext widget set, and it grokked empty P elements just fine. Something
like:
	*HTML*BODY.font: ...
	*HTML*BODY*P.breakBefore: True
	*HTML*BODY*P.breakAfter: True

Agreed.

It is straightforward to construct DTD's where (1) is content of
the BODY element. The draft-iiir-html-01 version of the html DTD
did this. My recent html version 1.7.2.4 also does this.

I think it is impossible to construct a DTD where (1) is the
content of a P element without doing stuff like "The first
element of a BODY element must be a P."

>  And if we build stylesheets which allow logical

Body.

The declarations
    <!ELEMENT BODY O O (#PCDATA|P|OL|UL|DL|H1...)>
    <!ELEMENT P - O EMPTY>
are consistent with current practice.
I have considerable evidence to back that claim.

Parsing extant documents relative to delcarations like
	<!ELEMENT BODY O O (P|UL|OL|...) -- no #PCDATA -->
	<!ELEMENT P - O (%htext)+>
results in errors.

If there is sufficient motivation to change all the documents out
there to move #PCDATA out of BODY and into a subordinate paragraph
element (which I agree is a good idea), why not call give that
element a new name like PP while we're at it?

This is a reasonable argument. In fact, I agree completely.
I'm sure I could augment html-mode.el to do this while it's putting
quotes around attribute values, for example.

The question is: which way is the momentum out there? Will folks
really clean up their stuff? How long will it be before I can
use an SGML parser and a P container with reasonable results
on real stuff out there?

The fact remains that stuff parses as-is with the empty P element.
So if anybody's interested in an immediate informational RFC, that's
the way it's got to be.

Whether there's anything between html.dtd v 1.7.2.4 and HTML+ remains
to be seen.

Again, I'll assert that <P> is a separator and <PP> is a container. Two
different things.

So write
	<PP>Here's my para<p></pp>

and it'll work everywhere. When <pp> is well established, just
s/<p>//g and be done with it. I guarantee that's a lot easier and
more reliable than the script that changes <p> from a separator
to a container.

It is <p> text contained within the <body>, as can be inferred by any
SGML (or just HTML+) parser.

> And if we build stylesheets which allow logical elements within the

The default <p> style, naturally, since there must exist one for any such
scheme to be backward compatible.  The default <p> style could be based
on the context (i.e. defined according to the current hierarchy of elements
which contain the paragraph) -- e.g. a nested list within a quotation would
have a particular default style.  In fact, that is how existing clients
behave already (though it may not be their intention).  Custom-styled
paragraphs would require the use of explicit <P>s.

BTW, your example would format something like this in HTML+:

  ---------------------Example---------------------
  This is text with no container. (1)
      
  Perhaps this is text in a 

  container. (2)

  Hmmm... no 

  associated with the previous
  
  !  Do we assume that there was to be one, or do we treat 

  as a break? (3)
  -------------------------------------------------

Granted, it would not look like that on existing clients, but then
people generally don't write malformed HTML on purpose and thus we
need not require clients to render malformed HTML consistently.

Yes, but isn't this requiring some serious dog-wagging?  One of the major
reasons for enabling the parsing of documents is to make it easier for
authors editing in the raw to produce good HTML (those using pre-structured
editors would not need an external parser).  A <PP> container would make
it substantially harder to read and produce raw HTML and thus would defeat
its own purpose.

I would much rather enforce the <HEAD> and <BODY> containers than add
the <PP> element, even though I agree that it would be extremely difficult
to do so.  The <HEAD> and <BODY> containers will become a necessity in
the future for reasons beyond paragraph parsing.  Why do we keep putting
this off?  Is there some expectation that, the longer we wait, changing
this policy will become easier?  I say do it now and get it over with.

Just to let you know -- I really support your effort.  I would
be happy to have ORA/GNN can host an archive of tools/DTDs.
At any rate, I think it is meaningful for ORA to back
this effort as we are probably the largest producer of
HTML documents.

Good point. But let's get back to basics. Here are my working assumptions:

	1. An HTML document shall be a conforming SGML document.
	2. Existing documents and browsers define current practice,
	with tutorials and ideas in folks' head a close second.

>From these, it is necessary to draw the conclusion:

	3. #PCDATA is allowed in <BODY>.

It is still possible to define P as a container, but there's little to
be gained. You'd end up with stuff like:

	<BODY>
		Here's Para 1.
		<P>
			Here's Para 2.
		</P>
		<P>
			Here's Para 3.
		</P>
	</BODY>

and I hope nobody is interested in that.

>I would much rather enforce the <HEAD> and <BODY> containers than add
>the <PP> element, even though I agree that it would be extremely difficult
>to do so.

It is not difficult. The HTML element in html.dtd. version 1.7.2.4 is
defined as:
	<!ELEMENT HTML O O (HEAD, BODY)>

The SGML parser infers, using standard techniques, that
	<TITLE>title</TITLE>
	<H1>foo...</H1>
means
	<HTML><HEAD>
	<TITLE>title</TITLE>
	</HEAD>
	<BODY>
	<H1>foo...</H1>
	</BODY>

The change was to allow OMITTAG YES in the SGML declaration. I also
turned on SHORTTAG, cuz folks seem to use that too.

This puts us in the position where there are a lot of constructs that
are legal according to the dtd and declaration that don't work in
Mosaic. But marked sections an comments have been in that category
for quite some time. (Comment processing in Mosaic is somewhat broken.)

In current practice, it's not an issue.

Well, I can help you with two of the names, since one of them
is my brother!

Eric Bina and Marc Andreesen (who started out as a student
employee of Eric's) conceived, designed, and wrote Mosaic.
After they created the X version from scratch, and it
caught on, they helped some other NCSA employees write
versions of their software for other platforms.

[Daniel W. Connolly]
|   Inferring </p> tags would be is easy. Well... at least the SGML
|   standard says how to do it in a way that's consistent with current
|   practice in HTML.
|
|   It's the start tags (<p>) that cause trouble.

Currently in HTML, <p> tags represent divisions between paragraphs.  This 
implies that there is nothing that can occur before or after a paragraph that 
could also occur within a paragraph.

Given these conditions, if the DTD were to be rewritten to use 'p' elements as 
containers instead of divisions, it would be possible to specify BOTH the start 
and end tags as omissible.

When parsing current HTML documents with the new DTD, an SGML parser would 
usually infer the initial <p>, and infer a </p> before each explicit <p>.

The one exception is that leading empty paragraphs specified with a <p> 
_immediately_ following the enclosing start tag would be ignored.

Try it. It just doesn't work that way. An SGML parser can only infer
required start tags.

Subject: NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows v2.0alpha3 release
content-length: 5256

We are happy to announce the release of  NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows
Version 2.0alpha3.  NCSA Mosaic is a network navigational tool that will
allow you to easily access networked information with the click of a button.
Mosaic is capable of accessing data via protocols such as Gopher, World
Wide Web, FTP and NNTP (Usenet News) natively, and other data services
such as Archie, WAIS, and Veronica through gateways.  NCSA Mosaic was
designed to provide its user transparent and seamless access to these
information sources and services.  There are now two versions of Mosaic.  
The most common version is wmos20a3.zip, it was created for Windows 3.1, 
Windows for Workgroups, and Windows NT(80X86). The other version, decmosa3.zip, 
was compiled for DEC alpha's running Windows NT.                                                     

NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows is a WinSock client program.  It requires
network (TCP/IP) access through the WinSock DLL interface.  If you are using
Windows NT, this is built in. If you are using Windows 3.1, you need to
obtain a WinSock and install it on your system.  If you are running a
commercial TCP/IP stack, such as FTP Software, Novell, PCNFS, etc., you
will need to obtain that vendors winsock.dll.  If you need a winsock.dll and
you would like to obtain a shareware product called the "Trumpet Software 
International Winsock", you can find the latest version at ftp site, 
ftp.utas.edu.au.  The file winsock.zip is in the pc/trumpet/winsock directory.

Version 2.0alpha3 is also a 32-bit application and it requires the win32s
software.  Win32s allows you to run 32-bit Windows applications, which do
not use Windows NT-specific features, under Windows 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups.  Win32s was developed by Microsoft and it is freely distributed
to licensed users of Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups.  If you
already use other 32-bit Windows applications then you should already have
this software installed in your /windows/system/win32s directory.  If Mosaic
is your first 32-bit application then you will need to obtain the win32s.zip
file from our ftp server.  You can get to this file via Mosaic by clicking on
the "Obtaining a new version of Mosaic for MS Windows" link on our home page
and following the link to win32s.  You can also find it in the /PC/Mosaic 
directory of our anonymous ftp server.

Version 2.0alpha3 of Mosaic is available via anonymous FTP on NCSA's FTP
server, "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu"(141.142.20.50).  Mosaic, wmos20a3.zip is in the
/PC/Mosaic directory.

Here's what's new:
                
Mosaic is now a 32-bit application
printing (still has problems with bold, long documents, and images)
Viewing/Saving of document source
Access authentication
GPF on forms reloading fixed
Case insensitive find implemented
GPF with Find Dialog fixed
Vertical scrollbars no longer disappear in large files
horizontal scrollbars now appear for documents wider than the screen
Improved internal audio support - allows playing of .au files on 8-bit cards
Bug with deeply nested tags fixed
"-i <inifile>" command-line option for INI file location
<OPTION> tags won't crash Mosaic anymore
fixed bug with downloading files via FTP
FTP slightly improved - now able to connect to ftp.microsoft.com, e.g.
<em> and <strong> tags now supported
<dir> and <menu> tags are now more properly supported
Grey out back & forward when no current doc
When search window disappears, focus switches to main window.
"Add Current to Hotlist" when current hl is QUICKLIST now works (unlimited size)
"Add Current to Hotlist" works for URL's without titles  (gopher servers)
Open URL Dialog now fits on a 640 x 480 screen
entity (&) termination
Focus switches to Search window when it appears
better filename mungeing ( Unix files will now be converted to reflect the last 
        extension.  ie. here.it.is.txt  will become here.txt)

Your comments on NCSA Mosaic are important; user feedback is an
integral part of the Software Development Group's (SDG's) planning
activities.  Bug reports are particularly valuable because SDG's tests
cannot duplicate all user environments and equipment configurations.
Bug reports should include enough information to enable SDG developers 
to reproduce the problem.  Please specify any information given by Mosaic, 
and give us a URL so we can try to reproduce the problem.  However, before 
you send any bug reports, comments, or suggestions, please check our on line 
information to ensure your information has not already been reported.  This 
will be very helpful to us because we are swamped with email.  You can find
on line information about known bugs, enhancement requests, FAQ's, viewers,
etc. from our home page.

If the answer to your question is not included in the above sources of
information, then please email us at mosaic-w@ncsa.uiuc.edu and we will reply 
as quickly as we can.  Please remember we are supporting NCSA Mosaic and we
can not provide information about the location of specific resources on the net.  

Thank you for your interest and support.

One thing I haven't seen made clear, at least from my perspective, is
the need for a paragraph container.  Maybe it's just that I don't know
SGML well enough to see the benefits when approached from that angle,
but since it has from the beginning always been considered a separator,
and has been used by most people successfully as such, why change it
now?  

I fully understand the presentation vs. structure argument - but I'm
not convinced everything needs to be contained within descriptive
tagged areas to placate the structuralists.

Maybe a better argument would be... is there ever a situation where
it can't successfully be inferred?  There is obviously a set of 
tags which will never appear between a <P> and a </P> (like <H*>,
<FORM...>, <*L>, etc.) so it seems to me like </P> would be
redundant.

Or maybe I'm just worried about the 500 HTML pages I'd have to update
to account for this </P> daemon.  I already have enough fun maintaining
two versions of every form, one for SGI's with broken X servers, one
for everyone else. :)

You won't.  Nobody will adopt it should it actually appear.  (I'm not
being belligerent, I'm just stating a fact -- document creators won't
go for it.)

To be honest I don't think people have a clear idea of how to handle
<P>'s currently; I thought a </p> was a paragraph spearator at one
point... Using <p> as a container is as clear an idea as using it as a
separator, and close to other HTML constructs like <A>,<H2> etc.

Quite. But I think it is more important that the general browsers can
deal with HTML+ structures than to overnight convert every document
out there. That would enable a transistory period in which people can
at least start writing new docs in HTML+.

Agreed. There is confusion enough without constructs like <pp><p></pp>.

> In addition, a <PP> element would be ignored by ALL existing clients
> whereas using <P> as a container is already accepted by most.

Very true, and I don't see why people get so upset about it.  Since I
got my hands on psgml I'm writing HTML+, and use <p></p> as a
container. I even use the optional end-tag which Dave points out is
not needed and makes the doc closer to HTML. Works well enough for
general use.

It would be nice if current browsers would ignore <p> start tags after
things like <LI> and <H2>. People who do think <p> is a paragraph
separator won't put one one after a <LI> or <H2> for a reason other
then 'fixing' unflexible browsers, which is the wrong solution, so I
don't see any reason not to do this. Similarly Mosaic gets confused
about </OPTION> tags in a form. I haven't found any other problems.

With these things fixed people can start writing HTML+, use <p> as a 
container, and view old HMTL docs happily.  Roy's converting tools (:)
will be able to cleanup old docs. What is so wrong with that?

Not really. The current stuff about the DTD seems to have somewhat swamped my 
suggestion.

>The browsers can't tell what type a URL is by parsing the link.

Could you elaborate? It seems to me that they can. If a link is of the form 

  http://site/path/blah.html     its an html file
  http://site/path/blah.tif      its an image, etc.

Sure if someone defined *.gif to be text/html in their servers list of mime 
types that might be a problem, but that would be perverse in the extreme. How 
many html pages are there on the web, and what percentage of them do not have a 
file type of .html or .htm (for broken DOS systems ;-0 )

All a browser would have to do is detect that the link it is about to follow is 
to an html file, switch on or off image types in the accept field as 
appropriate, then add multipart/mixed in the accept field.

Marc suggested that my suggestion wasted already cached images, which is true; 
but then if they are all retrieved in a block the inefficiency is not that 
great.

An alternative would be to have the browser construct a list of images in the 
current document that are not in the browsers cache; however extending the 
syntax of a GET to allow lists seems a bigger task. Could be the way to go, 
though.

Apart from that, and Marc's comment, the topic seems to have sunk without trace. 
A pity; it seemed such a simple, largely impact free optimisation, primarily 
using  existing technology.

Unless you have a validated crystal ball implementation, you are stating an 
opinion. Perhaps based on wide experience, but an opinion none the less.

>-- document creators won't go for it.)

You mean, creators of existing documents won't update or creators of existing 
documents won't change for new documents or new creators of documents won't 
adopt the new usage ;-)

If the tutorials are updated - and one of them already describes the <p> ... 
</p> form, which is already accepted by Mosaic for X - new users will clearly 
use the new form because they will not know any different. Users of conversion 
tools will use the new form without realising it because their tools will use 
the new form. Users of less primitive tools than a straight text editor will use 
the new form because they will not see actually type in the tags themselves.

I see no reason why existing html authors will not accept the change for new 
documents. It is trivial and makes the <p> tag consistent with other tags. 

And all us html writers are the crest of a new wave, hip to the future, right? 
So describing the old form as 'obselete', 'old-style', 'deprecated' and 'still 
supported for backwards compatibility' will be a potent use of our fashion 
victim status to encourage us to change ;-) ;-)

That leaves existing documents. 


Ones that have been converted, eg from LaTeX or Frame, can be re-converted using 
newer versions of ht ese tools - which will happen anyway to documents that are 
being maintatained. 

For manually written documents, a widely available awk script to update them 
would be a help here. Documents that are actively being maintained or re-used 
for other purposes will likely (IMHO) be converted. Others will not.

Whether you see this as a problem depends on whether you see the current mass of 
web documents as being a substantial proportion of the web in, say, 5 years 
time, or whether you see them as merely the tip of the iceberg. I tend to the 
latter view.

Yes, but costs are also an issue. Many of us (including me)

It doesn't work with the DTD you provided, but my reasoning works like like 
this:  If <p> tags divide a body into paragraphs, then a body must contain at 
least one paragraph (no P tags), and can consist of only paragraphs.  With this 
content model, it works just fine:

<!DOCTYPE TEST [
<!ELEMENT TEST O O (HEAD, BODY)>
<!ELEMENT HEAD O O (TITLE)>
<!ELEMENT TITLE - - (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT BODY O O (P+)>
<!ELEMENT H1 - - (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT P O O (H1|#PCDATA)*>
]>
<TITLE>testing</TITLE>
<H1>Here we go...</H1>
This is no problem now.
<p>This would be fine
<p>And so would this.

The constraints on the content model I have in my last article were too loose 
(oops).

The DTD Dan gave implied that some things in HTML besides <p> tags can start 
and end paragraphs.  If this is a requirement, then it does cause problems.

Wait a minute.  URLs are not required to have an extension and (as you
pointed out) the extension is not significant with HTTP/1.0.  I have
created servers that generate GIF images accessed via a URL like:

	http://site/myurlformatisnoneofyourbusiness

and respond with:

	Content-type: image/gif

This is not perverse.  It is just following the spec.

Now we should either require reliable type information in URLs or not.
But relying on URL extensions is a bad idea unless they are a well
defined part of the spec -- and they currently are not.
 
Specifically for inlined images the client might infer the type is some
kind of image because the URL appears within <IMG SRC="...">.  But that
is different than using the URL extension.

I would be in favor of this variation.  It doesn't waste the cached images, and
it frees the server from having to scan the outgoing html files to construct the
list of images.  The browser gets the list free...it MUST parse the html file.
Also, allowing GET of a list (probably allowing multiple GET's in a single
request) shouldn't be that much of a different effort compared with having the
server automatically send the images.  In both cases, the server still has to
support sending multipart/mixed messages.  It's just a question of how the list
is constructed.  Also, the client would need to understand multipart/mixed
responses from the server to benefit, in either case.

How should/would one send the multiple requests?  It would not be feasible
to say GET url1 url2 url3, as this would interfere with GET url HTTP/1.0.
Perhaps an X-header?

I don't think we should go so far as to have a new method just for
retrieving multipart messages.

As for the returned message, how about something like this to send foo.gif,
bar.xbm, and baz.xpm?

I did not address this originally because my original post covered a different 
senario. It now seems necessary, because the cost - money cost, for the real 
world - of ignoring cached images is too great and because the overhead of 
parsing the html files on the server side is also a drawback.

I was trying to get the HTTP spec to look at, but CERN is down (again) and the 
HENSA cache doesn't have it, currently. Oh well. I was about to find an unused 
character to join the urls with. This is analogous to using + for space when 
sending queries with get.

Lets say & is unused. A possible syntax would be

  GET multi&url1&url2&url3 HTTP/1.1

A problem I see with this - is there a max line length for a GET command?

Failing which we may be into using POST....

Sorry about the vagueness, folks; I must print out the spec next time it becomes 
available.

   Hmmm - I think it would be a bad idea to hardcode something like this
into the standard.  URLs are supposed to be opaque to the client.

>A problem I see with this - is there a max line length for a GET command?

   Depends... there is if you farm out to a shell command (like
/cgi-bin/xxx).  I am not sure if any of the servers have a hardcoded limit
(I seriously doubt it, but you never know).

>Failing which we may be into using POST....

   This would be totally against the 'spirit' of post I believe.

 o Made dialogs rise to the top when selected a second time.
 o Added 24bit DirectColor support.
 o Added 16bit TrueColor support.
 o Changed dithering to Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
 o 2 color images go to black & white on monochrome, instead of dithering.
 o FORM now uses ENCTYPE and ENCENTITY to submit encrypted if PEM_AUTH
   defined.
 o New menu under "Options" to always request enrypted if PEM_AUTH defined.

Whoops!  I think you forgot to turn off a FORMs-debugging  
option...the new X Mosaic 2.3 prints out the NAMEs of many FORM  
widgets beside them!

By the way, the new X widget naming changes you were probably  
debugging with this can crash X Mosaic 2.3.  Check out  
"http://www.geom.umn.edu/apps/quasitiler/start.html" for example.

This isn't possible currently: links are not, in general, typed. You
can't tell, looking at the link, whether it is image, text, audio,
video, an equation, or a Macintosh program.

No, we backed way off from that for HTTP/1.0, and it seems to be
working well.

Can't be done without at least establishing a connection and doing a
HEAD.  And it's a waste to incur that expense when there are easier
solutions.

Filename extensions provide hints at file contents in environments
where nothing else is available (e.g. FTP, HTTP/0.9) but should NOT be
used except in places where nothing else is available.

The fact that some servers use filename extensions as the mechanism
for authors to inform the server what the file type is is totally
separate from how servers and clients tell one another about it.  It's
just a temporary accident.  Filenames on, say, a Macintosh are
unlikely to tend to end with .html or .gif suffixes since the file
type information is stored elsewhere.

In the long run (IMHO) suffixes will be dropped from URLs as servers
get smart enough to know that a fetch for "foo" should return foo.html
(or foo.txt or foo.gif or foo.ps.gz or whatever form of foo is agreed
upon by standard content-type negotiation.)

In brief, don't do this.

This is still based on the assumption that the embedded objects are
small, the overhead for setting up the connection is large, and the
cost of transfering bytes is low.  These are not necessarily globally
applicable assumptions; they surely don't apply to SLIP/PPP
connections with slow modems, for instance.

As some others have pointed out lately, HTTP isn't even necessarily
strictly bound to TCP/IP; its simple request-response model could work
in other paradigms.

I believe something like this is the way to go.  Bear in mind that a
simple list of multipart/mixed with image/gif types will not be
sufficient for this syntax.  We need a solution that allows for a
situation like:

- Client fetches document.  It contains 6 embedded objects; let's
  assume they are all images (although there's no general reason to
  assume they couldn't be something else.)
- Client already has two of them in its cache, and just uses the
  cached versions.
- For simplicity, let's assume the other 4 are all from the same HTTP
  server although there's no reason to assume that would always be the
  case.
- Client requests those images.
  o One of them transfers normally.
  o One of them is cached, but the cached version has expired so the
    client uses the "If-modified-since" (or whatever it's being
    called) header to indicate that the document should only be
    transferred if it is newer than that date.  It turns out the
    cached version is still current, so the server just returns the
    appropriate code.
  o One of them has been moved, and the server returns a 301 redirect which
    the client must resolve.
  o One of them requires authorization, so the server returns the
    appropriate error code and the client may attempt an authorized
    transaction.

In other words, each of the items returned bundled up into a MIME
multipart structure must be not just a media type but the full server
response including headers.  I suggested this bundled object be called
message/http-response, along with message/http-request, a long time
ago but nobody seemed much interested.  I can dig up the reasons why
"message" is the appropriate primary content-type if people want to
argue about it.

If the server is capable of sending several objects at once, the way
it would work would be to send a multipart/mixed message consisting of
many parts, each of them a message/http-response (or, if you want to
get carried away, you could create a multipart/http-digest which
implicitly typed each of its parts this way.)

The question then becomes one of how the client should express to the
server the idea of doing multiple things at once.  Here are some
random thoughts...

- Extend GET with something (say, MGET?) which allows arbitrarily many
  URLs on the first line.

  Presumably this would not work for existing servers (a casual test
  suggests it would work for Plexus and NCSA but not CERN) so a client
  would have to use a transaction to test whether it would work,
  caching the results so it doesn't have to test all the time.  It
  provides no way for handling the situation in which the request
  headers (e.g. the "If-modified-since" or others) are not the same
  for all the various items requested.

  For that matter, it's not clear to me how this could resolve issues
  like binding which of the responses goes with which of the requests.
  Simple ordering could work, but seems a bit brittle.

- Add some headers in the request indicating additional documents to
  fetch (i.e. you tell the server "Give me this, and if you can also
  maybe give me this and this and this")

  This would work with existing servers.  Otherwise it has nothing to
  recommend it.  It has the same limitations as the above.

- Have the client transmit to the server a document of type, say,
  multipart/mixed with many parts, each of them a
  message/http-request.  It's not clear to me what the method for this
  should be; POST, or maybe even some new one, seems appropriate.
  Each of the embedded requests would presumably be a GET, although
  there's no fundamental reason it couldn't be something else.

  This would not work for existing servers.  However, it is the only
  solution that properly permits different headers to be transmitted
  for each bundled request.

I believe the last of these options is the only viable way to keep
HTTP request/response but permit multiple requests to be transmitted
in a single connection.  Any solution that does not allow for the all
the different cases of the images discussed in the example above is,
IMHO, a non-starter.

And changing HTTP to be something other than request/response is a
non-starter to me, but that's a deeper issue.

Ready for the flames,

I believe that the client should do a normal initial request and the server
will indicate a willingness to do MGET by returning "Public: MGET".  The
client then indicates it's willingness by issuing the MGET request and
tells the server what reply formats it understands in with standard
"Accept:" headers.  There should be a well defined default so that
all clients and servers can talk to each other but we shouldn't rule
out future extensions.

It would go something like this:

client:
    GET whatever HTTP/1.0
    Comment: just a normal request
server:
    HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
    Accept: [the request formats we accept]
    Public: MGET

    [normal return data for whatever]
client (note that "whatever" in this request should probably be the
same as the above "whatever" for accounting purposes):
    MGET whatever HTTP/1.0
    Accept: [the reply formats we accept]
    Content-type: multipart/mixed

    [the various requests encoded as message/http-request]
server:
    HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
    Content-type: multipart/mixed

    [the various replys encoded as message/http-reply]

==============

One other issue we **URGENTLY** need to address is returning error responses
for http requests.  I've mentioned this in the past (several times in
fact) and it's been ignored but now that we have caching proxy servers
this has become *very* important (otherwise you have a useless system
that caches error messages forever).

The only solution that I can see is to move clients towards accepting
multipart messages and having servers return them whenever possible.  The
proxy gateways should be setup to always request multipart replies and
convert the data as needed for clients.

To elaborate on my previous message, here's a rough sketch of how I
think a sample transaction of fetching 4 different items from the same
server at once might work.  This is all rather rough and lots of
details would need to be hashed out, but intended to give the flavor
of how things might work.

REQUEST SENT TO SERVER:
***********************
MULTICOMMAND HTTP/1.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Accept: multipart/mixed
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="sample-boundary"

--sample-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-request

GET /foo/image-1.gif HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif
[ other various headers ]


--sample-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-request

GET /foo/image-2.gif HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif
If-modified-since: 10-Apr-94 00:00:03 GMT


--sample-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-request

GET /foo/image-3.gif HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif
[ etc etc ]


--sample-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-request

GET /foo/image-4.gif HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif
[ and so on ]


--sample-boundary--
**************
END OF REQUEST

The above request would be sent to the server as a single unit.  The
server response might look something like the following:

SERVER RESPONSE:
****************
HTTP/1.0 200 Document Follows
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="response-boundary"
[ other assorted headers ]

--response-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-response

HTTP/1.0 200 Document Follows
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: image/gif

[GIF data goes here]
--response-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-response

HTTP/1.0 205 Cached Document Still Current
[ various headers ]


--response-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-response

HTTP/1.0 301 Permanent Relocation URI follows
Location: http://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/bogus/path/name.gif
[ various headers ]


--response-boundary
Content-Type: message/http-response

HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
[ blah blah ]


--response-boundary--
END OF RESPONSE

The above leaves a lot of details out, but gives the essence of how to
encapsulate multiple transactions together without losing the
flexibility of HTTP's content negotiation, response codes, and the
like.

CERN httpd is a generic hypertext server which can be used as a
regular HTTP server running typically on port 80 to serve hypertext
and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a firewall
machine -- that provides with access for people inside a firewall to
the outside world.  When running as proxy httpd may be configured to
do caching of documents.  Caching is still in beta test phase.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

CERN httpd 2.18beta is released, source code from:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/cern_httpd.tar.Z

This package includes EVERYTHING, so don't ftp the libwww.
Precompiled binaries are supplied for: Sun4, Solaris, HP, NeXT, Fat
NeXT-386, Decstation Ultrix and DEC OSF/1 under:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin

Precompiled binaries are all in cern_httpd_bins.tar.Z, which also
includes a default set of icons, and sample configuration files for
normal and proxy use.  README file is now also up-to-date, and may be
useful reading.  The plain httpd binary can be found in the same
directory, too.

For Sun4 there is also a cern_httpd_bins-lresolv.tar.Z which contains
an httpd linked with the -lresolv option.

Compilation for other Unix platforms should not be very complicated.
I would be happy to receive diffs, if any, to make it compile for
other platforms.  Also binaries other than those already on
info.cern.ch are welcome.

Current VMS version is still 2.16beta.

Documentation in:

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Guide.html

                     CERN HTTPD 2.18BETA RELEASE NOTES
 
New Features
 
     * Long FTP directory listing with last modification dates and sizes.
 
Fixes
 
     * Fixed a bad bug with Port directive -- server didn't fork but
       rather the parent process served which caused the service to
       eventually hang (this is the main reason for this release).
     * CLIENT_CONTROL removed from SOCKS mods since httpd has now native
       proxy protection support.
     * No longer fails to sometimes create .gc_info file.

Just to reiterate what others have said, I would mention that URLs (as
currently defined) don't include typing information unless specifically
required to enable you to access the object.

There is a logic beind this: typing information can be complex. It
actually can be very complex (one level up :-). As a result the general
consensus in the URI group of the IETF decided that it would be left out
of the URL (which after all is a Locator) and put it into some other
beastie. People have complained about this in the past, and I'm sure will
continue to do so. However, my gut feeling is that it was the right
decision. We'll have to wait for the next construct (URCs) to come along
to get all that nifty typing information as well as copyrights, author
names and the like. It is dangerous to use filename extensions to
determine file types.

Subject: NCSA httpd 1.2 now available
content-length: 4598


NCSA httpd 1.2 is now available via anonymous FTP from
ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/ncsa_httpd/current. Note that there is no
longer a binary distributed for the DECstation MIPS machines running
Ultrix as our DECstation 5000 died and it hasn't been fixed as of yet.

NCSA httpd is an HTTP/1.0 compatible server for hypermedia documents.
It runs on a plethora of UNIX systems. NCSA httpd is also compatible
with the Common Gateway Interface which allows interactive document
generation.

All of the documentation for NCSA httpd is online hypertext. See 
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/. If you cannot use a networked WWW browser to 
read it, retrieve the file /Web/ncsa_httpd/current/httpd_docs.tar.Z from
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu and use your WWW browser in local only mode to get things
started.

Note that the new features introduced with this release required some
internal restructuring of the code. This may cause some bugs. If you
are pleased with your current setup and do not need the new features
you may consider waiting before upgrading in order to make sure that
any problems (we expect none, but who ever does?) are worked out prior
to your upgrade.

By popular demand I have written a number of tutorials about various
aspects of NCSA httpd configuration. See
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/ for an index.

Thanks all

All of the following information is available at
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Upgrade.html in hypertext form. You
should probably read that instead of this primitive plaintext.

New features

    * The CGI interface is now revised to version 1.1.

    * A new logfile format was agreed upon which should simplify the
      lives of the authors of logfile analyzers if commonly adopted.

    * CGI scripts are now allowed anywhere.

    * The server side includes interface has been completely
      rewritten. It is NOT compatible with your old INC SRV documents
      but a filter is provided to transform your old documents into
      the new format.

    * There is a new access control option to disable symbolic links
      only if the owner of the pointer is not the same as the
      owner of that which is pointed to. This means your users can
      have symbolic links to things they own, but not to dangerous
      things like /etc.

    * A new access control method called mutual-failure has been
      added. This method is a bit unorthodox, but allows
      you to allow hosts from one domain while excluding certain hosts
      (such as public access machines) from that domain.

    * Wildcard expressions are now allowed in various areas of server
      configuration, to allow patterns to be specified. This is most
      useful in the Directory directive.

    * Directory indexing has been revamped. It looks much different,
      and I've written a short tutorial on how to set it up.

    * Access Control Files now allow the indexing directives as well
      as the DefaultType directive.

    * require user now allows quotes for PGP usernames with spaces.

    * Server now explicitly kills CGI scripts when the client aborts
      or upon timeout

    * Server now verifies the DNS hostname it gets from the IP number
      to prevent PTR spoofs.

    * Support for 304 and If-modified-since.

    * Support for CGI PUT and DELETE scripts. This will become
      important later for group annotation features.

Bug fixes

All of the known bugs in 1.1 have now been fixed. Now it's time to
find the ones I introduce with 1.2.

    * Fixed problem running scripts in ServerMode inetd under IRIX.

    * Fixed bad port problem under OSF/1.

    * Inserted missing return statement for the IdentityCheck directive.

    * Fixed problem whereby errors would stop being logged after a restart.

    * Fixed 256 character limitation on CGI URLs.

    * Access control fix from 1.1 integrated but moved in order to
      allow certain CGI scripts to continue functioning.

Thanks for that very clear description of the problem. There were a lot of 
things I hadn't considered, like expiry and redirect.

I was aware that HTTP/1.0 had moved from filename extensions to MIME types yet 
it still seemed to use file types on the server side to perform the MIME typing. 
99% of existing files on existing servers can be accurately typed by this 
method. I agree that is does not always work, though, and the number of cases 
where it will not work will increase as time goes on.

This does raise the problem that the user has lost some information, been 
disempowered in a sense. Previously, with browsers that show the URL of links as 
the pointer passes over them, you had some idea what you were fetching. An 
inline image used as a link; for example. I might see (using my naive ideas of 
file typing) that it is linked to large-figure.tif and deduce that it is 
therefore a bigger, possibly 24 bit, version of the inline image. Then again, it 
may be linked to more-on-this.html and I might (again perhaps erroneously) 
deduce that I will learn more about the subject of the figure by following the 
link.

In both cases, I am using typing information as an aid to my browsing or 
searching strategy.

If this information cannot be relied on, what is do I use instead. And if the 
URL contains no meaning, why display it in the browser?

When I write html documents I try to use meaningful document names and so on to 
guide the reader. An inline gif and a larger tiff version will have the same 
name but different extension, for example. Document filenames give an idea of 
the document's contents.

If this is wrong, how should the writer convey this information to the reader?

I realise this has moved from a technical proposal to document design and 
usability issues, so I have renamed the subject line.

Because as you've said yourself it is useful in 99% of the cases,
and because it gives an idea of the location of the file which
also aids browsing. Then again, there are a nuber of people who
actually think it shouldn't be displayd in the browser.

Describe it: See this <A HREF="...">big 24bit colour image</A>, and
get the <A HREF>complete 24M distribution</A>.

Subject: HTML Feature Test Entities, P as a container vs. separator
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 1994 14:06:05 -0500
From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 4995


On the Fate of P:

I gather that the general opinion is that HTML document
structure should look like:

<HTML>
 <HEAD>
  <TITLE>t</TITLE>
  ...
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
  <H1>head</H1>
  <P>
   p with
   <em>emphasis</em>
   in it
  </P>
  <UL>
   <LI>item 1</LI>
   <LI>item 2</LI>
  </UL>
 </BODY>
</HTML>

Unfortunately, the common way that this is coded is:

<TITLE>t</TITLE>
<H1>head</H1>
p with <em>emphasis</em> in it
<ul>
<li>item 1
<li>item 2
</ul>

The unfortunate part is that there's no DTD (well, none that I can find)
that will enable a conforming SGML parser to infer that structure from
that document. However, if folks are willing to put <P> tags at the
_beginning_ of every paragraph, it can be done.

My current solution is
	(1) Docs lacking <P> start tags are supported in a backwards	
	compatible mode of the DTD, ala:

<!DOCTYPE HTML [
	<!ENTITY % HTML.pSeparator "INCLUDE">
	<!ENTITY % html PUBLIC "-//connolly hal.com//DTD WWW HTML 1.8//EN">
	%html;
]>
<title>backwards compatiblem mode</title>
<H1>header</H1>
para 1
<p>
para 2

in this mode, the text of the paras are content of the BODY element,
and the P elements are empty, ala:

<HTML>
 <HEAD>
  <TITLE>back..</TITLE>
  ...
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
  <H1>head</H1>
  para1
  <P>
  para2
 </BODY>
</HTML>


	(2) In the standard usage of the DTD, paragraphs are containers
	and require explicit start tags, ala:

<!DOCTYPE HTML "-//connolly hal.com//DTD WWW HTML 1.8//EN">
<title>backwards compatiblem mode</title>
<H1>header</H1>
<p>para 1
<p>para 2

The parser infers:

<HTML>
 <HEAD>
  <TITLE>back..</TITLE>
  ...
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
  <H1>head</H1>
  <P>para1</P>
  <P>para2</P>
 </BODY>
</HTML>

From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>

I'm curious about the level of interest in publishing HTML standards
and promoting widespread agreement about the meaning of "HTML support"
in, for example, product literature.

Marc suggested we issue an informational RFC to document basically
what Mosaic and lynx do.

Somebody even piped up about doing something through an ISO WG or some
such.

I'm interested in establishing a formal definition of HTML -- perhaps
a few variants including "Minimal HTML Support" (no forms, no nested
lists, conforming SGML), "Mosaic-2.x Support" (where 2.x is some
future release of Mosaic which coincides with publication of a DTD
that it supports).

Perhaps HTML+ could be incorporated as a level of support.

I'm willing to maintain a test suite that defines the variants
of conformance.

But I discovered some time ago that writing user documentation is
beyond my scope of expertise. And we certainly need human-readable
descriptions of HTML to go along with the machine readable DTD and
test suite.

I have talked some with a writer from NCSA who might be able to help,
but it didn't sound like he had a lot of time to contribute.

Are most folks (including the NCSA Mosaic licensees) content to define
HTML as "whatever the latest release of Mosaic supports", or are we
interested in published specifications? And do we have resources to
contribute toward that end?

There are several reasons:

- On many computers Latin-1 is not the default character set, so codes
  above 127 would be mapped incorrectly.
- Using the SGML entities ensures that the file can be e-mailed (see

- Browsers that cannot display the characters, can -- in principle --

Yes !!
We need published specs...the current situation is plain looney...we
cannot expect the web to be treated seriously by developers if the current
state of the main data format is not defined. I think that we can certainly
get an RFC for HTML together....I am willing to help out.

Using Mosaic as the "standard setter" is quite alright for the moment, but we
shall eventually need some stability.

I could probably help out some there.  I'm not an extremely awesome
writer, but I can generally get my point across without too much
difficulty. 8-)

With all due respect to the NCSA folks, I think it might not be such a
great idea to define HTML as "whatever ... Mosaic supports."  The WWW
is larger than any one tool can hope to encompass.  Ideally, I'd like to see
a published spec, to which the various clients could claim compliance.
I have no problem, per se, with a multi-tiered approach (ie. "Minimal
HTML" and other levels of conformance), but I'd want to be careful not
to introduce too much complexity there.  I read somewhere once that
HTML was intended to be simple. 8-)

Here are what I think the most salient issues involved with
encapsulating multiple transactions into a single transaction, per my
earlier discussions of creating types message/http-request and
message/http-response to enclose these into multipart constructs.

I'd appreciate lively feedback and discussion on these, particularly
from MIME-gurus who know more about What is Right than I do (too bad
there's no easy way to cross-post this to the MIME mailing list.)  I'd
like to get together a registration for the new content-types if this
looks like the right way to go; I think having content-types for HTTP
requests and responses is overdue in any case and could be good for
things other than bundling them together for inlined images.

METHOD
------

When the client sends a multipart message containing many parts of
type message/http-request, what method should be used?  GET hardly
seems appropriate.  In a sense it is POSTing a message to be processed
by the server, so POST might be suitable.  Some have suggested MGET;
this might be OK but suggests that all the enclosed requests must be
GET requests, which won't necessarily be the case though it's likely
to be typical.  I used MULTICOMMAND in the example just off the top of
my head.  A new method also has the advantage that a server can
clearly indicate its support by including that method in the Public:
header.

IMHO there's no need for this method to have a path associated with it
(Tony suggested using the path of the document containing the multiple
links being requested for accounting; I think the Referrer: header is
where this information should go) which suggests not using any
existing method, since all require paths.  The first line might
therefore look like:

	  FOO HTTP/1.0

for whatever value of FOO we like.

HANDLING HTTP/0.9
-----------------

Before anyone shouts, keep in mind the fact that we're looking for a
general approach to this; for instance, a client may issue a bundled
request to a cache server, which in turn handles each of the requests,
some of which may involve working with old servers.

Requests of the old form, if there are any clients that still
generate them, are fairly easily handled by existing http-request
format since the first line will contain the version information.  It
might be desirable to force them to end with a blank line, as HTTP/1.0
requests do.

Responses are a little harder, since the client doesn't get to know
"how much" of the original part was read.  One approach would be to
force any HTTP/0.9 responses to begin with a blank line, to separate
the headers (of which there are none) from the body.

Should there be a version parameter set to either 0.9 or 1.0 (or
HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.0) appropriately, or is the implicit information
inside sufficient?  My inclination is to include one, but I'm not
sure.

BINDING
-------

How can you tell which of the many message/http-response objects goes
with which of the message/http-request objects?

One approach is to simply use ordering; the first response goes with
the first request, and so on.  This implicit association makes me feel
a bit uneasy.  It would be nice to have a more flexible model.  For
instance, I might send a bunch of requests to a cache server, which
then handles them in parallel and sends the results all back to me; it
might make it easier on it not to have to worry about ordering.

Another approach would be to associate a Content-ID with each of the
requests, and have each of the responses bear some indication of what
the Content-ID of the request being serviced was.  The most
appropriate existing header for this seems to be In-Reply-To.  Thus,
it might look sort of like this:

  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=foo

  --foo
  Content-Type: message/http-request
  Content-ID: <number1>

  GET /foo HTTP/1.0
  [ etc ]


  --foo
  Content-Type: message/http-request
  Content-ID: <number2>

  GET /bar HTTP/1.0
  [ some headers ]


  --foo--

with the multipart/mixed object returned structured like this:

   Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="bar"

   --bar
   Content-Type: message/http-response
   In-Reply-To: <number1>

   [ /foo data ]
   --bar
   Content-Type: message/http-response
   In-Reply-To: <number2>

   [ /bar data ]
   --bar--

The important part is that, IMHO, the binding between request and
response should go on as part of the MIME headers making up multiple
parts, and NOT as part of the HTTP requests and responses themselves,
which should pass through the encapsulation totally unchanged.

My inclination is that both will have to be tolerated; i.e. clients
should use a header like In-Reply-To if it's available, and default to
implicit binding from the ordering if it's not.

HANDLING THE FIRST LINE
-----------------------

HTTP requests and responses are syntactically MIME messages, except
for the first line of both the request and the response.  If there
were some MIME-ish way to separate this first line from the rest of
the data, the rest of it would be syntactically understandable by any
existing system that can handle message/rfc822 (which, as the primary
subtype of message, is what any MUA should treat unknown subtypes of
message as.)  This would mean HTTP requests and responses would "do
the right thing" if passed to any MIME mail reader, while the first
line is not a syntactically legal header and might cause some readers
to barf.

There are a couple of ways to handle this, but neither of them are
at all clean:
- Make multipart/http-{request,response}, which contains two body
  parts, the first line and the rest of the message.
- Put the first line into parameters (e.g.
  Content-Type: http/request; method=GET; path=/foo/bar.gif; version="HTTP/1.0"

My inclination is that the advantage from going to this ugliness is
not sufficiently great, but I'm open to being persuaded otherwise.

CACHE SERVERS
-------------

I'm not entirely clear on exactly how cache servers work, but am
inclined to think the above approach could also allow a client to send
a composite request to a cache server, which would then service each
of the requests (which may or may not be to the same HTTP server, or
could be to another higher-level cache server in a hierarchy, or
whatever.)  This also would allow other cache optimizations (e.g. a
cache server could send large numbers of HEAD or conditional GET
requests all at once to verify the currency of its cache more cheaply
than doing each one at a time.)  Mirrors also might work more
efficiently (a mirror could GET everything, or a site being mirrored
could even PUT everything that has changed when updates occur.)  Are
there any special considerations for cache servers and other
innovative HTTP variants not adequately addressed?

(BTW, as long as we're talking about cache servers, how do cache
servers handle negotiation of Content-Type?)

I'd appreciate feedback on this,
- Marc

In countries needing Latin-1 characters there is usually no problem.
If they don't show up correctly on the other side of the world who
cares -- they wouldn't understand it anyway.  Mosaic supports it ok,
I guess Lynx works just fine if the terminal understands them, so
my advise would be to use Latin-1.  I mean those ampersand things
make the source text look like hell, and currently it is still the
poor human-beings writing it with Emacs, not some HiTech HTML editors.


> - Using the SGML entities ensures that the file can be e-mailed (see

The guy designing these SGML entities was clearly someone whose mother
tongue didn't contain any of them.  Imagine what a pain it would be to
always type '&blaa;' instead of 'a' and '&bloo;' instead of 'o'.  This
text would look mighty horrible, never mind if I can email it.  (BTW,
&ouml; doesn't map to | if you clear the high-order bit, it's just
something he typed in because scandinavian terminals can be configured

Well, none of them do.  And this is the 90's, machines should have
those characters and not just approximate them.

Speaking for cern_httpd which is just a kind of client-server hybrid --
whatever works for both clients and servers will work for caching proxy.

Proxy becomes a client that can handle all the formats that the remote
client has Accept:ed, and presents them by wrapping them to MIME and
sending back.

The &ouml; form is strictly for authoring in environments where
&ouml is easier to enter than the 8-bit char (God help you if
you're in such a situation, but...)

If it were just a matter of getting through 7-bit data paths, all
these are representable in &#nnn; form as well.

A WWW implementation should act like an SGML parser and reduce
"&ouml;", "&#nnn;" and the single 8-bit char representation to the
same thing before further processing.

So a browser that handles "&ouml;" but doesn't handle raw 8-bit
chars is broken. For example, HTML2MIF tools generally contain
a big table to translate ISOLatin1 to the PostScript encoding used
by Frame. The same should be true of Mac-based browsers, EBCDIC
browsers, etc.

From: ebina@ncsa.uiuc.edu

It is with great embarrassment that I offer my apologies to the 2135
people who downloaded Mosaic 2.3 before I withdrew it.  In my rush to
get out a version that fixed the telnet URL security problem, I left in
an ugly flaw that caused Widget names to appear to the right of all
toggle buttons in all forms.  I'm very sorry for all the inconvenience
this may have caused.  I am now releasing Mosaic 2.4, which is identical
to 2.3 with the exception of fixing that one foolish oversight.

	- Eric



NCSA Mosaic for X 2.4 is now available.

..ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic:

  o Source in /Mosaic/Mosaic-source.

  o Binaries for SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3 (a.k.a. SunOS 5.3),
    AIX 3.2.4 with X11R5, IRIX 4.x, IRIX 5.1.x,
    DEC Alpha (OSF/1), DEC Ultrix, and HP/UX 9.x (700-series) in
    /Mosaic/Mosaic-binaries.

NOTE:  Binaries and source are now compressed with gnu zip to save
       space on our overloaded ftp server.

As always, thanks for all the feedback!

If you have any comments, questions, or problems with Mosaic 2.4,
please send mail to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Also please drop us a
note if you enjoy using Mosaic or if you are using it in any
interesting projects or applications -- we love to hear from our
users!

Changes from version 2.3 to version 2.4 include:

 o Fixed really embarassingly dumb bug that made widgets names appear
   next to toggle buttons on forms.

Changes from version 2.2 to version 2.3 (in case you never saw 2.3) include:

 o Fixed security bug in telnet URLs.  <--This is the IMPORTANT change,
   and the reason for this early release. For details see:
   http://south.ncsa.uiuc.edu/telnet-details.html
 o Fixed bug with dithered images inverting on some displays.
 o Fixed bug with non-direct-WAIS clients core dumping on WAIS URLs.
 o Fixed bug with uninitialized gatewayed for proxy gateways.
 o Fixed memory overrun in PEM_AUTH code.
 o Fixed loss of small messages in PEM_AUTH code.
 o Fixed improper defaults for VerticalScrollOnRight.
 o Fixed more GIF decoding core dumps.
 o Fixed mispelling of XtSpecificationRelease in gui.c
 o Fixed 24bit handling bug that caused some displays to switch red and blue.
 o Added names to child widgets in forms.
 o Added autoconfiguration of MOTIF1_2 based on XmVERSION and XmREVISION.
 o Made dialogs rise to the top when selected a second time.
 o Added 24bit DirectColor support.
 o Added 16bit TrueColor support.
 o Changed dithering to Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
 o 2 color images go to black & white on monochrome, instead of dithering.
 o FORM now uses ENCTYPE and ENCENTITY to submit encrypted if PEM_AUTH
   defined.
 o New menu under "Options" to always request enrypted if PEM_AUTH defined.

Does the proxy assume that any format available in the cache is
preferable to all other formats? For example:

Fred really likes to read text/plain cuz it's fast, but his
browser supports applictaion/postscript too.
Joe really likes to read application/postscript cuz it looks good.

Fred bops to http://host/file.multi. It's not in the proxy cache,
so the proxy uses Fred's profile to get it from the remote source.
The remote source returns the text/plain version, as per Fred's
preferences.

The Joe bops across the same link. Does the proxy server give
him the text version from the cache or does it notice that
the client profiles are different and go accross the wire?

(The proxy should also pay attention to the vary=... info
returned from the original remote fetch: if there is no vary=
parameter, it can (according to the spec) assume there are
no other formats available for that URI)

Note that the "any local format is preferable to all remote
formats" heuristic makes the proxy not quite invisible; i.e. the proxy
doesn't always act just like a fast version of the remote
server.

    Not really, I think the most 'featureful' browser should be used as the
standard.  Which would definitely have to be the excellent violaWWW.  It is
real close to 100% HTML+ conformance (as is emacs-w3, but in diff areas).

    Of course, from the teasing gifs, it looks like Dave Raggett's browser
will blow the doors off both :)

    We discussed this at the TEI-WWW meeting in ireland and had decided to
have 'levels' of browsers.  Here is an excertp from the notes we put
together at the end of the meetings:

	o Browsers may implement different levels of HTML+ conformance.
		* Level 0 implementation
			+ HTML 1.0 spec referenced above
		* Level 1 implementation
			+ Partial fill-out forms
			+ New entity definitions (in section 5.1 of HTML+
			  draft)
		* Level 2 implementation
			+ Additional presentation tags (sub, sup, strike)
			  & logical emphasis
			+ Full forms support (incl.  type checking)
			+ Generic emphasis tag
		* Level 3 implementation
			+ Figures
			+ NOTEs and admonishments
		* Further levels to be specified

   There was some discussion of this after the notes were put on the web,
and most seemed to agree that it was a good thing.  I definitely do _NOT_
think this should be based on what any one browser does (unless it is dsr's
html+ browser :)

Yes, because it doesn't know it was a result of multiformat
negotiation -- in short, today's proxy doesn't understand the first
thing about multiformats but since it's not a widely used feature
it's not a burning issue.  Once clients have multilanguage support
it will be.

This sounds good...at least it is well defined. It would mean that
there would be no excuse for level 'n' browsers to have different
HTML capabilities to other level 'n' browsers.
The above would need to be elaborated upon, of course.

Of course, for the above to work, we would really need for each level back
to 0 to be specified.

I disagree. It may not be the default character set, but ISOLatin1 is defined as 
the character set that HTML uses. It is transfered in 8 bit mode, so it arrives 
intact. Browsers which use some other character set in the hope that common 
letters will occupy the same cose positions are therefore, as I see it, broken.

If a particular platform does not use ISOLatin1 and does not have a font that 
uses the ISOLatin1 encoding, it is up to the browser to do something sensible 
about it. Naively using a different encoding is not something sensible. Using 
code mapping tables, overstrike, and so on is.

Bert's statement contains a hidden assumption

[ assumption; browsers should/will not do any code translation]
> so codes

That assumption is not correct, IMHO.

If browsers on EBCDIC platforms were to display a, b, c etc incorrectly that 
would definitely be considered brokem. I submit that just because my native 
language happens not to need an a acute or a u umlaut, that is no reason to 
consider these characters any less important, or rendering them correctly to be 
an optional little detail.

>- Using the SGML entities ensures that the file can be e-mailed (see
>  what became of your &oumlaut; above...)

Indeed. So browsers should certainly map these characters to 7 bit clean 
versions, or use quoted printable, or base 64 encoding, or whatever when mailing 
html files from the browser. That is a separate issue, concerned with reusing 
the html file for something other than it's original purpose.

I see no reason to insist that people type these things in. For some people, it 
is part of their language. They do not normally have to type these things in in 
a special way; there are characters on their keyboards with the symbols on, they 
press them, and get the correct letter.

Consider, for example, if a s&letterT;an&letterD;ar&letterD;s bo&letterD;y 
ou&letterT;side your coun&letterT;ry (which happene&letterD; no&letterT; 
&letterT;o use &letterT;he le&letterT;&letterT;ers "t or "d") 
insis&letterT;e&letterD; tha&letterT; you en&letterT;er all &letterT;ex&letterT; 
in &letterT;his way

How inconvenient this would be!!

- Browsers that cannot display the characters, can -- in principle --
  approximate them.

Agree absolutely. Whether the character is transferred as an 8 bit 
representation - perfectly valid when the transport is guaranteed to be 8 bit 
clean - or as an entity reference (is that the correct term?) is however 
orthogonal to how the browser choses to represent or approximate them.

I disagree. It may not be the default character set, but ISOLatin1 is defined as 
the character set that HTML uses. It is transfered in 8 bit mode, so it arrives 
intact. Browsers which use some other character set in the hope that common 
letters will occupy the same cose positions are therefore, as I see it, broken.

If a particular platform does not use ISOLatin1 and does not have a font that 
uses the ISOLatin1 encoding, it is up to the browser to do something sensible 
about it. Naively using a different encoding is not something sensible. Using 
code mapping tables, overstrike, and so on is.

Bert's statement contains a hidden assumption

That assumption is not correct, IMHO.

If browsers on EBCDIC platforms were to display a, b, c etc incorrectly that 
would definitely be considered brokem. I submit that just because my native 
language happens not to need an a acute or a u umlaut, that is no reason to 
consider these characters any less important, or rendering them correctly to be 
an optional little detail.

>- Using the SGML entities ensures that the file can be e-mailed (see
>  what became of your &oumlaut; above...)

Indeed. So browsers should certainly map these characters to 7 bit clean 
versions, or use quoted printable, or base 64 encoding, or whatever when mailing 
html files from the browser. That is a separate issue, concerned with reusing 
the html file for something other than it's original purpose.

I see no reason to insist that people type these things in. For some people, it 
is part of their language. They do not normally have to type these things in in 
a special way; there are characters on their keyboards with the symbols on, they 
press them, and get the correct letter.

Consider, for example, if a s&letterT;an&letterD;ar&letterD;s bo&letterD;y 
ou&letterT;side your coun&letterT;ry (which happene&letterD; no&letterT; 
&letterT;o use &letterT;he le&letterT;&letterT;ers "t or "d") 
insis&letterT;e&letterD; tha&letterT; you en&letterT;er all &letterT;ex&letterT; 
in &letterT;his way

How inconvenient this would be!!

>- Browsers that cannot display the characters, can -- in principle --

Agree absolutely. Whether the character is transferred as an 8 bit 
representation - perfectly valid when the transport is guaranteed to be 8 bit 
clean - or as an entity reference (is that the correct term?) is however 
orthogonal to how the browser choses to represent or approximate them.

Hmm, you know, on further thought, I'm not certain I like the idea of
"levels" of HTML.  Exactly why is this necessary?  I think it has
great potential to make things much more confusing.  With all these
different levels of support, how will a client know what level of HTML
the document supports?  What happens if it gets a document which
conforms to a higher level than it does?

It seems to me that perhaps anyone who's not using one of the most
featureful browsers (such as Mosaic) is going to get screwed over when
it comes to browsing.  Many of the people who offer HTML documents are
WWWeenies (hey, myself included 8-), who love nothing better than to
include lots of neat-o HTML tricks in their documents.  Anyone with a
browser which does not conform to the higher levels of the spec would
be lost when viewing these pages.  Of course, it'd be nice if both
document providers and document consumers would migrate up the food
chain into sophisticated tools which support high levels of the spec,
but then we've wasted the time we put into defining the lower levels.

I propose instead that each distinct draft of the HTML (HTML+?) specs
be assigned a version number.  This would allow a tangible, definitive
specification for HTML to be established, and also allow it to be
enhanced without the confusion of trying to figure out exactly what
constitutes "standard" HTML and what doesn't.  Clients can still claim
conformance to a specific version number, which is similar to claiming
conformance to a level of HTML, but since only one level is current at
any given time, there should be no confusion over what your browser
supports.

Comments?  Am I worrying about nothing?  I don't think so, but I'd
love to hear what other document providers and consumers think about
this.

Well, I reckon that there will always be "clients and clients". That is,
there shall always be some clients that simply cannot handle the more
sophisticated features that others can. At the moment, there are as many
"levels" of HTML as there are clients. By creating some kind of a level
system or a versioning system of HTML, client developers can strive to
meet the next highest level. This ensures that there is only a very finite
number of possible "levels" and the HTML capabilities of a particular
client are immediately apparent.

I don't think so...the lower level specs will be needed for those upwardly
mobile clients.

This is very similar to the level system...obviously the higher the level
of your client the better, so I suppose only "one level is current".

I reckon we more or less agree with each other, except that you are
proposing that the versions be defined as development takes
place...however, I still think that we shall need to decide what is "base
HTML".

Subject: compiled HTML?
Date: Tue, 12 Apr 94 09:16:09 -0400
content-length: 2042

A random thought: the way the Web currently works, browsers are
required to also function as interpreters of HTML, taking unformatted
documents with formatting directives and producing formatted
documents, as well as handling the client side of the http protocol.
Does it make sense to consider providing an option of decoupling these
functions by defining a "compiled-HTML" format (henceforth C-HTML)
that would require considerably less processing on the client side?
C-HTML would be like .dvi to HTML's .tex; there would be a compiler
that would generate C-HTML from HTML. It would have the disadvantages
that the client would not be able to reshape the document to fit its
window or local style-sheet, but it might have the advantage of
speeding up document transmission. Whether there would be speedup
depends on a complex mix of factors: the expansion ratio of
HTML->C-HTML conversion plus network transmission speeds determine a
possible extra transmission cost for C-HTML (although I suspect that
this ratio could be made near or even lower than 1), whereas the
interpretation costs of C-HTML vs HTML would determine a display-time
speedup.  For documents whose cost is dominated by image content
C-HTML would probably make little difference. My concern is with
complex forms for database interaction. Although on paper HTML with
fill-out forms looks like a very promising (albeit not yet fully
adequate) language for doing database front ends, its very slow speed
at transmitting complex forms (about 15 sec for a form containing
about 300 fields, using Mosaic 2.2, NCSA httpd 1.1 on a SPARC IPC,
client and server both on same machine) all but cripples it for that
purpose, since commercial form interpreters can load similar data in a
few seconds, and users expect form interaction to occur at interactive
speeds. At this end of the HTML-application spectrum, at least, the
potential performance improvements that might come with C-HTML would
make a big difference in the usefulness of the Web. Does this strike
any chords?

I guess my point is that I predict there will be very few of the
clients who will need to be upwardly mobile.  When the spec is
released, we hope that client developers will conform to the spec.
Once the existing clients conform, why would anyone write a browser
which is not at least on par with the ones already in use?  When Lynx,
Mosaic, et al are at level 3, who will want to use a level 1 client?
Not many...

Yep.  It's a subtle difference, but I believe it's an important one.
I really believe that the added complexity of "levels" of support
which are all current will turn many developers and users off.  It
stands to make the WWW a lot more complicated than it already is.
However, with a version numbering system, only one version is current
at any one time so there is minimal confusion.

A base definition is definately called for.  "HTML 1.0", for want of a
better name, would ideally encompass most if not all of the current
practices.  I think current practice would make an excellent base for
the standard.

I think the question of ISO Latin-1 character entities in HTML can be

	The following are all equivalent:

	2) &#246;
	3) the-8-bit-code-for-o-with-umlaut-that-my-mailer-refuses

I understand that HTTP is defined as 8-bit clean, but is the same true
of HTML or HTML+? It should be, of course, but I don't think it is in
the DTD. (I may be misreading the <!SGML declaration, though.)

This (the use of mapping tables) would be very nice, especially if a
representation 'string' for a character could consist of more than a single
character, and be adjusted by the user of the browser, such that eg. the
already famous &oumlaut; (shouldn't that be &ouml; by the way?) could be
mapped onto `o"' or `"o' or (for tex people :-) `\"o'.

This would be _very_ nice for characters in the other iso-8859-* sets,
which are currently hopelessly left in the dark -
(as far as i know - but writing this i do recall reading a note from the
 writer of the emacs www browser in which he wrote that it should understand
 (now or r.s.n.) all(?) iso-8859-*(?) entities)
the only 'real' solution i know of is the patch that makes
Mosaic automagically display non-iso-8859-1 pages using the appropriate
fonts, but this solution has the disadvantage of not being in the main
distribution, which means that 'the general Mosaic user' likely won't have
it, which means that the 'trick' implemented by the patch cannot be used
for pages that `Joe random-WWW-browser user' should be able to read.

The charset related discussion i have seen so far mostly focusses on
iso-8859-1; are there standard solutions for the use of non-iso-8859-1
charsets? For some languages, (like Esperanto) the use of entities should/
could be sufficient, but for others i suppose it will be harder.

Wrt the browsers that are/will be able to handle non-iso-8859-1 characters:
do they indicate this in (eg.) some sort of Accept: header?
Or can i just assume that they at least can handle the iso-8859-* entities?
As my non-iso-8859-1 interest is mostly limited to the Esperanto characters
in iso-8859-3, such a header would allow me to adapt my server to return
either a iso-8859-3 document, or an iso-8859-1 with entities for the
Esperanto characters, or an iso-8859-1 document with ascii representations
for the esperanto characters - the latter one would be (and currently is)
the default.

True. The equivalence between (1) and (2) is via the definition
of ouml in the version of the ISOlat1 entity set used in HTML:
	<!ENTITY ouml "&#246;"   -- small o, dieresis or umlaut mark -->

The equivalence between (2) and (3) is via the document character set
in the SGML declaration:

     BASESET   "ISO Registration Number 100//CHARSET
                ECMA-94 Right Part of Latin Alphabet Nr. 1//ESC 2/13 4/1"
     DESCSET   128 32 UNUSED
               160 95 32
               255  1 UNUSED

The intent of the <!SGML declaration for HTML was so say "HTML is
defined in terms of the 8 bit characters set ISOLatin1." I think I
made a couple mistakes in expressing that. For example, sgmls complains
when I use &#255; in an HTML document. I think it's responding correctly
to the 
               255  1 UNUSED
line. I think it should be taken out. But I don't fully grok SGML
character set declarations yet, so I haven't nailed it down fully.

I think the delay you're seeing is not in document transmission, but
rather in the code in the Mosaic HTML widget that lays out the various
fields. It's either in Mosaic HTML widget code, Xt geometry management
code, or OSF Motif widget code.

I think the Mosaic forms implementation is somewhat "quick-and-dirty."
If you're interested in snappy performance for 300-field forms, you've
got to put more engineering into the forms support.

You could do the formatting on the server side, but I doubt that would
be optimal, since the server doesn't know whether it's formatting for
an X display, a Mac, or a vt100. I think this is a client-side issue.

Subject: CommerceNet Launch broadcast over CU-SeeMe
content-length: 2025


	During today (April 12, roughly 8:00 am to 9:00 am PST),
the official launch of CommerceNet will be broadcast over CU-SeeMe,
a Macintosh videoconferencing tool.
	We don't expect to have sound, but a video feed will be provided
during the non-demo portions of the launch to avoid burning up
bandwidth at our end. The launch is taking place at Techmart, a
conference center located in Santa Clara, California, USA.
	The machine doing the broadcasting is one of six machines
on the floor that will be used to demo CommerceNet's World-Wide Web
server, the opening of which will be announced on the www-talk mailing
list and the other normal channels. Other machines have been provided
by Tandem, HP, and DEC.
	You can view the video with the CU-SeeMe software available
at ftp.gated.cornell in /pub/video and hear (should audio be provided)
with the Maven audioconferencing tool. Connect to EIT's reflector
site at 192.100.58.2 for both video and audio.
	Some of the official PR for CommerceNet:
	"Created and operated by a consortium of leading Silicon Valley
organizations, CommerceNet is an electronic marketplace where companies
transact business spontaneously over the Internet."
	"Like the Internet, CommerceNet is open to all users. CommerceNet
users can offer information, goods, and services by creating a multimedia
"storefront" and listing it with the appropriate directories and brokers.
As a fully distributed network of information service providers, CommerceNet's
growth is unbounded; providers run their own network servers and maintain
full local control over their own data."
	For more information on CommerceNet, go to EIT's Web site at

	http://www.eit.com/

	or mail info@commerce.net. Recent articles featuring CommerceNet
have appeared in the _Wall Street Journal_, _San Jose Mercury Times_,
and this week's _Business Week_.
	Enjoy!

using the Back button in Mosaic so that he doesn't see his previous settings.
This might also be useful in that Snails and Slugs game that was on the What's

SIGWEB is an organization started at the end of 1993 to facilitate
communication between practitioners of a field known generally as
Networked Information Delivery and Retrieval (NIDR) within the Bay
Area and surrounding region.  Started by Chris McRae (now at O'Reilly
& Associates - mcrae@ora.com), SIGWEB has quickly expanded to include
participation by several hundred people at its monthly events.  Past
events have included presentations by leaders in the development of
the World Wide Web and its client interfaces, Wide Area Information
Service (WAIS), Internet infrastructure, commercial applications of
the Internet (e.g. CommerceNet), and so on.  All aspects of NIDR, from
technical details and software applications, through standards and
end-user applications are open topics of discussion.  SIGWEB is an all
volunteer run group welcoming participation from all interested
individuals.

This is not necessary, all that is needed is to tell the other end that 
multiple commands are to be sent. Then simply concatenate all the
GET, POST etc messages together.

If every message has a properly declared content-length or other terminator
there is no need to use MIME for this. To me a MIME message only
makes sense in the context of a single message consisting of multiple
parts.

By my reading of MIME each part is allowed to have its own headers, but
NOT its own command. 


Also the content boundaries are in practice much less useful than 
content length encoding since there is no guarantee that a boundary
does not occur in text and no escape mechanism

If you want to get a multipart document then the syntax should be

GET whatever HTTP/1.0
Accept: multipart/mixed

There is no need at all to extend the current specs.  The beauty of this
scheme is that it is not necessary to change any clients or whatever.


A multipart GET only makes sense if the URL refers to a multipart object,
there is no intrinsic difference between a text only fragment,and a
combined text, video, audio collection. 


The only protocol distinction is when the multipart message is a stream
of interactive data. In this case we have a series of MIME segments each
of which must be handled as it arrives. This is the basis for encapsulating
real time video and audio into the web. An interactive HTTP channel is
a HyperTerminal connection.

Well, you would also need to either have the initial command indicate
how many multiple commands are going to be sent, or else have some
kind of terminator so the server knows when to stop listening for
commands.  Of course, similarly, the multipart structure would need a
length header just as all requests with nonempty bodies do, unless you
prohibit epilogues.

> To me a MIME message only
>makes sense in the context of a single message consisting of multiple
>parts.

To me, multiple requests encapsulated into a single request is very
much analogous to multiple messages encapsulated into a single
message, considering how close a request is to a message.  (and
likewise for responses, of course.)

>By my reading of MIME each part is allowed to have its own headers, but
>NOT its own command. 

Um, I'm not sure I know what you mean by this.  We define a MIME type
which is allowed to have a command.  What's the problem?  I think
you're confusing the headers of the body part in the multipart
structure with the headers that are part of the object?

>Also the content boundaries are in practice much less useful than
>content length encoding since there is no guarantee that a boundary
>does not occur in text and no escape mechanism

Sure there is.  The composing software gets to decide what the
boundary is, and presumably can choose something that isn't in the
rest of the message (which it knows.)  It's not like RFC934 where the
boundary string was static and an escape mechanism was needed.  Which
is cleaner is a matter of opinion; I think it's about even either way.

The real distinction here, I think, comes down to two differing
philosophies on the development of HTTP:

a HTTP requests and replies are very similar to MIME messages in most
  respects.  This similarity is no accident, and in general
  functionality which is already defined in MIME should carry over to
  HTTP with minimal change unless there is a very good reason to do
  something else.

  This allows consistency, enhances the degree to which existing
  software can be used to handle both kinds of information, allows
  HTTP to be easily transported along any existing communication
  channel capable of handling mail messages, etc.

  In brief, solutions for which there already exist definitions,
  spec, and software are to be preferred, even if they may seem a bit
  more complex in the short run.

b HTTP uses MIME Content-Types because they are a useful, general
  mechanism for labeling information.  Similarly, HTTP requests and
  responses have headers and bodies because such has proven a useful
  distinction in other contexts and there seemed no point in
  reinventing the wheel.

  However, there's no reason for HTTP to solve other problems the same
  way MIME does unless it's clearly the best way for HTTP to do so.
  For instance, MIME separates multiple parts with boundaries because,
  in general, length headers cannot be used in mail because hostile
  MTAs may perform transformations on messages which change their
  length (though some stubborn UAs attempt to use them anyway.)  But
  HTTP, when used directly, doesn't have that concern and therefore we
  don't need to use that solution.

  In brief, solutions which seem simple and straightforward are to be
  preferred, even if other potentially applicable answers exist.

I tend towards the "a" camp of the above, but can certainly see the
other side (which is what I think I hear Phillip saying.)  What about
other aspects?  How should binding work, for instance?  Is it even
worth bothering to try to ensure that the requests and responses can be
encapsulated and bursted without any modification?

This is reasonable; this would be the way to get a multipart document,
and it is an excellent solution to the problem as you describe it.

However, it is not a solution to the problem being discussed, which
was how to permit multiple transactions with a single server to be
handled as a single transaction so as to reduce the overhead of
setting up and tearing down the connection for each transaction.

>A multipart GET only makes sense if the URL refers to a multipart object,
>there is no intrinsic difference between a text only fragment,and a

The purpose of a multipart GET is to fetch more than one URL at a
time (or, more generally, to POST or HEAD or PUT or whatever method
one likes to various URLs at one time.)  Whether each of these URLs
refers to a multipart object is irrelevant.

>The only protocol distinction is when the multipart message is a stream

Um, that sounds neat, but it sounds quite a step up from what we have
now.  Are there some specs for this or are you just thinking out loud?

Hi all...

  I use the CERN httpd 2.18 beta. And i can't to handle my cgi-scripts
The error report that my NCSA Mosaic 2.4 says is:

What's wrong?

The body script is as follows:

echo Content-type: text/plain
echo

echo CGI/1.0 test script report:
echo

echo argc is $#. argv is "$*".
echo

echo SERVER_SOFTWARE = $SERVER_SOFTWARE
echo SERVER_NAME = $SERVER_NAME

echo REMOTE_USER = $REMOTE_USER
echo CONTENT_TYPE = $CONTENT_TYPE
echo CONTENT_LENGTH = $CONTENT_LENGTH


It's only a sample for my...but don't work...

Of course i add to my httpd.conf the rule 
Exec /cgi-bin/* /local/path/scripts/*

What's my problem?

Thanks in advance, mail to me will be very apreciated....

Subject: Local program exection in WWW browsers
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
content-length: 1021


In order to make full use of WWW browsers I'd like them to execute local
programs, possibly using their output as HTML (ie a local CGI script).  

To do this generally is dangerous as has been mentioned elsewhere.  
However, it should be possible to have Mosaic only execute a program 
link (whether it is a form ACTION or an HREF) if:

1. The page with the link is a local page (since remote pages shouldn't 
   point to local executables)
2. The program to be executed is local
3. The program to be executed is in your PATH (since PATH contains programs
   you already trust).  

In order to tell Mosaic to execute the link instead of reading the file,
an extension could be used (e.g., ".cgi") or possibly a different URL
form could be used (e.g., "exec://localhost/~dheiland/bin/anything").  Some
further distinction may need to be made between those programs that return
HTML (such as a local WAIS search on your private files) and those that don't
(such as click here to run xclock).

Why not just have your local server execute it as a cgi-bin script?

These conditions strike me as both inadequate to ensure security
(especially 3 -- e.g. rm is a trusted program given the right
arguments, but it could still be misused.) and overly restrictive in
terms of the space of possible browser-programs one might want -- 1 &
2 seem contrary to the spirit of the Web. For database applications I
want browser scripts whose main function is to manipulate the internal
state of the browser, since servers do not maintain any kind of
transaction state. 1 & 2 would mean I could not offer up an
application to the Web generally -- each potential user would have to
explicitly download the scripts before they could run my application.
If this guaranteed security it might be worth it, but its hard to see
how it would.

	I think what is needed is a scripting language extension to
HTML that allows programs to manipulate the browser state, including
possibly dynamic restructuring of the displayed documents. Dave Raggett
is including an API for such languages in the HTML+ spec. Security concerns
can be addressed by restricting the operations available in the language --
e.g. no file system manipulations, or only interactively confirmed ones.

Would Telescript or Safe-Tcl be viable candidates as embeddable control
languages in HTML docs? I don't know a lot about these languages, but 
it might save a lot of development time to leverage an existing body
of code if it meets the need.

This reminds me of a thread in the Lotus Notes list a couple of months
ago.  Appears Notes came out of the box defaulted to allow some sort
of Notes Mail to be accepted, containing an embedded macro named "Click
Here".

Doing so, of course, wrought desolation upon the poor PC user.

I tried some searches for safe-tcl (I looked in the TCL FAQ, veronica,
comp.lang.tcl, etc) for some info, as it has been mentioned as a 
possibility.

Can someone "in the know" explain what makes it applicable for a
client-side scripting environment?

By local do you mean on a local web server, or using localhost:// urls? And it 
is possible to have remote pages safely point to local executables, if you do it 
right.

Would need to be unless you set your X display to accept non-local connections.

I disagree with this assumption. Is rm in your path? You trust all local uses to 
use rm in your file area?

That is one way, but you can do it without any extensions being needed. Also 
your suggestion breaks the idea of sending a GET command and getting a response. 
I think you recognise that as a problem yourself.

Here is another way. Define an experimental MIME type, say 
application/trustedlocal. Have some files on your server which map to this type. 
You will need to add a line to mime.types on your server to map file names to 
this type.

Now write an external 'viewer' for this type. You will need to edit your 
.mailcap to map the MIME type to your 'viewer'. The 'viewer' need not create a 
window or anything. It gets a program name to execute as input. It checks this 
against a list of trusted programs to execute. This list also gives an absolute 
path name to the executable and anything else it needs to run, ie the complete 
command which will be executed is known by you in advance when you write the 
list. 

The trustedlocal file can only select from one of these known command lines; 
there is no passing of random strings as parameters. So you cannot hack into 
things like mailx or telnet, for example. 

Seems to me this should do what you want.

I thought the reason for implementing the language extension as an API
is to facilitate using any language as the scripting language...  but
the more I think about this, the confuseder I get.  (Dave -- feel free
to jump in here any time!)  I thought an API specifies a library of functions
that can be called by an application -- but what application? If we
are manipulating the browser state then the application must be the
browser, no?  Which means it must have an interpreter for the
scripting language in it, no? So you are providing both an API and a
hole in which to put a language interpreter, plus a syntax for
embedding scripts in HTML?  If this is the model, my biggest concern
is that by encouraging proliferation of scripting languages you will
be creating a Babel of browser/script-containing-document
incompatibilities.  Better to choose a language: one of the above
mentioned, or others -- a safe subset of perl or emacs lisp are other
possibilities -- any choice will be controversial, but no choice seems
worse!??!

   Well, what if you aren't running a local server, and couldn't talk your
local sysadmins into installing one?  This would be handy for allowing
people to still run searches on local stuff.

    I take it you are referring to this in the htmlplus.dtd?

<!-- Core HTML+ DTD omits following features -->
<!ENTITY % HTML.math "IGNORE">
<!ENTITY % HTML.tables "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % HTML.figures "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % HTML.emph "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % HTML.forms "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % HTML.obsolete "IGNORE">
<!ENTITY % HTML.icons "INCLUDE">

    This does not do _anything_ to any of the browsers' internal state.  A
browser will or will not support figures, period.  It won't ignore them if
someone has a '<!ENTITY % HTML.figures "IGNORE">' in their document.

    This stuff is intended to make the DTD more modular, and was influenced
by the TEI DTD and the discussions in Ireland last november.  So, if I
didn't want to ever use forms, and didn't want to be distracted by their
possible use in an sgml-aware editor, I would just change one of the lines
to be 'ignore' instead of include. 

    If we were to put something like this in the HTML+ dtd:

<!ENTITY % HTML.localexec "IGNORE">

<![ %HTML.localexec [whatever we needed to do to include localexec urls
which is impossible to do, as the URL spec has nothing to do with the
HTML+, but assuming it was possible, it would go here]]>

    This would not affect the browsers at all - only the authoring tools
would 'disable' the use of the localexec flag.  Even then, you would
probably be able to put one in by hand.

    Does anyone still have the URL for the x-exec: url type floating
around, I seem to have lost it.

Because the local server can't apply access permissions as reliably - e.g.,
if I use the local server, it accesses the files as www,www.  If the file
is read only by me, or read-only to a group that I belong, this won't work.
I want to use the built in UNIX permissions and not have to set up special
access files - this is for local access only, not general use over the network.

These languages are indeed candidates, but my primary concern right now
is what functionality is needed, and how to ensure that hostile or buggy
scripts can't harm the client system in any way. This has meant focussing
on the API between the client and script interpreter rather than an early
selection of language. Both Telescript and Safe-Tcl were designed with
different environments in mind, and we need to be creative about our needs
for fill-out forms and later on perhaps, for coordinating different media.
I also feel that the Web deserves a scripting language that makes it
especially easy for novices to get started. Does Telescript or Safe-Tcl
really match up to this?

My sincerest apologies to Ari Luotonen et al at Cern,

In my recent SIGWEB meeting announcement, I mis-attributing the
creation of the Proxy Server.  I'm informed that while Kevin Altis of
Intel did in fact contribute significantly, it was in fact Ari and
company at CERN who created this tool.

We're looking to use Safe-Tcl/Tk scripts in the sense of a
displayable document type, like HTML, or Postscript for
the WWW client we're building.

Safe-Tcl/Tk was originally conceived to support active email.
We'll be adding functionality to allow scripts controlled
access to user's files as well as remote servers.

We'll likely be distributing a Safe wish including our 
extensions which could be used as an external viewer by 
other WWW browsers.

There is a mailing list (safe-tcl-request@cs.utk.edu).

  I tried some searches for safe-tcl (I looked in the TCL FAQ, veronica,

  Can someone "in the know" explain what makes it applicable for a

Try:

The idea is that safe-tcl restricts the language to things that are guaranteed 
to be safe; there's a paper talking about this at some length in the package.

As has been mentioned, a mechanism for doing just that has been
developed and implemented.  See http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/world/exec/intro
for details and patches to your browsers (the lynx patches are out
of date, but the Mosaic for X patches should work even on the newer
versions).

Briefly, it defines a new URL scheme "x-exec" which looks like:

	x-exec://program_name/some_args

It looks to see that "program_name" is allowed by a WWW_EXECPATH
environment variable and if so runs it as a CGI script with
PATH_INFO set to "/some_args", etc.  and displays the output
(which, of course, can be HTML, GIF, or any MIME-typed thing).

Now all you need to do is to patch your browser or convince the
browser writers to make it standard.  Given that the URL working
group has decided that you don't even want to reference local
files, I suspect the best that x-exec: can hope for is de facto
standardization.

to take care of the "security risk" involved in handling application/x-csh

exec on the scripts sent by servers based on client-side user-authorization.

This approach requires users to be security aware, and be able to distinguish 
between buggy and useful scripts however...

Wait, wait, wait...

I think the *HTML* standard can have in it what it's willing to
include in a HREF or IMG SRC=; e.g.,  

in that standard, you can say that you allow

	<A HREF="reference" ...>

where a "reference" is either a:
	URL
	local file designator
	exec link
	relative URL-like-thing

etc.

Not all things that might appear in a *HTML* standard as 'allowable in
a link' should appear in the *URL* standard.

In particular, applications that require *URL*s but can't deal with
'exec links' and other things might be archie-like-things, resource
discovery programs, internet directory services, etc.

Just because it isn't in the URL standard and looks like a URL doesn't
mean you can't standardize it.

Okay, Sorry for mailing this here but I feel the need to vent after what
I have just seen *grin*

For those of you who dont know, the BBC have a new network program
called "The Net" (which is supposedly the ``handle'' for the INTERNET
according to the show :) 

Well anyway it plugged its WWW site (http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/) which to
say the least is of poor quality. The problem is that people are going
to think that this is typical of what the WWW can do, and to say the
least it pissed me off slightly.

Anyway I wrote to the maintainer(s) with a few hints on how to improve
it, but I just feel I needed to vent to a larger audience the BAD work
that the BBC is doing for the Web as a whole.

Which reminds me, according to the BBC the net consists of _just_ the
WWW, email and, get this, BBSs..  Oh and the neo-nazis in Germany. And
who the hell was that guy, "The best known NetSurfer in the UK"?

Finally what I want to know how much did the BBC pay to use the NCSA
MOSAIC logo on various bits of the show? *grin* I only ask that cos if
the BBC can use it in a program then why cant we have it on a T-Shirt :)

Yours, (marginally pissed off cos of the bad name the BBC are giving the
web)

Paul

(p.s. sorry if I offended anyone but its been a long, bad day and Ive
only been here like 3 hours *sigh* - feel free to flame me in private

Wavey Davey!  Oh dear...

Incidentally, if I understood it right the BBC are (via Pipex),
providing dial-up Internet access to the Great British Public
for ca. 5 UKP/month via their "Networking Club"(!)

Not so bad after all? :-)

I was actually interested to see that they went that little bit
further than just reporting on something they're not involved in/
don't understand. But I doub't it will be anyhting major after
the programme cycle finishes.

I sent some comments too, no doubt things will improve as the number 
of suggestions increase.

Yeah, the "BBS" terminology suprised me too, and you are correct in
saying they happily ignored the serious use of the Internet. They said
something like "The main ways of internet access are Demon and CIX,
although CompuServe is linking in too", which may reflect their target
audience, but isn't quite the whole story.

> Oh and the neo-nazis in Germany.

Yawn, well, at least they had somebody saying that it was a lot of
media hype and that there were issue of personal freedom involved.

> And who the hell was that guy, "The best known NetSurfer in the UK"?

Search me :)

> Finally what I want to know how much did the BBC pay to use the NCSA
> MOSAIC logo on various bits of the show? *grin* 

I wondered what they got from CompuServe & CIX for their free
advertising :)

> Yours, (marginally pissed off cos of the bad name the BBC are giving the

Don't overestimate any negative effect of this program. Most people
won't see anything as being wrong; they just see pretty screens and
get a glimpse of what is possible. 

I did miss the lack of information on the Internet itself: it doesn't
help if the general public thinks all that happens on the net is that
hackers look at pictures of dead dinosaurs :/

Hi there,

I am just a user of WWW services via Mosaic2.4 on a SS10 besides my real
work (Software Applications Engineer based in Munich for Automatic Test Equipment
vendor Teradyne).

And I can see blindfolded how powerful this technology is.

All BBC needs to manage is a link to http://white.nosc.mil/info.hmtl
on their wimpy home page. We need no Cabbage on the Internet.
Do you think they know how to set that up?

Cheers,

Adrian

in your own country for that matter.

Bad?  In this half-hour show, the Internet has already received more (and
better) attention than ever before on TV.  Remember that the programme is
not targeted towards the average www-talk subscriber.

And they *did* solicit comments, so things are likely to change for the
better in the coming episodes.

I was a bit surprised when they showed

and saw Eric Bina's e-mail address float past.  ;-)

Hmm... I see what you mean, doesn't sound _too_ bad though!

  The Bulletin Board System (BBS) has been supplied by specialised software
  developers based in London. It runs on Sun SPARC clones and is connected to
  the PIPEX network backbone by a 1 Megabit/ps leased line. Club members will
  be able to connect to the BBS initially through a standard Zmodem protocol.
  If they then wish to connect to the Internet they will be able to download
  TCP/IP software from the BBS to run on their own computers. Having
  downloaded the TCP/IP stack they can then connect to the Internet or the
  BBS as they wish. IP address allocation will be dynamic in order to
  conserve IP addresses. Passwords will be supplied to Club members when they
  join the BBCNC.

  E-mail will be possible from the BBS. In addition, freeware and shareware
  software for other Internet activities such as ftp, telnet, gopher, WWW
  searches will also be available from the BBS software archive.

And not forgetting...

  Why does the BBS go members only on 11th May? That's the day we begin
  offering Internet access to the public in the UK. We are creating special
  software for the PC, Apple Macintosh and Acorn Archimedes which will
  provide a graphical interface for the Bulletin Board. This will be
  included in our starter kit, along with a manual and copy of the Club's
  newsletter.

  If people in the UK decide to join the Club, this starter kit will cost
  #25.00 for the PC and Mac packages, and #35.00 for the Acorn. New members
  will then be given a password, and will pay #12.00 per month with no
  additional on-line charges.  All prices quoted here are exclusive of the
  British sales tax, VAT, which is currently 17.5%.

  By dialing in to new points of presence around the country, members will
  be able to connect initially to the BBS. To connect to the Internet,
  members will be able to review help information on-line and download the
  relevant software, including TCP/IP stacks. 

(OK, 12 quid a month! :-)

$ So yeah, okay a bit of good might prevail. Im still worried about the
$ attitude that they are giving about the WWW :) 

Agreed - hopefully they will do an in-depth feature on the Web later,
and square things up a bit.  I'll e-mail them now and suggest it!

Ciao,

Martin

Well, this is being chewed over on the local campus newsgroups.  I videoed
the show with the intention of making the sound track and maybe the video
available on campus via the WWW (apparently our agreements with the BBC
let us do this for everything bar the Open University programmes). 
However, it was so content free and full of mis-information I'm not going
to waste my time with it.  Even the slightly computer literate people on
campus said they found it boring (as did technophobic spouses/partners). 
Their own email address was wrong, and the HTTP URL was missing a trailing
slash.  Not a promising start (especially seeing as they've been working
on it full time since January).

Probably someone big on CIX or CompuServe that none of the rest of us have
ever heard of.  Why didn't they get someone who we know and who knows
what they're talking about such as TBL or MarcA?

I daren't think what could happen if someone shows the production crew the
MBONE.  :-)

During a recent course on Internet, we made demonstrations of WWW and
Gopher. Although the course participants liked the idea of the services,
their appreciation would have been higher if so many things which looked 
to them like errors in the data bases occurred.

What happended was that when I tried to follow a link, instead of getting 
the linked document, I got either nothing, or some kind of error message
saying for example that "this file has been moved to tape" or something
like that.

Because the person who puts in a link in WWW or Gopher, and the person 
who is responsible for the linked document, sometimes are not actively
cooperating, this can happen. Especially when users use services like
Veronica, links to non-existing documents can easily occur and make
people feel that Veronica is not a good service.

My suggestion for a solution to this problem is the following:
Change the format of WWW and Gopher documents, so that there is a bit 
somewhere in the document saying that "this is a dummy document,
the real document is not available any more". Also, always store
in WWW and Gopher documents the e-mail address of the person responsible 
for the document. By document I mean also Gopher menus.

Then create a program which runs through the whole worldwide Gopher and 
WWW data bases, in much the same way as is done when accumulating data 
for the Veronica data bases. This program should note every case where a 
Gopher menu or a WWW document contains a link to a non-existent or dummy 
document. The program should then automatically write an e-mail message 
to the person responsible for the WWW document or Gopher menu, telling 
him/her that his document/menu contains links to a certain non-
existent or dummy document. Hopefully, the person will then remove the 
non-working link, or change it to refer to an existing document instead.

(I am not a subscriber to www-talk or gopher-news, so if you write an 
answer to this message, please post a copy to my e-mail address also.)

It seems exec-ing local cgi programs is easiest if Mosaic (lynx?):

1. Reads the stdout of all external viewers and treats it as CGI output
2. Sends to the stdin of external viewers the results of the POST method
3. Doesn't copy local files to temporary files when invoking viewers - saves
   a split second and the viewer gets the actual path name of the local file.

This takes care of specific programs (e.g., now your gif "viewer" can return
html with an embedded <img> so xv/lview isn't needed, etc.).

To handle arbitrary programs, simply map files ending in ".cgi" or whatever
to application/x-cgi, then map that to "execsafeprog %s", as shown in NCSA's
executing shell scripts.  #3 above gives you the ability to check that the
program is local and is in WWW_EXECPATH (which you set in your .profile).

If #3 isn't done, the .cgi file could contain the name of a program to run.
Note that #2 is needed to support local form processing.  To avoid problems
with output from viewers, Mosaic could treat application/x-cgi as special.
Providing arguments could be done with file.cgi?-arg, etc.

I proposed this a while ago, which covers a lot of the issues,
but did not see to much response. 

Mosaic Accessories

External viewers

Currently, add-on functionality to the Mosaic viewer is accomplished
by means of external viewers. A viewer is a leaf process which is
invoked by Mosaic to accomplish a particular "add-on" function. Once
invoked the viewer operates autonomously, with no further connection
to Mosaic. The external viewer mechanism has proven to be a very
useful technique for extending Mosaic. In particular, for adding the
ability to view mpeg, jpeg, and audio files.

Problem statement

Although the external viewer mechanism is very powerful, there are
still are things that one cannot do: 

   News Browsers: A full function news browser needs to have
   history file. The history file would then be used to prune the
   article list (typically a UL list) to hide what one has already seen.
   Additionally, one would like to be able to have kill files, search
   functions, reply and post functions, etc.

   Mail Tools: While browsing a mail archive, one would like to be
   able to invoke standard mail tool functions. For example, after
   selecting a mail message one should be able to reply, forward,
   delete, file or print that article. 

   Form entry: HTML+ supports form entry. However, currently
   all forms must be filled out manually. I frequently find myself
   filling in standard info (name, e-mail address, mailing address,
   etc.) Would it not be nice to be able to create "forms" that fetch
   directly from files? This would certainly assist those who would
   like to have forms where one entry item is a request for a 100KB
   file.

   Mosaic editors: The ideal Mosaic editor should work
   symbionically with the Mosaic viewer. Allowing one to edit
   HTML while simultaneously seeing it in the viewer. 

Problem Analysis 

Today, if one wants to extend the Mosaic client one has two choices. 

 1. External Viewers: However, a viewer, when invoked, operates
   completely asynchronously with Mosaic. Furthermore, it
   operates in complete isolation from what the Mosaic viewer is
   doing.

 2. Edit Mosaic: That is, modify the source code for Mosaic.
   However, this is something that people shy away from doing.
   Either because they don't know how, or given the pace of
   releases from NCSA, they might be afraid of trying to keep their
   edits current. 

Outline of Proposal

I would like to suggest a simple modification of the viewer mechanism,
so that we could have a tool in-between the two above mentioned
extreme choices. That is, I am proposing something I call Accessories. 

An Accessory can be thought of as a variant of an external viewer,
however it operates symbionically and simultaneously with the main
Mosaic client. Furthermore, there is a communication channel between
the accessory and Mosaic so that changes and updates can be sent
between the Mosaic client and its accessories (e.g. the HTML editor).

Examples of Current Accessories

Actually, Mosaic already implements the rudiments of an accessory
construct. For example, the Document Source Viewer, can be thought
of as a symbiotic accessory. Whenever the viewer changes location, so
does the Document Source Viewer. However, the source viewer is: 

 1. An integral piece of the Mosaic Viewer. 
 2. Does not have the necessary reverse communications channels
   that a real HTML editor or Mail tool would need. 

Other current (but even more rudimentary) examples of accessories
are: the Open Document Pop-Up, the HotList Viewer, and the
Binary-Save dialog box. 

Related Work

The concept of an Accessory should also be familiar to people who
work with TK/TCL and to a lessor degree those who work with
Microsoft Windows Applets. In these systems one migrates small
constrained interactive functions to accessory applications. For
example, interactive drawing tools, chart tools, debuggers, paint tools,
etc. are implemented as Applets or TK tools that operate in tandem
with the main applications.

Maintaining a communication channel between application components
is an important part of both of these systems. With Applets, one uses
OLE to invoke and communicate information, while in TK/TCL one
uses the send mechanism (via the X11 property lists, or in TCL-DP via
TCP/IP). 

This model of software, where compound applications are fabricated
out of a flock of inter-communicating sub-application tools, is also
becoming in vogue in the CORBA community. 

Proposed Implementation

 Feel free to write me with alternative suggestions. I view this
 proposed implementation as very tentative.

Invocation of Accessories

Applications can be thought of as client side CGI scripts. Thus a
rudimentary way of implementing accessory invocation would be: 

   <A AREF=accessory.ext>Generic Accessory</A> 

However, one would prefer not to specify an actual file, but rather a
MIME type which would then be mapped via the .mailcap file to the
accessory. This would allow one to create documents that specify a
generic type of accessory, and allow the user (via the .mailcap) to
choose the version of the accessory that he/she wishes:

   <A AREF=accessory/x-html-editor>HTML Editor</A> 

The .mailcap entry for this could be: 

   accessory/x-html-editor HTML-ED.exe 

Sometimes one will want the user to manually invoke the accessory.
However, in other cases, for example a news reader, one would like to
have the accessories pop up automatically on certain pages. This could
be done by: 

   <A AREF=accessory/x-news-responder
   MODE=immediate></A> 

One would also like to place some accessories (e.g. the current
document viewer, mail-to, hotlist accessory, print, etc. ) on the Mosaic
menu bar. This could be done via x-resources (as is now done for the
old DOCUMENTS pull-down menu). Perhaps a better solution would
be to create an .appcap file whose entries would be used to create a 
Applications pull-down menu for the Mosaic menu-bar. Entries in the
.appcap file would be of the form: 

   accessory/x-html-editor HTML Editor...
   accessory/x-hotlist Hotlist Accessory... 

Communications to/from Mosaic

Accessories are meant to operate in tandem with the Mosaic viewer.
Minimally, this means that accessories need to know what is currently
showing in the Mosaic viewer. They also need to be able to tell the
Mosaic viewer to switch to a new document. For example, the HTML
editor accessory receives the HTML document from Mosaic, and can
return the updated version of that document.

Communications with Mosaic is very similar to the CGI interface. That
is, there is a small header followed by a MIME type. For example:

   Location: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/index.html
   Content-type: text/html

   --- HTML DOCUMENT --- 

where --- HTML DOCUMENT --- would be the HTML code for
the current document being displayed in the Mosaic viewer. 

It is the job of the accessory to parse the HTML code. For most
accessories this will be trivial. For example, a news accessory just has
to parse a <UL> list of news articles - a very easy task. Most
CGI/WWW programmers are already pretty competent in PERL, TCL,
AWK, C-shell, or C, and there are fairly good tools in most of these
languages for scanning HTML and parsing it. I would expect these to
be the prime candidate languages for writing accessories.

CGI scripts, however, are meant to run once and return. This is not the
case with accessories. They should run in tandem with the Mosaic
viewer - and receive a new message-packet each time the Mosaic
viewer changes. Thus, we cannot use command line arguments or
environment variables. Instead communication occurs via standard
input and output. The actual format of a message-packet is therefore:

   Location: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/index.html
   Length: xxxx
   Content-type: text/html

   --- HTML DOCUMENT --- 

The accessory uses the Location argument to tell when the viewer has
switched to a new document. It can either update itself, or tear itself
down if it is no longer relevant. The Length argument tells the
accessory the length of the body (the HTML document). 

The accessory communicates back to the Mosaic viewer in a similar
manner:

   Location: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/index.html
   Length: xxxx
   Content-type: text/html

   --- HTML DOCUMENT --- 

If the Length, Content-type, and body are left off, then the
message-packet is a standard remote-control directive - telling the
Mosaic viewer to GET to a new document. Otherwise, the Mosaic
viewer is to attempt to execute an HTTP PUT directive and replace the
HTML document.

Some accessories may not need the full HTML document, but instead
could get by with just a list of parameters. Other accessories might
want both start-up parameters and an HTML document. Parameters
could be passed in the body of the HTML document using SGML
comments. However, I believe the following is a cleaner way to handle
parameters: 

   <A AREF=accessory/x-mailer
   ARGS="arg1=34&arg2=test"></A> 

The accessory will then receive the following message-packet:

   Location: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/index.html
   Length: xxxx
   Arguments: arg1=34&arg2=test
   Content-type: text/html

   --- HTML DOCUMENT --- 

where the arguments are URL-encoded.

External Communications

Accessories are free to talk to a variety of external ports. These could
include:

   files, e.g. a news diary, a mail alias file, hotlist file. 
   external TCP-IP ports 
   infrared hand held remote device. 
   links to a pager. 
   Closed caption feed from a TV station. 
   links to a packet cellular or cellular phone (CPDP) link. 

For example, one can create a two-way pager remote accessory (or
more likely a PDA such as the Apple Newton). Then one could in
effect, run Mosaic on one's pager, by having the accessory talk to the
pager. The accessory would be responsible for the translation of pager
events and request into Mosaic requests. Personal information (diaries
of news articles read, signatures, security codes, etc.) could be kept on
the PDA and accessed by the accessory to fill in forms or weed out
previously read news articles.

Another idea for PDA accessories would be a personal database
accessory. This database would contain information about what one
had already browsed on the net, personal filtering agents, information
about expense accounts, personal telephone directories, etc. Then, as
one moves from site to site and workstation to workstation, one could
plug this information into the local Mosaic Viewer in order to
personalize it.

In general this is the idea behind these client side accessories. That we
should be able to extend the Mosaic client to provide wider access to
Mosaic and to make it work in better harmony with other tools on our
hosts.

Communication Issues

The use of standard input/output for communications is less than
perfect. One problem is that it is a stream protocol. Which requires us to
either mark packet boundaries, or to give packet counts. Also, there is
no good channel for signaling events. However, packet protocols such
as TCP, UDP, or RPC are really not meant for such application
protocols. In the long run, I think we should be moving both the CGI
interface and the Accessory interface to one of the emerging
applications protocols. That is, either CORBA, OLE or perhaps a hybrid
multi-protocol interface. In any case, the final choice should be based
on it being widely used across platforms and suitable for both LAN and
WAN applications communications.

I have deliberately skirted the synchronization issue. That is, what
happens when there are multiple accessories all attempting to re-direct
the same Mosaic viewer. For the moment, I think we can allow such
race conditions to exist - since most accessories are meant to be
controlled by a single live user via their user interface. However, I
would like to hear the viewpoint of others.

Security Issues

Accessories are meant solve a security problem. One could implement
accessories today, with no changes in the Mosaic client, by means of
client code viewers. For example, a PERL viewer could be loaded with
arbitrary PERL code from a HTML document, and execute accessory
functions on demand. However, this would open up a door to trojan
horse code being uploaded to the client machine and running without
the users knowledge or awareness.

The Accessory mechanism gives the user the ability to: 

   Choose which accessories to use (those he trusts). 
   De-Virus and verify accessories before use. 
   Supply substitute secure accessories of his own creation. 

Implementation Issues

Implementation of accessories seems to be a fairly straight forward and
simple modification of the current viewer mechanism. There is also the
issue of modifying the Anchor directive. However, it does not seem that
it would take a lot of work. I would certainly have gone ahead and
modified Mosaic myself. However, there are issues here that I think the
entire WWW community should be discussing. Furthermore, I would
want anything that is done to become part of the base-line Mosaic
system rather than just a personal variant Mosaic viewer.

Summary of Advantages

Allow OEM'ing of Mosaic GUI tools. 
   Currently tools such as the Document Viewer, Hotlist Viewer,
   Mailer, and Document Saver are all integral parts of Mosaic.
   NCSA staff has to be devoted to maintain these tools as well as
   write new ones such as the HTML editor. The Accessory
   mechanism will allow third party development of these tools.
   Leading to wider customer choice and faster development time. 
Stop Kvetching! 
   NCSA staff is frequently asked to make certain changes to the
   Hotlist viewer, Mailing tool etc. By providing an easy customer
   modifiable mechanism we can give the end user the ability to
   create his own variants of these tools. Only basic PERL, AWK,
   or C-shell script writing skills will be needed. 
Consolidate functionality 
   The accessory mechanism consolidates current tools such as
   the Document viewer, new tools such as the HTML editor, and
   old mechanisms such as the Remote control feature, into one
   unified simple mechanism. 
Remote communications 
   There is an upcoming explosion of personal mobile physical
   accessories. For example, two-way pagers and PDA's such as
   the Apple Newton. The accessory mechanism is a quick way to
   give a subset of Mosaic/WWW access to these devices. 
Database access 
   Accessories allows one to have personal or external databases.
   The accessory can then use these databases to provide
   automatic form filling out, and filtering of mail or of news. 
Security 
   Currently extending the client involves loading code into a code
   viewer (e.g. a PERL or CSH viewer). There are big security
   problems with this approach. The accessory mechanism gives
   one a more secure means of extending a client. 

Future Directions

Ultimately, one could imagine the Mosaic Viewer itself being
re-implemented as an accessory. Mosaic then would become an
background daemon process. This daemon process would act as a
master conductor, informing its accessories when a new document was
switched to, and arbitrating between the responses of the various
accessories. I believe this is the way that TkWWW now works. In such
a scheme we would have effectively OEM'ed the entire Mosaic
interface.

Yesterday, I posted to these e-mail addresses a question about NCSA Mosaic 2.4
and x86 Solaris 2.1 related to an undefined symbol at final link time.  The
message below from Guy Harris (thanks, again, Guy) explains the situation in
very clear terms, so rather than trying to paraphrase and summarize, I'm just
forwarding it.  I was able to successfully build version 2.4 by explicitly
linking to the X11R5 libXmu rather than to the OpenWindows libXmu.
================

The "editres" stuff was added in X11R5.

The X11R4 "-lXmu" doesn't have "_XEditResCheckMessages"; it first showed
up in X11R5.

Now, the way "gui.c" figures out whether to use the "editres" stuff is
that it looks at "XtSpecificationRelease" and, if it's greater than 4,
it uses it.

I'd *expect* that to cause it *not* to try to use the "editres" stuff
in an X11R4-based system, so either:

	1) the OpenWindows component of the Solaris 2.x system in
	   question is X11R4 based, you've dropped X11R5 onto your
	   Solaris 2.x system, but you are, when building Mosaic, a
	   mixed bag of Openwindows 3.x and X11R5 stuff (e.g., you're
	   using header files from X11R5, so that "gui.c" is built with
	   "editres" support, but are using libraries from OpenWindows,
	   so that "-lXmu" doesn't have "_XEditResCheckMessages()");

	2) you're building entirely with the OpenWindows X11 stuff, but
	   the OpenWindows component of the Solaris 2.x system in
	   question is botched, so that its header file says it's X11R5,
	   and "gui.c" thus uses the "editres" stuff, but its "-lXmu"
	   lacks the "editres" stuff;

	3) something else.

If the answer is 1), try building *entirely* with the X11R5 stuff; that
means you need to make sure it's linking with the X11R5 "-lXmu", not
with the OpenWindows one.

If the answer is 2), then:

	1) complain to Sun;

	2) let the NCSA people supporting Mosaic know about this
	   problem;

	3) try tweaking "src/gui.c" so that, at least under the version
	   of Solaris 2.x you're using, it doesn't define
	   EDITRES_SUPPORT (dunno how to identify that version; the
	   broadbrush technique they used to work around a similar bug
	   with HP-UX probably isn't appropriate, as other Solaris 2.x
	   versions may not have that problem, and even versions that do
	   may not have it if you use the MIT X11R5 libraries - the
	   broadbrush technique isn't even appropriate for HP-UX, for
	   that reason...).

If the answer is 3), you're on your own.

(The reason this worked with older Mosaics is that they had a bug wherein
they were checking "XtSpecificationRlease" or some misspelled variable
name such as that, and thus never tried using the "editres" stuff.)

We have already implemented techniques to connect X Mosaic to arbitrary
external applications to handle data types not directly supported by
Mosaic and have that presentation incorporated directly into the Mosaic
output window (with all the synchronization that implies).

If NCSA is willing to open Mosaic to external application developers via
a well-defined API and the WWW community is willing to support the
extension of HTML(+) to incorporate SGML external entities and
sub-documents, I think there is the potential of implementing a true
compound document browser.

However, without NCSA's and the WWW community's support, there is very
little hope.

Jacob,

	I totally agree; plus, instead of giving a message like you 	
	sometimes get from a phone company, for example:

	"Sorry you must NOT dial a "1" in front of this number..."
	Why not just assume "no 1" and not bother with the message.

	In the case of "this xxx relocated to yyy," why not just
	link to "yyy" instead of bothering with the message, or, 
	notify with the message and still link them there.

This is my sense of the situation also. But I like to put a more
positive and optimistic spin on things.

Currently, Mosaic has become the sin-quo-non for WWW clients. It
has done such a good job at hiding the details of the web, gopher,
news, etc that a lot of high level mangagement and Buisness Week
writers only refer to Mosaic, and leave out mention of the WWW.

Ok, so that means there is tremendous pressure on NCSA to act
as the gatekeeper for client upgrades. Yes, they did not ask
for this role, but that is how it is developing.

There are techniques, ala Fresco and TK, for "seemlessly" folding
in active components into a WWW client. I see tremendous pressure
being taken off of NCSA, and a explosion of seemlessly added
features to the client - if we can only agree on a API for
allowing compound document inclusion into the Mosaic (and other
WWW clients). 

It is definitely a win-win scenario.

This message is to announce the availability of Multi-Localization
Enhancement of NCSA Mosaic for X 2.4 (Mosaic-L10N-2.4.0).

This Multi-Localization Enhancement makes use of various national
character sets in NCSA Mosaic for X 2.4.  You can switch between
character sets in one Mosaic.  Currently supported character sets
are for Czech, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Turkish, Chinese, Korean,
Japanese and more... 

For more information, please check out

    <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/Mosaic-l10n/">

and both source level patch and binarie distributions are available
via anonymous FTP at:

    <A HREF="ftp://www.ntt.jp/networking/WWW/Mosaic-l10n">

I've also just made a new mailing list for exchanging information
around multilingual capability of World-Wide Web.  If you would like
to join us, please mail to

    www-mling-request@square.ntt.jp

--------
And I must apologize to many people for not replying E-mail about
question or comment for this multilocalization of Mosaic, because of
pressure of work and mix-up related to my visiting abroad. Sorry...

Because you need to get the subscribers to stop dialing the 1 so 
that at a later date you can use numbers beginning "1" that don't 
conflict

again, if people don't have to change it themselves,they won't!
Then if a link became reactivated but with completely different info
it could cause LOTS of confusion and you might not be able to find
the correct link again.  And you may think the chances of using the 
same url is unlikely?  Well, given the nameing conventions I've seen
it's quite likely!  (eg. /www/me/1.html /www/me/2.html etc....)

and I suggest, Jacob, if you want to continue listening to 
discussion on this, that you start receiving the group

  Jacob,
  
  	I totally agree; plus, instead of giving a message like you 	
  	sometimes get from a phone company, for example:
  
  	"Sorry you must NOT dial a "1" in front of this number..."
  	Why not just assume "no 1" and not bother with the message.
  
  	In the case of "this xxx relocated to yyy," why not just
  	link to "yyy" instead of bothering with the message, or, 
  	notify with the message and still link them there.
  
The analogy is a good one, because in both cases the answer is user training, 
either because some future change will make what the user did mean something 
different that she probably doesn't want, or so the resources used to do the 
transfer (the old phone number or URL) can eventually be reused.

 I have started a rudimentary quality-checking program for veronica.
 We are trying sites and files at random ...  this is rather crude yet
 because we don't have a way to distinguish bad data except the Bummer
 msgs and "can't connect" msgs.  I think some sort of marker like Jacob's
 could be quite helpful.

Well, prehaps we should have never showed the BBC the WWWvia Mosiac at
the last Comnet/Livenet conference/trade show in DC... :)

They had their camera's there and did a whole news clip on it, interviewing
a fellow from the International Internet Association. They also wanted to
interview me in my red tied died shirt as I was demo'ing Mosaic and the WWW
about 2 paces away, but I bulked. I hate TV (even painted a picture called
"smash your tv!") and could not imagine being on a broadcast as such. 
Luckly, the fellow I was working for stepped in and did the interview and
I went to play with my MBone connection... :)

I recon they showed this clip in Britain...

Bert Bos wrote me the following letter. I think it
illustrates some of the issues that I am raising.

] It is good that you raised the issue again. Since you first proposed
] the Accessories, I've been thinking about them and drawing sketches of
] possible implementations. It is a complex matter, which might explain
] at least partially why there is little direct dicussion of your
] points. For a project that I'm working on I need something that is
] very closely related:
] 
] a) controlling the graphic user interface:
] 
]    1) I like to be able to use external programs to decode and display
]       documents that the main browser cannot handle, but I like the
]       output of the external viewer to appear *in the browser's
]       window* even if the output is not HTML. This applies, e.g., to
]       images in other formats than GIF, sounds, animations, editors,
]       telnet-sessions.
] 

This is much along the lines of Mark Litton's work on FRESCO. 
See the X technical conference proceedings. (A Taste of FRESCO)
which should be part of the X11R6 release.

He has been working on this for several years, and has working
models.

Much of this model will also be part of the TK4.0 release. 

]    2) Different documents need different interaction tools. E.g., when
]       an MPEG movie is played, there should be a play/pause/stop
]       control, when a sound is played, there should be volume control.
]       These would be a extra buttons or a menu, that must also appear
]       in the main browser window.
] 

Yes, we are thinking along simliar lines here. I am looking forward to
the time of Mosaic being available in a ubiqutous computing environment.

That is, one can run it on a PDA. While the display metaphor might
be able to run intact on such a device, one might well have very
different sorts of interactors. That is, I might find the interactors
of the current FORMS mechanism very clumsy on a PDA. I might one
real physical sliders or controls on the PDA to map to the FORMS
input. 

]    3) Like you proposed, some accessories should be available at all
]       times, from an applications menu that is specified as a
]       resource.
] 
] b) controlling the functionality:
] 
]    1) Some functions of the browser have to be disabled for certain
]       documents (i.e., accessories): one cannot `save' a
]       telnet-session or `view the source' of a sound.
] 
]    2) Some other functions should be added when an external viewer is
]       running, like the play/stop and volume controls.
] 
] So far I haven't been able to come up with a single protocol that
] would allow all different external viewers to work. Some external
] programs are simple enough that they can be run as a filter,
] converting a document to a known format, such as HTML or GIF. Others
] need to interact with the user and will have to communicate with the
] main browser in a two-way protocol that should at least do the
] following:
] 
] - add to the hotlist
] - remove from the hotlist
] - retrieve the hotlist
] - add to the global history
] - retrieve from the global history
] - change the displayed document without adding a new URL to the history
] - stop the accessory
] - disable some functions of the main browser
] - direct the browser to get a certain document
] 

I have put the actual implementation of this work on hold until
FRESCO or TK4.0 comes out. At that time, I would see the creation
of a new WWW client as the desired methdology.

That is, all that would be left of the old Mosaic viewer would
be an HTML-viewer object. The window of this object would be mapped
into a larger composite tool. Interactor objects (pull-down lists,
VCR controls, etc) would map in and out of this compound display
on demand, depending on the document viewed. Different
sorts of interactors would map in depending on the terminal (Workstation,
notebook, PDA, beeper) that one was using.

I would like to see the FORMS interface completely broken out of HTML.
This was proposed in www-talk by Dan Conally, and he was really yelled
at about it. 

But I liked it. That way the HTML viewer object would not be the dependent
on interactors at all. 

Instead there would be a different HTML DID for forms. In some cases
a FORMS viewer object would be created and mapped to the display as
it is now. In other cases the Forms might be mapped directly to hardware.
E.g. physical sliders, virtual reality interfaces, etc. 

Thus one would have a constellation of small acessorry applications.
each one implementing a particular task: HTML viewer, FORMS accessory,
etc.

Underlying all of this would be an orchestration agent. It would be a
non-visible piece of software.

Its main jobs would be to:

o fetch URI's 
o coordinate shared resouces between accessories (incuding the HTML viewer)
	- image cache
	- etc.
o provide signaling functions to the accessories
o provide messaging services to the accessories
o other coordination functions
 	- e.g. tearing down accessories on exit



] And in my case I also need a way to have to have to X programs
] cooperate in a single window: one program would own the window, the
] other would own the parent and they should be resized together.
] 
] Do you have specific ideas about possible protocols? You mentioned
] CORBA, but all I know about CORBA is that it is quite complex :-(
] The CGI-type interface may be alright for accessories that simply
] translate a document to HTML or to a URL reference, but it seems
] rather cumbersome for the interactive accessories.
] 
] There is probably also a link with the client-side scripting language
] that Dave Raggett has been telling about, but I'm not sure exactly
] how.

Well, I guess it was good that I *didn't* show them the MBone, afterall. :)

Of course, Interop is going to have a MBone connection in Los Vegas so
I  know it's going to get alot more publicity.

We found the MBone quite fun. I love playing tic tac toe on the white board
and drawing faces... :)  And We also were able to see an IETF meeting that
was happening in Europe.

Cool stuff... :)

I can give one reason for giving the relocation message -- you may be 
trying to migrate a server from one location to another.  In that 
instance, you'll want to leave up notices of the change for a while (long 
enough for people to fix their pointers), but you don't want to leave up 
the old server permanently.  After all, what's the point of moving the 
server if you've still got the old server giving out redirections?  :)

Jacob and Dennis ARE RIGHT. It is annoying to stumble around and get stuck
on so many broken links. But it's very time consuming to maintain large
webs, particularly when they are so volatile. We are all experiencing
phenomenal growth in use of the web, and one of the beauties of the web is
that it is SO EASY to get a few pages going. It's not surprising there are
tons of broken links out there. Not only are many of the people browsing
the web NOT webmasters, but many are quite new to computers as well! I say
all this interest can only help the cause, and we should welcome them. WE
provide a service and ought to be helping these people, not slapping them
around for making mistakes!

But Piglet is right too! The user has to re-learn the new location. Perhaps
an intermediate station would offer the best result. What I've done with
our interally (and eternally!) changing webs is to put an alert at the old
URL, and provide a message and a temporary link for a period of time, then
eventually do away with the old. (BTW, that's how the phone company handles
new area codes here as well--first they work right or wrong, then a warning
and you have to redial, then you're just SOL.)

>And you may think the chances of using the 
>same url is unlikely?  Well, given the nameing conventions I've seen
>it's quite likely!  (eg. /www/me/1.html /www/me/2.html etc....)
Again, let's give the newcomers assistance instead of thumbing our noses.

>and I suggest, Jacob, if you want to continue listening to

Not everyone is interested in receiving the quantity of email a group like
this involves. Is it such a burden to cc his name to your correspondence? I
hope you're just having a bad day! :-/

Good Point!

But, does it have to go all the way to the server?  
I wonder if there could be an updated index rather than 
physical address.

I'm looking for a converter that will take a big single GNU texinfo
file, and produce a big single HTML file from it, preserving all the
link pointers and such.  Anyone have such a beast?  I've tried a couple
of info2html converters that I've found on the Web, one from Germany,
one from Ohio State, but they both seem to be intended to be used as
servers that do lazy conversion -- not at all what I need.  Note that
texinfo is valid TeX, but is not LaTeX.

You cat get the utilities from ftp.sunet.se:/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar, but if
you download the ncsa binaries from us (/pub/www/Mosaic) the following is 
applicable.

Compressed and gzipped files (i e files ending with .Z and .gz or .z)
can be decompressed respectively gunzipped before retrieval by
excluding .Z, .gz or .z from the filename in the get command. For
example, the file foo.tar.Z can be uncompressed before retrieval by
the command 'get foo.tar'. You may also compress or gzip any
uncompressed file by adding .Z or .gz to the filename. It is also
possible to tar and eventually compress or gzip a directory structure
by adding .tar, .tar.Z or .tar.gz to the directory-name.

Once again, technology to the rescue :)

Howbout a program which, given a local html file, recurses through
links on that file to other files, and the base case on the recursion
is a link to a file on another machine.  When it reaches this, it
sends out a HEAD command, and if the file exists it moves on, but if
it gets sent back a REDIRECT header, it finds this new document, and
reports back to the web maintainer on the local machine that his link
to "x" is wrong and needs to be changed to "x'".  If the script were
robust enough, this could be set up to do interactively, or even
automatically.  Thus the conundrum of moving pages or whole sites
could work.

I know there are scripts out there that do the first part - checking
links - so adding the functionality to automatically change incorrect
links might be a good thing.  Or, it could be as dangerous as the
speller in MS Word 5. :)

Speaking of giving the Net (equating with the Web, sorry! :) a bad name,
I finally got a glimpse of Ted Nelson on the box last night. The
Australian Channel Seven talk show 'Denton' had an interview with the
illustrious inventor of the term 'hypertext'. What did they talk about...
'dildonics' - erotic I/O devices.... umm

Needless to say, his spiel on Xanadu was pretty unconvincing as well.

This is an option that should be on all browser menus, especially
desktop ones.  I am always wanting to build Real World documents from
stuff on the net (especially manuals) and this would be a great help.

Any chance of the code making it in, if I write it?

This sounds like a reasonable approach, and I'm glad to see it
happening.  It seems like this is only half of what is needed, though.
Presumably we want this interpreter to be able to interact with the
WWW client after it is running.  Offhand, I can think of at least two
new commands you would want the untrusted interpreter; one to send the
client a URL and have it go to and display it, and one to send a MIME
message (which may be a part of a multipart structure the program was
enclosed in, or HTML built on the fly, or whatever) to the client to
be displayed as though it were sent by a server.

Unfortunately this means defining a way to tell clients to do this.
Obviously implementing this for TkWWW will be trivial, but most
clients don't have any provision for this kind of stuff (and those
that do often implement it poorly.)  Either that or embed the
interpreters in the client itself, which is unlikely to happen soon.

XMosaic does have a hack whereby you place a URL in a file, then
send it a signal. It's a bit primitive (you can't tell if it fails
or when it's loaded the thing) but it's a start.

Of course, the logical conclusion of all this is something in the
direction of the WWW client composed of a number of interoperating
parts, as described by Yechezkal-Shimon Gutfreund.

@ "smash your tv!") and could not imagine being on a broadcast as such. 
@ Luckly, the fellow I was working for stepped in and did the interview and
@ I went to play with my MBone connection... :)
@ 
@ I recon they showed this clip in Britain...

Nope, they had this guy from CIX (ya know, him of the body art), playing
with MacMosaic :)

BTW, anyone had any replies from the BBCNC yet? Or did we fill their

Hi all...

 I want to download a copy of Mosaic for Windows from NCSA, but this 
machine is alway overloaded and is very dificult.
 Somebody known a mirror site with wmos20a4.zip from NCSA?

I think that is a good idea to perform a mirror site to avoid the 
overload of zaphod.ncsa.uiuc.edu

Thanks in advance...

I see nothing in this that is especially NCSA Mosaic specific, although the tome 
of it suggests that the author is thinking exclusively in terms of NCSA Mosaic 
for X.

Could I sugest that the few remaining places where X resources and so on are 
mentioned be revised ( alternatives are given anyway) so it applies to all 
versions of Mosaic; and further that it be made a general interface so that an 
applet written to the spec will also work with other conforming browsers on 
whatever platform?

I feel this would then become a very valuable proposal which I suspect would be 
supported by browser implementors as it would reduce the burden on them from 
feature requests.

>Mosaic Accessories

Would probably be better if this were generic enough that all clients
could use it.   Actually, since we're talking about commuication
between applications, it may not be portable to MS-Windows or Macs but
at least we can make it UNIX portable.

I guess I'd see this as an area where the existing news: URLs could
work OK, but news browsers need some mechanism for having another
program tell them to go someplace.

Ah, so many approaches to choose from... presumably what has to happen
is that someone picks one of them and implements "standard" and
(hopefully) portable stubs for both the browser and the accessory,
maybe smart enough to use something ICCCM based where available and
pipes or sockets otherwise, or something like that.  There will be
lots of accessories and lots of browsers, and the details of which
talk to which how need to be abstracted out.

I guess I don't get what exactly would be in the file "accessory.ext"
that would be of type "accessory/x-html-editor".  More abstractly, I
don't see how anything except the program itself can be an object of
that type.  Though there should be consistent names for these if
things are done this way, I don't really think MIME content-types are
suited to this.  What would it mean if I mailed you a message with
this content-type?  What would go in the body?

Anyway, generally I like the paradigm; it's somewhat bigger than the
discussion of client-side programmatic languages like Safe-Tcl (a
safe-tcl interpreter, running server-provided code, would be one
potentially very flexible accessory.)

A valuable suggestion, but an ambitious one. When I think of
interprocess communication I cannot help but think in terms of Unix
concepts (or X). To abstract away from that and still come up with
something that works efficiently everywhere will be difficult.

Nevertheless, I am going to give it a try (I was going to, anyway),
based on the idea of a protocol that alternates commands and
responses, of variable length up to a certain maximum, and with room
for later adding new commands that won't break older versions.

It's probably too early to attempt a universal solution, but if there
is interest, I'd be happy to occasionally report on my progress.

So, who suggests the first batch of things that a `WWW control center'
and an accessory would want to exchange?

Another suggestion for keeping links in the Web up to date:  How about a 
cooperative system?

The document at the end of any URL could optionally supply a pointer to a 
notification server.

When someone creates a link to the document, he could mail the server a 
notification request in a form similar to:

    !NOTIFICATION REQUEST:  URL-UPDATE    <URL>       <address>
                                ^           ^             ^
                              Request    Current     Who to Notify
                               Type        URL      when it changes

It is assumed that whoever maintains the document can update the notification 
server.  When a document moves, the notification server mails all the addresses 
who want URL-UPDATE notifications a message like:

    !NOTIFICATION:  URL-UPDATE   <URL>          <URL>
                                   ^              ^
                              Previous URL     New URL

Upon receiving notification, the receiver updates all of his documents to 
reflect the change.

The advantage of such a system is that nobody has to waste time and bandwidth 
testing all of their links, most of which would be just fine.  Also, nobody is 
_required_ to implement anything, and nobody gets sent anything they don't ask 
for.

As the number of notification servers and receivers increases, Web documents 
would become silently, transparently, more reliable.

The concept here is that I want a mapping from the reference of
the accessory (which the creator of the HTML document is specifying)
to the the actual accessory, which the client-user prefers.

That is, HTML document authors would indicate a generic accessory.
I do not want him to be able to provide explicit references to
a particular accessory. (e.g. George Phillip's solution). Instead
I want to specify a type of accessory, and specify the explicit
binding in the .mailcap file.

However, I do hear your point about mailing a message with this content-type.

This will be different for each platform, but for 
X-based browsers the selection mechanism might be 
a good approach.  The XHelp protocol is a good 
example of how this could work.

There are some disadvantages, though: only one 
browser could be "active" at a time (the owner
of the 'WWW' selection), and it might not be easily
implementable in Tcl/Tk without interpreter extensions
(at least the last time I checked, Tk didn't support
the full X selection mechanism, only PRIMARY selections.)

I wish the various list processors had an option where every mail
message sent out with them would contain a header:

	x-subscription-messages-to: listserv@info.cern.ch

or something. Maybe even make it a standard header instead of an x-
one. 


Obligatory www-talk discussion:

There are still a number of issues around 'mailto:' references:

a) I'd like a URI for 'mail retrieval' which contains the actual text
of the mail to be sent (for mail robots, listserv archives), and which
is different than the 'mailto:' kind of URL which identifies a person.

b) why is it 'mailto:person@host.dom' but not
'readnewsfrom:alt.test' and 'postnewsto:alt.test' vs. 'news:alt.test'.
Could it just be 'email:person@host.dom', since the 'resource' is the
mailbox, and not whether the mail is to it or from it? 

Should the 'From: ....' field in HTTP be a URL instead of a mail
address?

Here's something that's been brewing in my mind for a couple years now.
It's still fairly rough, but it hangs together, and I'd like to see it
form a basis for disussing things like URNs and such:

A Formalism for Internet Information References

ABSTRACT
========

This is a mathematical model for references between typical
information objects in the internet community; specifically, the model
covers the URL concept from the World Wide Web application and the
external body mechanism from MIME.

I suggest that this model be used to define the requirements for
specifications of new URL schemes and MIME access types, and that it
provides basis for other extensible reference mechanisms such as the
URN and URC mechanisms as variously proposed in the URI working group.

INTRODUCTION
============

We begin with definitions of some commonly used notions:

The set of octets, or bytes:

	Octet = { 0, 1, 2, ..., 255 }

Strings, sequences, or streams of bytes:

	Using the notation SEQ{S}, short for
		{ seq | for some N, seq : {0, 1, 2, ... N}  -> S }
	OctetStream = SEQ{Octet}

Then we formalize some of the MIME notions:

	ContentType = { text/plain, application/octet-stream, ... }
		/* just a finite set. Properties or the elements,
		aside from identity, are not defined */

	Entity = ContentType x OctetStream

And finally, we begin with a function to model the resolution of
references between entities in terms of an as-yet undefined set of
References:

	Resolve : Reference -> Entity

While in general, internet resources are do not all fit the definition
of Entity (telnet servers, ftp directories, etc.), the information
units transferred between information clients and servers generally
do. Thus we begin by discussing references to entites, and we define
references to other sorts of resources in terms of the basic Resolve
function.

For example, the basic model of computation for a WWW client goes:

	1. Given some reference r0, compute e0 := Resolve(r0)
	by sending r0 to the server and getting e0 back.
	2. Present e0
	3. Let the user choose a reference r1 from e0
		(click on an anchor, select a number, drag-select
		a range of text, enter some search words, etc.)
	4. Compute e1 := Resolve(r1) as above
	5. Iterate steps 2 thru 4


THE BASIC WEB "GLOBAL FILESYSTEM" REFERENCE
===========================================

The WWW reference mechnism, the URL, is a generalization of a
filesystem pathname.

	Dirs <: SEQ{OctetStream} /* <: meaning subset */
	File <: OctetStream

A normal filesystem pathname doesn't satisfy the properties of a
reference for several reasons: The pathname "x/y/z" may reference
different entities depending on the "current directory" of the client
process. So the relation:

	Dirs x Filename x Entity

is not a function. This can be addressed by using full pathnames. But
the path "/etc/motd" references different entities on different hosts.
So the WWW application adds hostname information to the path to make
it globally unique.

	Host <: OctetStream /* internet host names */

But even "local-file://host/dir/file" can reference different entities
at different times. But if we include a time argument

	Time = { real numbers } /* time in seconds since start of
				C.E. calendar, written here in
				ISO time format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ.
				For the purposes of this discussion,
				a one second clock resolution is
				assumed to be sufficient */

then we have a well defined function:

	LOCAL-FILE.GET : (Host x Dirs x File) x Time -> OctetStream

Many filesystems don't associate an explicit ContentType with every
file. But we assume that the following function is well-defined:

	Resolve.LOCAL-FILE : Host x Dirs x File x Time -> Entity

For example, we can require that the content type be part of the
reference, or we can use heuristics guided by the filename. So with a
content type ct in hand, we have

	Resolve.LOCAL-FILE(h, d, f, t) = (ct, LOCAL-FILE.GET((h, d, f), t))

Or with a content type heuristic

	InferType : File -> ContentType

we can have

	Resolve.LOCAL-FILE(h, d, f, t)
		= (InferType(f), LOCAL-FILE.GET((h, d, f), t))

The local-file: access type shares semantics so far with the anon-ftp:
access type. In general, the ftp RETR operation can be modelled as:

	User <: OctetStream
	Account <: OctetStream u { {} } /* account is optional */

	FTP.GET : (Host x User x Account x Dirs x File) x Time -> OctetStream

Note 1: we don't consider the password, since the retrieved entity does not
vary as a function of the password

Note 2: we don't deal with type ASCII versus IMAGE transfers here
either. I don't think has significant impact on the model, but @@ I
need to think about it some more...

The anon-ftp: access type is a simplification of FTP that obviates the
User and Account parameters:

	ANON-FTP.GET : (Host x Dirs x File) x Time -> OctetStream
where
	ANON-FTP.GET((h, d, f), t) = FTP.GET((h, "anonymous", {}, d, f), t)

And gopher is similar:

	Port = { 0, 1, 2, ... ,65535 } /* IP port number */
	Selector = SEQ{Octet - { 9, 13 }} /* no tabs or newlines allowed */
	Search <: OctetStream u { {} } /* @@ what subset? */
	GType < ContentType /* Gopher types: subset of MIME types */

	GOPHER.GET : (Host x Port x Selector) x Time -> OctetStream

	Resolve.GOPHER : Host x Port x Selector x Search x GType x Time
		 -> Entity
where
	Resolve.GOPHER(h, p, sel, ser, gt, t) =
		(gt, GOPHER.GET((h, p, sel, ser), t))

The HTTP 0.9 model is nearly identical to gopher:

	Path = SEQ{ { 33 .. 126 } } /* no whitespace or 8-bit chars */
	HTTP0.GET : (Host x Port x Path x Search) x Time -> OctetStream
	Resolve.HTTP0 : Host x Port x Path x Search x Time -> Entity
where
	Resolve.HTTP0(h, p, path, ser, t)
		= (text/html, HTTP0.GET((h, p, path, ser), Time))

The HTTP 1.0 model is significantly more complex. We'll get to that
later. But in general, for a set Location* and a set Context*, if there
are functions g and t and a set s where:

	g : Location* x Context* -> OctetStream
	t : Location* x Context* -> ContentType
and
	For all c in Context* and l in Location*,
	Resolve((s, l, c)) = (t(l, c), g(l, c))

then we say that g is a GET function for Context* and Location*, t is
a TYPE function for them, and s is a SCHEME for them.

So far we have that LOCAL-FILE.GET is the GET function for Context* =
Time and Location* = Host x Dirs x File, ANON-FTP.GET is a GET function
for the same set -- hence the need for the distinguishing scheme.

We now have some subsets of the set of References. If s is a SCHEME
for a set Context* and a set Location*, with corresponding GET* and
TYPE* functions, then

	For all c in Context*, l in Location*
	(s, l, c) is an element of Reference.
since
	Resolve((s, l, c)) =  (TYPE*(l, c), GET*(l, c))

Here we define several current URL schemes in this manner, and I
suggest that in order to introduce a new URL scheme, we required a
definitions its Location and Context sets along with definitions of
GET and TYPE functions.

LOCAL-FILE:
	/* defined somewhat informally, as this is defined in terms
	of the local host */
	SCHEME = "local-file"	(a string is an OctetStream, which is a set)
	Location = Host x Dirs x File
	Context = Time x (ContentType u { {} })
	GET((h, d, f)) given informally:
		FILE *fp = fopen(path(d,f)); fread(fp...);
	TYPE((h, d, f), (t, ct)) := if ct = {}, InferType(f)
					else ct


FTP:
	SCHEME = "ftp"
	Location = Host x User x Account x Dirs x File
	Context = Time x (ContentType u { {} })
	GET((h, u, a, d, f)) as per FTP RFC:
		CONNECT h
		USER u; PASSWD ...
		Account a  /* unless a is {} */
		CWD d1
		CWD d2	/*@@ how many CWDs? */
		...
		RETR f	/*@@ type i/a command? */

	TYPE((h, u, a, d, f), (t, ct)) := if ct = {}, InferType(f)
					else ct
	
ANON-FTP:
	SCHEME = "anon-ftp" /* @@ sometimes written ftp */
	Location = Host x Dirs x File
	Context = Time x (ContentType u { {} })
	GET((h, d, f)) as per FTP RFC:
		CONNECT h
		USER anonymous; PASSWD <client's email address>
		CWD d1
		CWD d2	/*@@ how many CWDs? */
		...
		RETR f	/*@@ type i/a command? */

	TYPE((h, d, f), (t, ct)) := if ct = {}, InferType(f)
					else ct

GOPHER:
	SCHEME = "gopher"
	Location = Host x Port x GType x Selector x Search
	Context = Time
	GET((h, p, gt, sel, ser)) as per Gopher Protocol:
		telnet h:p
		if ser = {}, send sel
		else send sel<tab>ser

	TYPE((h, p, gt, sel, ser), t) = gt /* @@ other type mechansims? */

HTTP:
	SCHEME = "http"
	Location = Host x Port x Dirs x File x Search
	Accept = { f | f : ContentType -> Real }
	Context = Time x Accept
	GET((h, p, d, f, s), (t, a)) and
	TYPE((h, p, d, f, s), (t, a)) in terms of HTTP GET operation:

RELIABILITY ISSUES WITH FILE (AKA MUTABLE OCTET-STREAM OBJECT) REFERENCES
=========================================================================

The following problem of references to mutable objects is sharted by
several schemes: Suppose an author discovers a file at 1pm and
constructs an HREF to that file; then, the file is modified at 2pm,
and finally a reader resolves the reference at 3pm: the entity the
reader sees is different from what the author saw. That is,

	GET(loc, tread) != GET(loc, tauthor)
and hence
	Resolve(loc, tread) != Resolve(loc, tauthor)

But in many cases, the author and the reader _can_ read the file at
different times and get the same result. How can we determine if this
is the case?

One way is to use the time of last modification of the file. We can
model this as a function lastmod satisfying:

	lastmod : Location* x Time -> Time
where
	For all l in Location*, t1, t2 in Time
	If t1 >= lastmod(l, t2)
	then GET*(t2)(l) = GET*(t1)(l)

Where GET* is a GET function for Location and Time.  We'll call such a
function a LASTMOD function for the set Location* and the function
GET*.

Note 1: I don't believe the FTP RFC specifies how to determine the
time of last modification, but it can be determined reliably in many
cases. @@ I need to look into this...)

Note 2: I don't believe Gopher specifies a way to determine the time
of last modification. Perhaps Gopher+ does.

Then, in the above example, we have the following:

	If tauthor >= LASTMOD(loc, tread)
	Then GET(loc, tread) = GET(loc, tauthor)
and hence
	Resolve((s, loc, tread)) = Resolve((s, loc, tauthor))

That is, if the reader can determine that the file hasn't changed
since the link was made, s/he can have confidence in the integrity of
the link. If the mod time is later, the client software can warn the
reader before transferring the possibly erroneous data.

So one way to enhance the typical HREF="local-file://host/dir/file" to
be a well-defined Reference is to determine the time context of the
reference.  This can ben done in any of several ways:

	1. Enhance local-file URLs to contain time info; e.g. the author
	writes:

		local-file://host/dir/file;time=19940414141000Z

	2. Enhance the HTML A element to contain time info; e.g.:

		<A HREF="local-file://host/dir/file" TIME="19940414141000Z">

	3. If the reference is in a file whose modification time is known,
	we can make the heuristic assumption that all the references
	in the file were current as of the last modification of the
	file.

Either of the first two is tedious for hand-edited documents. But they
are simple to implement in any cut-n-paste or "paste link" feature.
They also work nicely to fill in the missing content type.

	<A HREF="ftp://host/dir/file;user=connolly;account=general"
		date="19940414141000Z"
		content-type="application/postscript">

The third option is more convenient, though less robust. Consider:

	1pm: file Y written with info on apples
	2pm: file X says "see file Y for more on apples"
	3pm: file Y modified to have info on oranged rather than apples
	4pm: file X modified, but still says "see Y for apples"
	5pm: reader of X cannot detect (by machine) that
		the link to Y is corrupt.

Also: references get copied and pasted, quoted, etc. The time context
of the reference should travel with the reference.

Another technique for detecting faults in resolving references is to
include the MD5 signature of the entity in the reference. This
mechanism is somewhat expensive: it only detects faults _after_
transmission of the octet stream, and it requires computation
proportional to the length of the entity.

A much less reliable technique is to include the octet count of the
entity in the reference. The FTP RFC includes a mechanism to detect
this type of fault before transmission of the entity. (i.e. you can
ask an FTP server how big a file is before you transfer it.)


STRING REPRESENTATIONS OF REFERENCES
====================================

The string representation of a reference is an important part of the
specification of various applications. But it is not clear that we
need one string representation for all applications. It is much more
critical that we understand the properties of the objects we are
trying to represent. Once we have a definition of the set of object
we're representing, we can choose various means to represent the set
in various contexts, with well-defined mappings between syntaxes, for
example, between W3's HREF="xxx" and MIME's external-body; access-type="xxx" 
syntaxes.

A definition of a scheme syntax may include incomplete string
representations, as long as it discusses mechanisms and/or heuristics
to determine the remaining parts of a well-defined reference.

LOCAL-FILE:
	string rep((h, d, f), (t, ct)) given in perl as
		&file_uri("local-file", $h, *d, $f, $t, $ct)
		where d is a list of the directories
		and t is in ISO time format

sub file_rep{
    local($scheme, $host, *dirs, $file, $time, $content_type) = @_;

    if(@dirs){ $sep = "/"; }

	$ret .= ";as-of=" . $time; # @# better name for as-of?
    }
    if($content_type){
	$ret .= ";content-type=" . &uri_escape($content_type);
    }

    return $ret;
}

sub uri_escape{
	local($_) = @_;
	s-[/?=;:]-sprintf("%%%02X", ord($&))-ge; # list of illegal chars?

FTP:
	string rep((h, u, a, d, f), (t, ct)) given in perl as
		&file_uri("ftp", "$u@$h", *d, $f, $t, $ct) # @@ account?
		where d is a list of the directories
		and t is in ISO time format
	NOTE: the string representation is often written without the
	time and content-type information. In those cases, the content
	type should be inferred from the filename and the time should
	be inferred from the context of the reference.

ANON-FTP:
	string rep((h, d, f), (t, ct)) given in perl as

		where d is a list of the directories t in ISO time format
	NOTE 1: the string representation is often written without the
	time. In these cases, the time should be inferred from

	NOTE 2: the string representation can only represent a limited
	form of the content type metric function, i.e. "type x is
	best," and ofthen it is ommitted completely. In those cases,
	the client should encode a content type metric function based
	on its capabilities and the user preferences.

RELATIVE NAMES
==============

Essentially (@@ need more discussion), if we have

	Resolve(r0) = e0

and a name n is found inside e0, we apply the function

	Relative : Name x Reference -> Reference

and compute

	Resolve(Relative(n, r0))

compute Resolve(r0), it can, for example, give the whole r0
reference to a proxy server s, ala:

	Resolve(r0) = Resolve((proxy, (s, r0)))

and so the question becomes: is Resolve(r0) in the cache?

In order to do mirroring, we need techniques to distribute information
about circumstances where a client can substitute references, i.e.
where
	Resoleve(r') = Resolve(r)
but r' is easier to get to.

This is where heirarchical namespaces come in: we'd like to distribute
information of the form:

	For all *,
	Resolve("ftp://host1/dir1/*") = Resolve("ftp://host2/dir2/*")


LOCATION-INDEPENDENT REFERENCES (URN's)
=======================================

Rather than:

	Resolve : Scheme x Location x Context -> Entity

we might as well write:

	Resolve : Scheme x Name x Context -> Entity

for example we can define:

	RFC.GET : Name x ContentType -> OctetStream
	RFC.FILENAME : Name x ContentType -> File
as
	RFC.FILENAME(n, c) = "n.txt" if c is text/plain,
				"n.ps" if c is application/postscript
	For all time t /* since rfc's don't change */
	RFC.GET(n, c) = ANON-FTP.GET(("ds.internic.net", "/pub/rfc",
					RFC.FILENAME(n, c)), t)


FUTURE DISCUSSION
=================

@@ security, scalability, reliability (fault detection and tolerance,
caching, migration, compression, encryption, authentication)

I built an HTML->MIF converter a long time ago. It's probably somewhat
out of date by now, but it worked well at the time. And this is not the
www_and_frame version: this is just a few hundred lines of ANSI C
code. It wouldn't be much trouble to update it and add an RTF writing
module.

See ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/dev/libHTML-930121.tar.Z

Here's my current version of the README for that package:
(this version is probably not in the tar file on info.cern.ch)

README for HTML design code/ideas as of Feb 1993.

This is just a collection of stuff I used to develop
the HTML spec.

Included are translators:
        from            to
        plaintext       html    
        html            mif
        plaintext       mif

and perhaps some others.

I was working on an extesible, object-oriented architecture
for dealing with SGML documents and MIME bodies.

This thread is just too nice a coincidence.  I will be presenting a paper
at the WWW94 conference on exactly that type of tool, although with a much
more robust design and efficient operation.  The program is called the
Multi-Owner Maintenance spider (MOMspider).  

The paper (or at least most of it) can now be read at:

    http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/MOMspider/WWW94/paper.html

I would very much appreciate any comments.  The missing bits of the paper
(the one figure and appendices) will be added tomorrow, so there's no need
to tell me about that -- I'd do it now, but I can barely see straight after
working all night.

Well since Daniel has made something available, I will too. A while ago, I
wrote some stuff for inclusion in my thesis (which will not be included
now) relating to formalising the Web. I have collected the stuff into an
article and have made it available at:

I would like to stress that I have made sizeable (sometimes wild)
assumptions in parts of this work. This work is not finished and is
likely to contain inaccuracies. 


I'd still like to hear feedback.

The new httpd 1.2 from ncsa has changed the handling of
server side includes. 
In my opinion this is unwanted extra elements to html. the reasoning is
as follows:
1) server side includes are only activated for files with some file
   extension.
   This is a realy good idea! It save many cpu cycles. it even recognizes
   certain files eg having specified the 'extension' as index.html the
   deamon tries to do server side includes for every file ending in
   'index.html' . I'm not sure if this was the intended behaviour, but it
   is good for me.
2) the include syntax is weird. The idea of using comments for it is the one
   I think is unnesseccary and unwanted. what's wrong with a element
   of <include "ape.html"> Nothing it seems to me. every browser is
   expected to ignore it when not recognized (in case it does and up
   in the client, without being included(this was the argument to use
   the comment element for it)).
   Also the include could be handle by either the client or the server
   (ofcourse you want to include it by the server, but it's the fact
   that one can use the same syntax for it... <include "some url"> could
   be a file from any machine, but could be included by the server before
   sending it to the client if it so happens that the file is located
   on the same server *and* the file extension matches the one defined
   under (1)).

I really don't want to stress this to much (the harm being done already), but
please keep don't keep adding definitions of new elements or pseudo
elements (hidden in a comment) were other elements can serve the same purpose

Please don't flame me with html editors will do it for you. (they won't for me)

How would embedded, active objects -- such as viewers for inlined 3D  
objects -- work in this accessory scheme?

The communication protocol I've seen proposed so far is basically set  
up to allow a single accessory to manipulate the HTML document as a  
whole.  But in the case of active, embedded objects, this would  
appear to lead to a "cooperative multi-accessorizing" nightmare.  I'd  
prefer to have the protocol based on something like distributed  
object interfaces.

Also, the proposed protocol enforces a focus on the browser's  
currently displayed document.  That's not appropriate for embedded  
objects, which need to stay attached to the document which contains  
them (for as long as the browser wants to "cache" the active  
accessory).

Really?  That would be great, but I think you are exaggerating.

For example, as far as I know, none of the "alternative" browsers  
implement ANY of the provisions for interactive graphical input  
specified by the standards --  a fundamental limitation.  There are  
at least 3 to choose from:

HTML DTD 1.8:
    -- INPUTs of type "image" (equivalent to HTML+ "submit")

HTML+ DTD draft 21 Mar 1994:
    -- INPUTs of type "submit" with a SRC attribute
    -- INPUTs of type "scribble"
 

I am certainly glad to see your enthusiasm for the standards, and  
look forward to continued improvements in compliance.

   Has this yet been 'adopted' as a new 'standard' of HTML?  As far as I am
aware, HTML was frozen quite a while ago and people were told to focus on
HTML+, which they have been.  The HTML 1.8 DTD is a hybrid between HTML and
HTML+, which is a bad idea I think.

   If the 'image' input type is put into the HTML+ spec, I will put it in
my browser.  Until then, I will work for using 'scribble'.

b> HTML+ DTD draft 21 Mar 1994:

   5 minutes work. tick... tock... done.

b> -- INPUTs of type "scribble"

   Just waiting for the support to pass events through an emacs window to a
subwindow I can loan to a suitably advanced helper application.   It will
be extremely easy to move to the 'conglomeration' of small apps approach
that was recently suggested.  Just added support for scribble using a
helper application.  Input of type 'audio' is just as trivial to add.

   HTML+ conformance yes, new 'standards' that people are still arguing
about, nope.

Hello,

At Lund's University Library, Sweden and National Technological Library
of Denmark, we have build a "WAIS/WWW integration". This is basically
two things, 

1) a subject tree of WAIS databases.

and

2) a CGI program for searching multiple WAIS sources.

We provide a pilot service that can be seen and tested at
http://www.ub2.lu.se/auto_new/UDC.html.

Further information is found on the same page.

Comments are welcome.

/*
 * server side include  by frans van hoesel
 *    written on Apr 17,  4:01pm.
 *
 * The new httpd 1.2 from ncsa has changed the handling of
 * server side includes. 
 * In my opinion this is unwanted extra elements to html. 

NO! NOT HTML! See below.

 * the reasoning is
 * as follows:
 * 1) server side includes are only activated for files with some file
 *    extension.
 *    This is a realy good idea! It save many cpu cycles. it even recognizes
 *    certain files eg having specified the 'extension' as index.html the
 *    deamon tries to do server side includes for every file ending in
 *    'index.html' . I'm not sure if this was the intended behaviour, but it
 *    is good for me.

This is the intended behavior. There is a far more important distinction
being made here than you may realize. You are telling the server that
certain files are of a special format, text/x-server-parsed-html. This is an
internal representation that IS NOT HTML. It is similar to HTML, and
translates into HTML, but it is not HTML.

 * 2) the include syntax is weird. The idea of using comments for it is the one
 *    I think is unnesseccary and unwanted. what's wrong with a element
 *    of <include "ape.html"> Nothing it seems to me. every browser is
 *    expected to ignore it when not recognized (in case it does and up
 *    in the client, without being included(this was the argument to use
 *    the comment element for it)).

What about the element INCLUDE on the client side that may (or hopefully
not) appear in the future? FLASTMOD with a URL? 

You are also now requiring every HTML DTD to have special cases for things
that no browser should ever see. There is no reason to use HTML like tags.
The reason that the activation characters happen to be those that surround
SGML comments is so that in the event that this internal representation
should fall into external parsing hands, the extra directives will be
ignored without conflicting with existing HTML tags that may have the same
name.

 *    Also the include could be handle by either the client or the server
 *    (ofcourse you want to include it by the server, but it's the fact
 *    that one can use the same syntax for it... <include "some url"> could
 *    be a file from any machine, but could be included by the server before
 *    sending it to the client if it so happens that the file is located
 *    on the same server *and* the file extension matches the one defined
 *    under (1)).
 
This is fine for file includes but file includes are but one feature among
many that can't be done on the client side. Further, I would argue that
making sure that the ape.html referenced on the server is the same as the
ape.html referenced by the client expanding an include is far too difficult.
 
 * I really don't want to stress this to much (the harm being done already),
 * but please keep don't keep adding definitions of new elements or pseudo
 * elements (hidden in a comment) were other elements can serve the same
 * purpose

Again, I don't see what this has to do with HTML.

 * Please don't flame me with html editors will do it for you. 
 * (they won't for me)
 */

No flame, I'm just trying to clear things up a bit. HTML editors will do it
for some later on, all they have to do is insert an HTML comment which
happens to have significance to the server.

On the levels issue, the only levels I am interested in are :-

level0	HTML
level1	HTML+
level2	HTML+ MATHs

The Maths extensions are a lot of work to implement and the only browser to
implement them implements very little else. But they are absolutely essential
if we are ever going to publish papers on the web as anlternative to 
paying sums to get journals to publish papers then buying back the finished
product, doing all the work en-route for free making huge profits for
various publishing houses (eg that of Bob `anyone for a swim' Maxwell).

So I can see that putting maths into another level would be a good idea.


What I would prefer though would be to have HTML-1.0 HTML-2.0 HTML-2.1. 
whoever though up the + ? Adding +s to things is in my view like some tacky
hollywood production JAWS2 or whatever, except that version 13
of HTML will look silly HTML++++++++++++++++....... :-)


Before that happens I think that people will have to go to full SGML or
at least a configuration file which is what mine uses. SGML fans might like
to note that a DTD is useless for doing this :-(

I don't know if the level idea is useful or not, but what I had in mind is that
once "Minimal HTML" ( = level0 HTML) is defined, implementors can build things
like HTML->text translators (for mail gateways?), linemode browsers, and minimal
functionality tools like that. Then folks can validate (using the Minimal HTML DTD)
that their docs will work with such tools.

Similarly, we could take what Mosaic 2.2 (or 2.4?) implements, find a suitable
DTD (close to the 1.8 version I sent out), and call that level1. And so on...
If there are various "markets" for HTML documents, then we need various HTML
levels. On the other hand, if all the authors need the same features, and all
the implementations support them equally well, then there's no need for various
"levels."

[This raises the question: what do level0 browsers do with level1 docs?
I hate the "ignore tags you don't recognize" idea. But it may be the
only way to go...]

Do we expect to be able to do interactive typesetting of mathematics? Pretty
ambitious. If I were tackling the problem of integrating math into WWW, I'd
be working on the "multiple MIME types in one data stream" problem, and use
LaTeX some such for creating/editing math, and then develop tools to typeset
LaTeX into encapsulated postscript, CGM, Windows MetaFile, Mac PICT format
and the like (along with support for bitmap formats, since X doesn't support
any MacDraw style graphics formats)

A DTD is useless for doing what? Expressing various levels and availability
of various features? Check out

http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-test/html.dtd
$Id: html.dtd,v 1.8 1994/04/09 01:02:10 connolly Exp $

for a counterexample. Right now, I can validate that a document uses
	* only "standard" features (read: features I like)
	* only Mosaic-supported features

 (credit for the idea of using "feature test entities"
goes to Dave Raggett, who got it from the TEI folks)

Some time ago I wrote some lines on how to support not only local
but also remote clients. The bottom line is to treat applications
available on the Internet similar to documents and thus access them
via a to-be-defined URI.  Embedding graphical applications inside
graphical WWW browsers can be done in principle, at least for X11
with the new Fresco toolkit available with the now very soon to be
released X11R6. However, security is still an issue to think about
heavily.

My suggestions are available as
<http://www.informatik.uni-dortmund.de//WWW/GeneralGateways.html>. 
Perhaps I'll get some feedback from you?

Hopefully it will! You can already include images - why not text

Subject: Advertising info services via the DNS
content-length: 1315

Hi, 

You may be familiar with the technique used by Netfind to locate white
pages services - by looking up TXT records in the DNS.  If not, see
ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/cs/distribs/netfind/Netfind.WP.URLs

I think this technique might be useful as a generic method for
advertising services, i.e. by putting the "official" URL for a service
into (say) the DNS entry for the server which provides it.  This info
may then easily be harvested by resource discovery systems.

Registering your service only requires the addition of a single line to
your DNS configuration, e.g.

  www             IN      CNAME   lust.mrrl.lut.ac.uk.
  lust            IN      A       158.125.220.7
                  IN      TXT     http://www.mrrl.lut.ac.uk/

and...

  # nslookup
  Default Server:  avarice.mrrl.lut.ac.uk
  Address:  158.125.220.8

  > set type=txt
  > www.mrrl.lut.ac.uk
  Server:  avarice.mrrl.lut.ac.uk
  Address:  158.125.220.8

  www.mrrl.lut.ac.uk      canonical name = lust.mrrl.lut.ac.uk
  lust.mrrl.lut.ac.uk     text = "http://www.mrrl.lut.ac.uk/"

There is scope for putting some more info in here, e.g. brief
description of server, admin contact, whether robots are
allowed/encouraged, ...  I think this is the province of the info
server, rather than the DNS

OK, what do you think of it so far?

Hi again,

Quick question. Can someone either point me at or preferably tell me in
like 2 lines what the common log file format now is... I have:

site.domain - - [dd/MM/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +/-XXXX] "GET <URI>" SSS ???
	    ^ ^                                               ^^^

	    +-+------- What are these 3? I cant remember! ----+++

(Oh, XXXX is the offset from UST right? and SSS is the HTTP status code,
(200, 302, 40x etc)?)

Thanks,

Paul

In the last few days I have read over carefully the comments
of Bert Bos, Paul Burchard, and David Martin. It
appears that there is some convergence of opinion
here - and hopefully we can exploit it.

Let me try and wrap things up (as seen from my perspective):

Background:

o Several groups have been working on client side excutable code:
  examples include the George Phillips exec:// hack and safe-tcl.

o Some of us feel that we would prefer a more systematic extention
  to the WWW client - one that specifies a clear division of responsibilites
  between accessories and host client - coupled with a well specified
  communications protocol

o I have, in the past, proposed an extention to the Mosaic client that
  was along these lines. I chose Mosaic, mainly because it was
  a single clear reference point. Obviously, I was aware that what
  I was doing had general applicability to all WWW clients. 

  I used that paper to try and discuss all ramifications that I could
  see, and to analyze several radically different classess of accessory
  tools.

  I do not consider myself a prophet, and I am quite cognizant that
  given any architecture that I proposed, it would be limited by
  the scope and breadth of the classes of accessorory tools I
  could envisage. 

  Therefore, I opened things up to try and get more input.

  I tried to make my architectural additions incremental to the
  current Mosaic, so that NCSA would "bite the bait".

Current state of Affairs:

o NCSA does not seem interested. 

o We seem to have a core group who is interested, and would like
  to put together a blue-print of a new architecture for WWW clients.
  Perhaps getting this into the standards bodies or before the IETF?

Where to go Next:

o It looks like it is time for Plan II: scrap incremental changes
  to the current set of WWW-clients, and go with a new plan.

I suggested this at the end of my paper:

Future Directions

Ultimately, one could imagine the Mosaic Viewer itself being
re-implemented as an accessory. Mosaic then would become an
background daemon process. This daemon process would act as a
master conductor, informing its accessories when a new document was
switched to, and arbitrating between the responses of the various
accessories. I believe this is the way that TkWWW now works. In such
a scheme we would have effectively OEM'ed the entire Mosaic
interface. 

What this entails:

Let us first see if we can come to consensus as to a general overall
architectural blueprint.

Assumptions:

o A monolithic WWW client is a thing of the past. WWW clients should
  be composed of a suite (flock) of small applets or accessories. Each
  one performing a part of the task.

o OEM's will produce these accessories, and they will be packaged together
  by system integrators to produce a WWW-client-suite. 

o Items can be added and removed from the suite on the fly.

o The items will visually and semantically mesh together seamlessly.

Metaphor:

The home stereo component/TV/VCR/Nintendo center. While there is
obviously one "document" that is running on these centers at a time,
and one focus of attention. Each accessory component hightens the
effect, and makes use of the special characteristics of its medium.

E.g. the are the main speakers, the surround speakers, the main program
showing on the TV (e.g. from VCR), the live TV inset on the screen, 
and the interactive controls.

Tools:

[Dave Martin's work with ICCM sound like it is something we should all
look at. But my gut reaction is that ICCM hacking is not the level
of attack that even he would prefer]

Let's assume we have either:

FRESCO on top of X11R6 (with CORBA types built in)

TK4.0 (also with embeddedable window objects)

Or

OLE 3.0 Which is what I think is the CORBA OLE V2.0 merge.
At least they are talking about some interapplication in OLE
in the Chicago release of Windows.

Therefore:

Given that we have the basic tools for live embedding of distributed
graphic objects - what should the architecture and protocol be:

Here is my take from my ACM MultiMedia'93 paper:

It is our belief that the basket of orchestration issues (section 3.0) 
should not be handled in a piecemeal approach. Just as an orches-
tra needs a single conductor, so do the "performers" in a distribut-
ed multimedia ensemble. In an orchestra, there is a single 
centralized decision maker who makes the scheduling, layout, 
and arrangement decisions. Global issues of tonal balance, match-
ing layout to the hall's acoustics, and balancing volume across the 
different pieces of the orchestra is not done on a piece-by-piece ba-
sis. Rather, there is a single centralized point of control where 
these decisions are carried out. Nor is each orchestration issue han-
dled separately or sequentially. Instead, due to the interaction be-
tween orchestration issues, they are all balanced within one 
sophisticated rule making system.


That is, I see the WWW-client suite as consisting of:

1. A central orchestration object. Whose job is to pull together
all the different accesories. Just like the home stereo/TV center,
there is basically one central activity going on - and all the
other activities are running in tandem - but they are basically
playing harmony.

2. A flock of accessory applications playing harmony

The outline of the protocol then is then not as hard as a general
purpose distributed programming problem. There is basically
one document under view at a time.

accessories basically rely ont he orchestrator for two services:

o being mapped to the composite window (I see a language like the
TK packer as being sufficient to start with).

o requesting (or suggesting) that the main document switch to
a different document

o receiving signals or messages from the orchestrator that the
main document has changed. And then they have the responsibility
of getting and subcomponent documents and "playing" them.

I would not try and centralize the interaction controls. Each
accessory in the stereo/TV system has its own unique GUI needs.

So too, I would want special hand-held remote-control forms
controllers to have their own interface.


I realize now, that I could keep going with this. 

However, we need to figure out what sort of consensus we have, and
what sort of effort we should put into this.

We have looked at using TXT records for some URN stuff and we have
found that not many people support TXT records.  They are
running old nameservers.  Although the RFC for nameservice does specify TXT 
records,  it seems that many name servers do not support it.
Version 4.9.930517 of bind's named does, but even it has some problems.
So, in order for this to work, everyone is going to have to upgrade
their stuff.  Both nameservers + the lookup code.

I am not arguing for or against, just mentioning technical problems.

Looks good, a definite improvement.  What about the table of contents?  But
more importantly, this list has been doing a lot of talk regarding the
future of HTML, and perhaps the time to implement these future changes
should be now, in the HTML Primer.

Like mentioning the <HTML><HEAD>....</HEAD><BODY>......</BODY></HTML> tags,
and their importance for the future.

Many html document creators get their feet wet using the HTML Primer as a
guideline (I know I did).  I'd like to see more direction from the Primer
about "proper" HTML markup so as to avoid having to go and change
everything to conform with HTML+, or proper HTML for that matter.

Is this possible?  Can Dan Connolly or other front runners in the HTML
scene lend a hand?

This will be added to the final version. (I've been running this through
my MIF->HTML filter, which ain't perfect yet and I'll twiddle a couple of
lines to generate the TOC...)

I just wanted to emphasize that this is A Beginner's Guide to HTML,
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^
and not The Complete Reference to HTML. :)

The intended audience is someone sitting in front of a text processor
who is utterly oblivious to SGML and who just wants to churn out some HTML. 
And as a result, I use a somewhat less stringent definition of conformance than
probably someone like Dan Connolly would prefer: namely, that 
conformance is "something that almost all browsers can grok and 
are likely to be able to continue grokking in the future" rather than
something that makes it through sgmls.

At a length of 14 pages (printed), this guide is already too long for
documenting a supposedly "lightweight" format. I left 
out discussions of <HTML>, <HEAD>, and <BODY> because they really aren't
needed for simple documents and would take a couple of pages to explain
them properly.

I'll probably add a paragraph under "For more information" that says something
like "Everything in this guide works, but is not exactly grammatically
precise HTML. Sort of like Cockney."

Although I acknowledge 14 pages is long for a Beginners' Guide,
I also think it is important to use <HTML>, <HEAD>, and <BODY>
at least in your "Longer Example", perhaps with a link in the 
"Here is a longer example" paragraph saying:
"For a discussion of <HTML>, <HEAD>, and <BODY>, see..."
In fact, there should be link with text that mentions HTML+, IMHO.

I used the Beginners' Guide and created a number of files before
I saw examples using <HEAD>, and <BODY>. I wish I had seen them on day one.

Agreed... if there are idioms we'd like to encourage/discourage,
this is the sort of place to do it.

>>Like mentioning the <HTML><HEAD>....</HEAD><BODY>......</BODY></HTML> tags,
>>and their importance for the future.

Could you expand on this? What is "their importance in the future"? I
thought the purpose of HEAD was, for example, so you could find the
TITLE without having to scan the whole doc -- once you'd found
</HEAD>, you're done. The same was supposed to be true of ISINDEX; but
Mosaic treats ISINDEX like ADDRESS or any of the other BODY elements.

My most recent take on HEAD and BODY tags is that they can (and
should) be inferred by a parser. So the doc:

	<title>t</title>
	<h1>h</h1>
	<p>para

parses the same as:

	<head><title>t</title></head>
	<body>
	<h1>h</h1>
	<p>para
	</body>

(this is using standard SGML tag inference.)

I agree that nothing in this primer should conflict with HTML
specifications. I suggested to Mr. Chang that he encourage the use
of <P> at the beginning rather than then end of paragraphs (so it's
use is more like <LI>, <DT>, and <DD>, though it can be used just
like <H1>..</H1>).

>>Is this possible?  Can Dan Connolly or other front runners in the HTML

Mr. Chang sent me the document for review, and after a few gentle
reminders, I finally sent him my comments. Overall, I think this is a
great "Beginner's Guide." He's working on including references to other
information like specifications, styleguides, etc.

Is there some reason why these two definitions must conflict? I have
no problem with the first definitition of conformance except that it's
useless to implementors and this leads to confusion and frustration
for document maintainers. The target of my DTD is to describe "what
browsers grok," except where they conflict with traditional SGML
techniques for no good reason (hmmm... how quickly personal prejudices
creep in no matter how you slice it!).

Agreed.

I hope this is not necessary. I don't see any reason why this
beginners guide should be technically inacurate in any way --
incomplete, yes; inaccurate, why? That would be a disservice to the
readers.

That doesn't work so well in lynx (2.2).  An example:

  <H1>header</H1>
  <P>an elephant
  <P>a zebra

Lynx puts extra space between the header and the first paragraph.

When I explain to people about using <P>, I usually say that it
should be used only *between two text paragraphs*:

  <H1>header</H1>
  an elephant
  <P>
  a zebra

As long as the person understands that a "paragraph" is different 
than a list item, a header, etc., this explanation works pretty well.

You're right -- "alternative" is too vague a word.  What I  
unfortunately have to think about as a document provider is the  
percentage of users trying to browse my server with a particular  
client.  Ideally, it wouldn't make any difference.  But at the  
present time it's a problem for documents that need to use features  
from HTML+.  For example:

As of version 2.4, X Mosaic still does not support the HTML+ synonym  
for the "image" input ("submit" with a SRC).  On the other hand, you  
refuse to make the older syntax available.  It's not really so  
important who is "right" -- it's the disagreements themselves that  
are the problem.

Lynx is broken. ;-)

Actually... I didn't know this. I wish we could get all the implementors
in a room and do rock-scissors-paper to decide how this is going to work.
There are lots of arguments out there, but none of them is very convincing.

I've been in the "P is a container" camp for a while, but I'll admit
it's a little awkward to write docs that way.

It comes down to two basic issues, to me:

	(1) HTML is or is not defined strictly in terms of SGML?

I'm pretty sold on the idea that it is a real application of SGML; i.e.
no HTML+-style inferring <P> tags when the SGML standard says you can't
do that.

Then, the question is: what's the structure of an HTML doc? If
everybody's mostly happy with tag soup, then there's no problem with
having P as a separator. But if you want to be able to reason
effectively about things like "the 3rd paragraph in section 2," then
there's motivation for seeing P as a container.

I don't care... I just hope that I get to go to WWW94 and join
in the shouting match that settles it once and for all. :-)

Dan

p.s. I've resumed hacking on html-mode... I started with a little
ditty that attempts to put in all these missing <P> tags to bring
a doc up to date... it also sticks "<!DOCTYPE ..." at the top.

I also changed the "html-add-code" etc. to work on the region, like a
good little word processor should: you select some text with the mouse
and choose Emphasize from the menu, and it wraps the selection with
<em>...</em>. How many times to you go "hmmm.. I think I'm going to
write some emphasized text..." versus "ah... that span of text should
be marked as CODE." Headers are the same way... type in the header,
select it, then make it a header.

This way is _much_ easer for hand-converting text documents into HTML.
Anybody interested?

I keep hearing about a WWW conference.  Is this open to the
public?  Can I get information on it like dates, places,
agenda, etc?

Thanks,

Sounds good to me. I'm just trying to interpret what everyone else has done. :)

And, while we're at it,
* <KBD> should be BOLD Courier
* <DFN> should be italics

(for those browsers with styled text, of course).
(End of personal list of gripes with Web browser formatting oddities.)

As the current reviser of the Beginner's Guide to HTML, the problem of <P>
for me is:

* for conformance with HTML+ and some DTDs of HTML, <P> should be a 
  beginning of paragraph marker.
* A non-trivial number of Web browsers use <P> as a paragraph separator.

Which would to lead to awkwardnesses such as 
"You should do this, but your browser will muck it up. 
But do it anyway, because it is good for you."

My compromise is to
* document <P> vis a vis its current usage as a paragraph separator.
* note its future conversion to a container

Would it be feasible to have a "merger" of this hacked html-mode and
the hm--html-menus package (available at e.g. info.cern.ch (pub/www/contrib),
sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs/) and
ftp.rrzn.uni-hannover.de (in /pub/unix/editors/lemacs/contrib)?

e.g. hm--html-menus has supported the "work on selection" for a long time...
Perhaps if Heiko Muenkel (the author) were willing to accept/coordinate
patches, extensions, etc. much effort could be saved...

There has been a pointer to the conference details
from http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
for a long time now.  It is at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, May 25-27,
jointly organized by CERN and CUI at Univ. Geneva. Contact address
is <www94@www.cern.ch>.

However, there has been enormous demand, and the limit of 300
attendees has been reached  :-(  It will clearly have to be repeated,
possibly twice yearly.  The procedings will be published on the web --
many of the papers are already there.   There were very many good papers
which had to be rejected, so future conferenecs may have to be longer
or have more tracks.

  I second Paolo's postscript.

  Adding to the please-merge-these-similar-packages discussion, I
suggest incoporating/building from/looking at the html-helper-mode
package by Nelson Minar. Html-helper-mode is based on html-mode and
I've found it to be a significant improvement--my main gripe is that
it doesn't support <P></P>...yet. I haven't seen hm--html-menus
package.

Here's the (pseudo?) LCD Archive Entry:

;; html-helper-mode|Nelson Minar|nelson@reed.edu|
;; Major mode for editing HTML.|
;; 16-Mar-94|Version 2.0|ftp://ftp.reed.edu/pub/src/html-helper-mode.tar.Z

  For more information--including the notable differences between
html-mode and html-helper-mode, see http://www.reed.edu/~nelson/.

Please send me your lisp code. I will see, if I can merge it with my own code.
I'm also interested in other extensions, suggestions and so on.

  I think everyone should standardize on psgml - the excellent SGML editing
mode by Lennart Stafflin.  It actually understands a DTD and only lets you
insert contextually valid tags (unless you are absolutely sure and want to
enter them by hand).  You will need a few sgml files (like ISOlat1, etc),
but this is a very general solution.  The next time the DTD is updated, you
don't have to go and rewrite your entire HTML editing mode - you just
recompile the DTD and psgml is ready to go.

  You can ftp a copy from ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/elisp/w3/psgml.tar.gz -
or you can get it straight from ftp.lysator.liu.se:/pub/sgml

which is being held at the Copley Plaza Hotel, Boston, from May 15-19.

I am arguably in a good situation to do this, since:

o The conference chair, Joe Boykin, is two doors down from me.
o I have a paper accepted at the conference.

BOF's are currently scheduled to run on Wednesday night.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Please send me topics that you feel would be appropriate.

This is what I see as a list of potential areas of discussion
[which I gleamed from: (a) my interests, (b) www-talk, (c)
comp.infosystems.www]

o Developing a new multi-component architecture for WWW clients
o Hierachical caching strategies
o Spiders, Worms, and WebWalkers (i.e. automatic Web indexing)
o Author-driven Web indexing
o The direction of HTML+ is going
o Greater author control of document layout vs. SGML philosophy

I would be glad to hear from others who have ideas on how to
organize this meeting, and who will be attending IEEE MM'94.

Thanks to all who responded.  Alas, the conference is full.

Will there be printed proceedings and if so will they be
made available?  (A WWW document of the proceedings sounds 
like it would be a real adventure for both editors and
readers.)

I would like to see an MBONE broadcast of some of the proceedings
since many (most?) people from the North America region won't be
able to attend.  Maybe a SIGWEB meeting could be scheduled for the 
same date and a virtual teleconference panel discussion could happen.

Are others interested in a telepresence?

  It *would* be great to get hooked up to the conference somehow.  In fact,
we've been looking into this.  One big obstacle is the nine-hour time
differential - we're thinking that playing a recording of the keynote may
be the best we can do.  It's all still just speculation at this stage.

Great idea... now if only it worked on the version of Emacs I have!

If psgml will work (and work on Mac and PC versions of Emacs like
html-mode does...) then I agree we should quit supporting html-mode.

Anyway... I think I'll keep my hack to myself for now. Sounds like
the features are already available with html-helper-mode.

One idea that I've been toying around with is to have a "virtual
hospitality suite" on a MOO somewhere so that people not at the
conference can interact with people who are.  The big problem is that
I think that the demand would quickly crash any MOO which wanted to
sponsor something like this.

Do any of you folks with Web walkers running happen to have an
accurate count of the number of Web servers you've discovered?

Does anyone have handy a count of the registered Web servers?
(I know, I could count this myself with a little work).

Have you tracked these numbers for any length of time?
Any idea what the annualized rate of growth is?

In the Gopher realm, the ratio of registered to unregistered
is about 1 to 5.  I'm curious what the ratio is in the Web
world.

Thanks...

Hello,

in addition I would like know some numbers about the documents. Eg. what
is the average number of documents on each server, how big are they in bytes,
counted with and without images, etc..

Are there any investigations under way? Hopefully, because I need those
numbers :-)

Best wishes,

Peter

That is exactly why they are important.  Both servers and tools that
wish to scan documents for metainformation should restrict themselves
to scan only properly-constructed <HEAD>...</HEAD> portions of documents,
stopping after the </TITLE> or X number of lines if <HEAD> does not occur
before then {X: X is just large enough to account for normal comments}.
Anything else is just too inefficient.

Once such servers and indexers exist, the need for those tags will become
obvious.  A beginner's guide should look to the future requirements of 
HTML documents, not just to the past.

DosLynx uses the Waterloo TCP library for TCP/IP.
All that is required is a packet driver or emulator.

Hi,
our www-machine has much traffic. Sometimes load is about 10. It is a
Sparc 10 with Solaris. It is also the ftp-Server.
There are about 10000 GETS per day. 
We have also much CGI's some of them are search engines. 

We would take another machine, but what is the best for this mix.
More CPU-Power, more processors, more ... ?

Some experiences?

] Here are my thoughts, for whatever they're worth, on breaking up
] clients (which I think is a great idea.)
]
 
I think you have some very good concepts here.

] 
] It seems to me you want to have accessories able to have access not
] just to the current "main" document but also to additional document
] information (essentially, those documents in a "local cache" of sorts,
] maintained by the main daemon.)  My apologies if you already were
] thinking in terms of something like this being plausible.
] 

Yes, But I have not decided what that list of shared resources
is. Indeed, I probably would prefer some sort of software CAM
as I proposed in the Orchestrator paper

(ftp://ftp.gte.com/pub/circus/papers/CircusTalk.ps)


] Sample use: Suppose, with high cache hit rates mitigating the
] influence on the net, a client does anticipatory fetching; it does a
] GET, or at least a HEAD, on all the links pointed to by the current
] document.  This information is employed by many different accessories;
] for instance, the HTML viewer may represent links that seem not to be
] fetchable in a special way, while an accessory for displaying a graph
] mapping the current hypertext structure (using REL and REV tags to do
] so in a meaningful way) uses that information (e.g. represent larger
] documents as bigger circles, represent content-type information with
] colors, or whatever.)
] 

Wow. The anticipatory fetching (shades of branch pre-fetching) is a
great idea for a plug in module. Thank you.

] For that matter, presumably there will be something (I'll call it an
] "window" though I'm not sure that's the best way to describe it) which
] constitutes all active applets with a given main document; there seems
] no reason not to allow multiple windows with the same (or different)
] applets tuned to a different "main" but using the same underlying
] "daemon" for handling interacting with servers with various protocols,
] doing caching, etc, though each window would have its own "conductor."
] Sensible?
] 

I think at this point we get into a philosophy of interface discussion.

For me, I am STRONGLY in favor of multi-modal user interfaces. That
is I (taking after Bill Buxton) like to be able to use multiple simultaneous
instruments to express my desires to the program. 

Buxton has a very nice example of this. He claims that the program interface
should be like a musical insttrument interface (e.g. oboe). A rich
interface with multiple modes of interaction. Current mouse based
interaces reduce a person to a cripple with one finger. A very limited
means of expressing oneself.

However, I am not sure I want these multiple artifices to be connected
simultaneously to multiple "applications". That is, if I am controlling
a jet fighter, I do not want one of my applet interfaces to be both
controlling the engines and the brightness of the panel lights.

This is why I tend to focus on a model of a single "main" document - with
applets providing additional accessory documents that operate
in tandem with the main document.

However, I may be missing the point you are making.

] 
] It might be useful for applets to communicate with each other,
] including possibly applets in different windows.  For instance, if I'm
] composing a document and have a document in the other window I want to
] create a link to, "sticking" the existing document into the editor
] document might be one way to do so.  Something of a drag-and-drop
] nature comes to mind, but I'm not sure.
] 

I am sure they will communicate with each other. The question is
what model do we use for communication? I prefer these sort of intelligent
blackboards/Software CAMS/tuple-spaces. It it easy to do what you
are asking in the next paragraph:


] One minor disadvantage is the fact that applets/accessories presumably
] would not have intimite access to the activities of the daemon, which
] would make it difficult for it to display things like the byte count
] of a transfer in progress.  It may be desirable to have the daemon act
] as an applet displaying a status box, or something like that.

Here I would have the deamon constantly updating a byte count register
in the shared tuple space. That way a byte count displayer applet
could be mapped to give the running byte count. For that matter,
a debugger applet could be mapped that would display all sorts
of interal information about the daemon as it is operating. 

Currently I am converting my Orchestrator to TCL-DP. So it should
be ready when TK4.0 comes out to use. Performance is quite encouraging.
I am getting over 2000 tuple operations/sec, on a single Ethernet
segment. 

] 
] Best of luck; I really hope something like this works.  It would add a
] lot of flexibility and open things up to innovation a lot more than a
] monolithic client that few people can understand or enhance.

New Directory Service for the Web
=================================

The X500 group at Brunel University invites comments on its
experimental WWW-X.500 gateway.

WLU is the WWW Lookup service. It provides:

	User-Friendly Name (UFN) searching
	Browse mode
	Flexible configuration
	Conversion of JPEG images to GIF on-the-fly

For more details, see:

	http://http1.brunel.ac.uk:8080/wlu.html

We believe this gateway is significantly more powerful than the WWW and
Gopher gateways already available.

The source code is not yet ready for distribution, but we are happy for
you to use our gateway to provide service to your users on the
understanding that we may have to turn off the gateway for upgrades or
if the load gets too high.

Please report any bugs or comments to:

	x500@brunel.ac.uk

Actually, a look through error_log (duh! should have done this before)
shows this:

[Thu Apr 21 13:24:23 1994] httpd: caught SIGSEGV, dumping core
[Thu Apr 21 13:25:14 1994] httpd: caught SIGSEGV, dumping core

There are tons of these.  At first I thought this might be the
culprit, but in testing this theory out, I found it didn't always
correlate to those lags.  However, it DID correlate to someone
accessing our site via Lynx (2.2) when looking at a page which uses
the server-side includes, which we are using heavily here for
copyright notices.  The document still gets delivered to Lynx, only
without the copyright notice (which is a very bad thing).  I also
couldn't find a core file it said it was producing.

This does sound like two distinct bugs, but it wouldnm't surprise
me if they were related.

Apologies if this was already discussed and fixed... but if not, this
seems pretty serious.

I didn't see this as one of the common problems in the readme file.

When I try to run Mosaic, the following appears in my console window:

Any ideas ?? My ld.so.1 file IS in /usr/lib.  It tried putting it with the

Many thanks in advance for any help that you can provide....Mosaic is great !!

I asked this a while ago to the prospero list... there has
been no response. I'm quite curious, so I'm expanding my
audience.

I'd really like a detailed answer, but pointers to materials
to read or other discussion forums (e.g. newsgroups) would
also be appreciated.

From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@ulua>


[I just subscribed to this list -- sorry if this has been hashed
over before, but I read through the mailing list archive...]

I'm interested in the possibility of using a Prospero in the role
that the HTTP proxy server is currently being used.

First, I'm interested in a comparison between ARDP and TCP. I gather
that transmission via ARDP uses less overhead than TCP. Are the
transactions supported by ARDP limited in some way that allows
optimization over TCP? Is ARDP "less reliable" in some way?

For example, could someone contrast in detail a gopher type 1
transaction with a prospero request? I gather the gopher transaction
goes something like:

	C: send "connect" request to server's host:port
	S: send "ACK"
	C: send gopher selector TCP packets
		[server and client "Do The Right Thing" with respect
		to reliablility]
	S: send text file back in TCP packets
		[more reliability stuff]

Could someone describe in more detail the number of IP round trips
in the gopher-over-tcp vs. prospero-over-ardp?

It's been a while since I read all about TCP, and even then I didn't
read carefully enough to fully understand it. But I'm very curious
to know how ARDP compares.

Finally... would it make sense for the prospero server to perform the
services of a gopher server directly? In other words, rather than:

	C: look up "/xyz" link in #/INET/EDU/ISI/xyz
	PS: send back link: HSONAME="1/xyz", ACCESS-TYPE="GOPHER '' '' ''"
	C: connect to gopher server @isi.edu, send HSONAME "1/xyz"
	GS: send back "/xyz" file contents

it might be nice to just do:

	C: get "/xyz" from #INET/EDU/ISI/xyz
	PS: send link info plus contents of xyz file

The prospero server could perform FTP, Gopher, etc. accesses itself
and cache the results, and pass them on to the client. (Hmm...
security issues...)

And/or, the client could, in the "get" request, include information
about what domains it can reach and what access methods it supports.
If the prospero server can access the file but the client can't, the
prospero server would do the gateway thing. Else if the client can
access the file, the prospero server just passes the link info along
for the client to resolve. Else you're out of luck.

Hello all,

By popular demand, I have written a conversion program (based on my
wwwstat log analyzer) which takes as input an NCSA access_log of
version 1.1 format and outputs the new format for version 1.2,
including very close approximations for the bytes transferred and
the response codes.

It is now available at

      http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/wwwstat/oldlog2new.txt

and   ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/wwwstat/oldlog2new.txt

Which means release.  We  will be doing some LIMITED test releases first
then on to a more public release.  Will post here when it's ready to go.

get the text back from NCSA Mosaic for X,  I get my CRLF's for any unmodified
text plus LF's for any newly added lines.  It's easy to handle this, just use
the LF's as delimiters and throw out any CR's.  But what's going to happen when
NCSA Mosaic 2.0 for the Mac comes out?  Do I need to start looking for CR, LF,
or CRLF's?

    What should the standard be?  CRLF's like the TELNET RFC, converted 
locally to whatever's convenient?

	I like to stick to the TELNET standard,  CR/LF delimited lines. 
Then run by the ROT,  "be liberal about what you accept,  conservative 
about what you generate".   So I'd say your server's on the right track.

	Right.   I used to maintain a system that didn't use CR or 
LF or NL or *anything* for the line delimiter.   Lines were delimited 
out of band,  so you could have embedded CRs and/or LFs.  It didn't care. 
But it's much less confusing to use CR/LF  "on the wire".

Subject: Announcing wwwstat-1.0 -- an NCSA httpd access log summary program 
Date: Sat, 23 Apr 1994 02:29:28 -0700
From: "Roy T. Fielding" <fielding@simplon.ICS.UCI.EDU>
Message-Id:  <9404230229.aa29645@paris.ics.uci.edu>

This message is to announce the availability of wwwstat Version 1.0 --
a program for analyzing NCSA httpd_1.2 or earlier server access logs and
printing an HTML-formatted summary report.  The program is written in Perl
and, once customized for your site, should work on any UNIX-based system
with Perl 4.019 or better.

As an example of what wwwstat can do for you, look
    <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Admin/wwwstats.html"> here </A>
to see UC Irvine's Department of Information and Computer Science
WWW server statistics.

For more information and access to the wwwstat-1.0 distribution,
point your World-Wide Web client at

    <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/wwwstat/"> wwwstat-1.0 </A>.

For those of you without offsite http access but with ftp access, wwwstat is
also available via anonymous ftp at:

    <ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/wwwstat/wwwstat-1.0.tar.Z>

One of the nicest things about wwwstat is that it does not make any changes
to or write any files in the server directories. Thus, this program can be
safely run by any user with read access to the httpd server's access_log and
srm.conf files. This allows people to do specialized summaries of just the
things they are interested in.

Version 1.0 provides a plethora of options for creating customized
reports and for making it easier for webmasters to maintain their server.
It is also significantly different (more features) than version 1.0a, so
if you picked that up over the past few days you will want to get this one
as well.  I do not anticipate any more versions until mid June at the
earliest, since I'll be in Europe for most of May (see ya at WWW'94!).


Usage: wwwstat [-helLoOuUrvx]  [-s srmfile] [-i pathname]
               [-a IP_address] [-c code] [-d date] [-t hour] [-n archive_name] 
               [-A IP_address] [-C code] [-D date] [-T hour] [-N archive_name] 
               [logfile ...]   [logfile.gz ...]    [logfile.Z ...]

Display Options:
     -h  Help -- just display this message and quit.
     -e  Display all invalid log entries on STDERR.
     -l  Do display full IP address of clients in my domain.
     -L  Don't (i.e. strip the machine name from local addresses).
     -o  Do display full IP address of clients from other domains.
     -O  Don't (i.e. strip the machine name from non-local addresses).
     -u  Do display IP address from unresolved domain names.
     -U  Don't (i.e. group all "unresolved" addresses under that name).
     -r  Display table of requests by each remote ident or authuser.
     -v  Verbose display (to STDERR) of each log entry processed.
     -x  Display all requests of nonexistant files to STDERR.
Input Options:
     -s  Get the server directives from the following srm.conf file.
     -i  Include the following file (assumed to be a prior wwwstat output).
    ...  Process the sequence of logfiles (compressed if extension (gz|Z|z)).
Search Options (include in summary only those log entries):
     -a  Containing a  hostname/IP address  matching the given perl regexp.
     -A  Not containing   "      "     "       "      "      "   "    "
     -c  Containing a  server response code matching the given perl regexp.
     -C  Not containing   "      "     "       "      "      "   "    "
     -d  Containing a  date ("Feb  2 1994") matching the given perl regexp.
     -D  Not containing   "      "     "       "      "      "   "    "
     -t  Containing an hour ("00" -- "23")  matching the given perl regexp.
     -T  Not containing   "      "     "       "      "      "   "    "
     -n  Containing an archive (URL) name   matching perl regexp (except +.).
     -N  Not containing   "      "     "       "      "      "   "    "



What's new in this version:

Version 1.0                                       April 23, 1994
   Now supports the NCSA httpd_1.2 "common" log format.
   As a result, all attempts to figure out file size are gone
   and there is no longer any need for all those fstat tests.
   Code for srm parsing of aliases and scripts has been removed.
   Basically, the entire log parsing section was rewritten and 
   then placed in a subroutine to allow for multiple logfiles.
   Bunches of unnecessary backslashes removed from print statements.
   Time of last update now includes GMT offset instead of full GMT.
   Tries to estimate size of headers and error messages to account
   for bytes that are not included in the log entry byte count.
   Allows perl regular expressions (where possible) in all searches.
   Allows multiple logfiles to be analyzed in sequence, with any
   compressed logfiles automatically recognized by their file extension.
   Removed -f and -z options because they are no longer needed.
   Added -c option for searching based on server response code.
   Added the uppercase options -A, -C, -D, -T, and -N which perform
   the negation of the corresponding lowercase letters, i.e. they
   force wwwstat to not include any log entries with the given pattern
   in the address, response code, date, time, or archive name.

Version 0.4  (now called oldwwwstat)              April 19, 1994
   Removed escapes to allow regular expressions in -d and -t searches.
   Fixed minor bug of outputing </HEAD> instead of </HTML>.
   Made use of $startTag and $endTag explicit for report output.
   Added option to append subdomain info on end of local hosts.
   Added support for IdentityCheck (rfc931) logfile format.
   Added output of Totals by Remote Identifier when Do_Ident is requested.
   Added -r option to select Do_Ident when IdentityCheck is enabled.
   NOTE: For security reasons, you should not publish to the web any
         report that lists the Remote Identifiers.  This option is
         intended for server maintenance only.


If you have any suggestions, bug reports, fixes, or enhancements,
send them to me at <fielding@ics.uci.edu>.  Also, I would like to ask anyone
who uses wwwstat on a regular basis to please send me an e-mail message which
indicates how and where it is being used (i.e. to publish stats, perform
research, assist in server maintenance, and/or just allow HTML authors to
see how much their work is appreciated) and also, if it is public information,
a URL to your site. This is, of course, only voluntary and I don't want
anyone to divulge private information, but please understand that such
information allows free-software authors like me to justify the time and
effort needed to build quality tools.

Have fun,

Subject: Minor patch to wwwstat-1.0 and old2newlog
Date: Sun, 24 Apr 1994 06:34:31 -0700

Hello all wwwstat users,

If you are one of the few who picked up wwwstat-1.0 before or
oldlog2new before 6am PST (GMT -0700) this morning, you should apply
the following minor patch.  The change is so that wwwstat and oldlog2new
correctly handle leading zeros in the day number of the new log format.
Note that this will not have any effect on wwwstat processing until your
1.2 server gets to the first of next month, and so old logs already 
converted do not need to be fixed (unless you really want to).

To apply a patch, save the stuff between the "---" lines below to
a file called patch10to101.txt, move that file to the wwwstat-1.0
directory, and then do the command:

     % patch < patch10to101.txt

If you do not have the patch program, just get a new copy of the distribution
from
      http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/wwwstat/
or    ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/wwwstat/

patch10to101.txt is:

That's about comperable to the transaction count for our server,
except we have a Sparc 2 (x4) running SunOS which also serves FTP and
has a few dozen interactive users, and haven't had load problems
unless lots of people perform extensive searches or somebody runs a
raytracer.

>We have also much CGI's some of them are search engines.

Ah ha...

>We would take another machine, but what is the best for this mix.
>More CPU-Power, more processors, more ... ?

My offhand guess would be fewer execs.  Forking should be dirt cheap
under Solaris (it does copy-on-write, doesn't it?) but CGI requires
exec calls, particularly if you have a lot of frequently used CGIs
which are lightweight and don't involve intensive searching.

You don't mention how much physical memory you currently have; unless
it's really the case that the search engine executing is taking the
lions share of resources (as opposed to the time to load it, the time
to fetch large files from disk, etc) that might be the first candidate
for enhancement.  Our server has 128 megs.

Obviously there are other potential tricks (multiple machines with
round-robin IP, run search engines on another machine via RPCs,
reallocation of nice levels, etc.) depending exactly where the load is
coming from.

Cc: sam@wugate.wustl.edu
content-length: 1136


Project DA-CLOD is a distributedly administered
centrally stored database of hyperlinks.

What's new 1.1 -> 1.11

Because of a missing tag which NCSA Mosaic forgave,
Lynx users were not able to follow any links.
This bug has been fixed.

What's new 1.01 -> 1.1

Visual category tree or subtree document (reason for new release).
At any level following the "Category subtree" link displays an indented
hyperlinked hierarchic tree of categories below the current category,
up to 10 levels deep.  The "Subtree with documents" link provides the
tree including all the document links.

Text link to parent category for text-only browsers.

What's new 1.0 -> 1.01

Added link to reload current.  Using Mosaic's Reload button
resends the query (usually harmless).  Also, using the Mosaic's Back
button after deleting categories displays obsolete categories, so this
link should be used to refresh the menu.

Fixed formatting of generated HTML source.
This also fixed visited anchor underline colour change.

Added error message for no longer existing categories.

Thanks to all those who submitted suggestions, comments and bug reports.

Subject: Resend: ARDP vs. TCP; prospero as proxy
content-length: 4127

Our apologize for taking so long to get back to you.  We should have
responded to your ordinal message, but it got misplaced on our action list.

  I'm interested in the possibility of using a Prospero in the role
  that the HTTP proxy server is currently being used.

By proxy server, I assume you mean a server that accepts queries from
local clients, accesses the requested service on behalf of the client,
caches the result, and returns it to the client.

Prospero can fill this role for some kinds of data.  In particular,
Prospero is currently best suited for storing directory information
(including Gopher menus), but it does not provide the data in the
documents themselves (actually, it can through the CONTENTS attribute,
but not as efficiently as it does directory information).  We are
working on extensions in the form of a Prospero Data Access Protocol
(PDAP) that will provide better support for document retrieval itself,
and I'd be happy to discuss these with you further.

We are currently working on adding Prospero support to Mosaic, and
together with the data acess extensions I just mentioned, I think
Prospero could provide exactly what you want.

   First, I'm interested in a comparison between ARDP and TCP. I gather
   that transmission via ARDP uses less overhead than TCP. Are the
   transactions supported by ARDP limited in some way that allows
   optimization over TCP? Is ARDP "less reliable" in some way?

The goal of the Asynchronous Reliable Delivery Protocol (ARDP) is to
optimize the common case which is a one packet request, followed b a
one packet response.  However, ARDP does support multi-packet
responses quite efficiently when needed, and it does handle retries if
packets are lost.  What it is not suited to is a back and forth
interaction, where the client sends more data, after the first data
has been returned by the server.  As to efficiency, because Prospero
is layered over ARDP, the overhead for connection establishment (in
terms of round trip messages) that is present with TCP is avoided.

Further, our server accepts requests and processes them in the same
address space, instead of forking a subprocess.  Our server is also
multi-threaded, and if the load is such that all threads are in use,
requests are queued and are handled in the order received (or as
defined by user specified priorities and server heuristics).

   Could someone describe in more detail the number of IP round trips
   in the gopher-over-tcp vs. prospero-over-ardp?

For Prospero over ARDP

	C: sends query to server on host:udpport
        S: if server knows it will take a while, it sends ack, or it
	S: sends response

The ack is piggybacked on the response if the server expects to
respond quickly.  If the response requires more than one packet,
multiple packets are sent.  Flow control only kicks in if the response
is greater than a server or client specified window size.

   Finally... would it make sense for the prospero server to perform the
   services of a gopher server directly? In other words, rather than:

  	C: look up "/xyz" link in #/INET/EDU/ISI/xyz
	PS: send back link: HSONAME="1/xyz", ACCESS-TYPE="GOPHER '' '' ''"
	C: connect to gopher server @isi.edu, send HSONAME "1/xyz"
	GS: send back "/xyz" file contents

   it might be nice to just do:

	C: get "/xyz" from #INET/EDU/ISI/xyz
	PS: send link info plus contents of xyz file

This can be done in two ways.  At present, the contents could be sent
back as the contents attribute of a link.  However, for sending
potentially large files, we are working on PDAP (mentioned above),
which could provide better flow control.

   And/or, the client could, in the "get" request, include information
   about what domains it can reach and what access methods it supports.
   If the prospero server can access the file but the client can't, the
   prospero server would do the gateway thing. Else if the client can
   access the file, the prospero server just passes the link info along

The problem we were having with lagging in httpd 1.2 was fixed by turning 
off identd checks (why didn't I do that before?  I had used the old config
files from 1.1, and IdentityCheck was a new option I didn't have listed,
and the default was to have it on - my fault I guess).  It still doesn't
explain why the lag to one connection would logjam all the other connections
(as was its apparent behaivor).  

The problem with core dumps showing up when Lynx tries to access our 
pages with server-side includes still exists, though.

Nope. Under Solaris forking is an increadibly expensive operation.
if you can, do NOT fork (or vfork or anything like that). Solaris
will drive people back to monolithic programs.

Subject: Who can express URL syntax with BNF
content-length: 717

No, I did not read the www-talk archive. But the parser of my HTTP server
for Windows will be an ugly piece of code, if it cannot decide what to do:

GET /1234?Name=foo&Age=21 HTTP/1.0     seems to be a form, handled specially
GET /1234?Name=foo HTTP/1.0            is a form or a textsearch
GET /1234?Name+foo HTTP/1.0            is a textsearch
GET /1234?Name%20foo HTTP/1.0          is a textsearch as well?
GET /1234?777,888 HTTP/1.0             is a specejump (or textsearch?)

So, how to decide whether to process forms, do a textsearch or do a spacejump.

HTTP protocol states that spacejump and textsearch methods are done via GET.
Why don't we use SPACEJUMP or TEXTSEARCH to disambiguate our syntax?

Back in January there was a discussion on this list about returning 
status information with scripts.

Basically the idea was that a script could keep returning extra headers
at various points and these would get displayed by the clients in the
status area. Example:

	some headers
	Status: Search starting
	Status: Search is 10% complete (then a little while later)
	...
	Status: Search complete
	rest of headers
	html document

Was a decision ever reached about how feasible this is?   Did anyone
attempt to add this?

Folks:

Over the last 10 days/ 2 weeks mention has been made of at least 3
alternative HTML+ specs, DTDs, or whatever.  Assuming I counted right,
that is.  Would somebody who knows care to post a summary of author,
status, and location for all of them?  

Best,
Tb.

I made some attempts to write a yacc grammar for URL's, but it wasn't
a very valuable excercise... regular expression matching works pretty well;
e.g.:

	$Word = '[^/=;?#]*';

	$scheme = $1 if s*^([A-Za-z0-9\.-]+):**; # @# syntax of scheme?
	$hostport = &unescape($1) if s*^//($Word)**;
	$fragment = &unescape($1) if s*#($Word)$**;
	$search = &unescape($1) if s*\?($Word)$**;
	$path = &unescape($_);

The URL spec has gotten really watered down by the IIIR working
group...  the WWW aplication needs more structure than the URL spec
gives, so there's a URI spec that Tim has written to explain the rest.
Anyway... I'm still not sure all the syntactical issues have been
completely hammered out.

Many of these syntaxes are opaque to the URI syntax (spacejump is just
an ordinary search URL, as far as the spec goes). They're
server-specific mechanisms that some clients know how to exploit.

Anyway... the way to disambiguate is to tell the client to give you
more info in the path. For example, have the client send:

GET /1234/textsearch?Name%20foo HTTP/1.0
GET /1234/spacejump?777,888 HTTP/1.0

Hmmm... actually, I think you've found a real problem: what if
somebody wants to put both types of queries in one document? e.g. what
if a node has both <ISINDEX> and <IMG ISMAP>, and the user enters
"777,88" in the search text area? (Forms is not so much of a problem:
you can put ACTION="/disambiguating/path" and give the server enough
info to decide it's a form).

It seems that this actually does need to be part of the protocol, and
not just an application-specific use of the protocol.

>HTTP protocol states that spacejump and textsearch methods are done via GET.

Where? Why are spacejump and textsearch part of the protocol at all?
I thought they were just applications of the protocol?

>Why don't we use SPACEJUMP or TEXTSEARCH to disambiguate our syntax?

Because nobody thought it was necessary... looks like they were wrong.

In this case they should use:
<ISINDEX action="SOME_URL">
and 
<a href="SOME_OTHER_URL"><IMG ISMAP></a>

Since you can use seperate url's you can encode the specifics of the
operation in the URL even though the same CGI-BIN script is called.

Well, it's extremely feasible.  A nph- CGI script can trivially
output the Status: headers.  A quite small modification to libwww2
could pass Status: contents on to the browser (look in HTMIME.c).

As far as I know, noone has added it to any browser or server.
Too helpful to the user in some cases and too simple to implement,
I guess.

tkWWW Version 0.11 beta (joe@mit.edu)
--------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext project which seeks to build a
world wide network of hypertext links.  There are several different
browsers for this system including a simple tty interface.

Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily.

tkWWW is a Tk interface to (WWW).

Since the entire user interface is written in an interpreted language,
it is very easy to make modifications and extensions to the system.
tkWWW is the first X11 browser with the ability to edit HTML!!!!!

Requirements
------------
tkWWW requires the installation of the tk and tcl packages which can
be retrieved from sprite.berkely.edu

To display images, tkWWW requires the xli package which can be
retrieved from ftp.x.org

To Install the single executable version of tkWWW
-------------------------------------------------
In this directory

content-length: 3783

Oops.  I just realized that I left out where to get tkWWW 0.11 in the
previous announcement.  There is the new announcement with that
information.


tkWWW Version 0.11 beta (joe@mit.edu)
--------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext project which seeks to build a
world wide network of hypertext links.  There are several different
browsers for this system including a simple tty interface.

Tk is an interpreted toolkit which allows one to build X11 applications
quickly and easily.

tkWWW is a Tk interface to (WWW).

Since the entire user interface is written in an interpreted language,
it is very easy to make modifications and extensions to the system.
tkWWW is the first X11 browser with the ability to edit HTML!!!!!

To get tkWWW 0.11
---------------------
tkWWW can be anonymous ftped from 

info.cern.ch:/pub/www/src/tkWWW-0.11.tar.Z
ftp.x.org:/contrib/tkWWW-0.11.tar.Z
harbor.ecn.purdue.edu:/pub/tcl/extensions/tkWWW-0.11.tar.Z

Requirements
------------
tkWWW requires the installation of the tk and tcl packages which can
be retrieved from sprite.berkely.edu

To display images, tkWWW requires the xli package which can be
retrieved from ftp.x.org

To Install the single executable version of tkWWW
-------------------------------------------------
In this directory

1. Type "./configure"
2. Type "make"
3. Type "make install"

To Install the interpreted version of tkWWW
-------------------------------------------
In this directory

1. Type "./configure"
2. Type "make interp"

   Send in patches and I'm sure most of us would consider merging them into
our browsers.  Otherwise, I'd say it was pretty low on the priority list
for most people.  MacMosaic wants forms, WinMosaic needs stability.  tkWWW
needs a few more things first, and all the browsers need more HTML+
capabilities.

                                MAP_MARKER V0.2

        MAP_MARKER is a tool for generating clickable image maps for use
with HTML browsers.  It has been written by Gudge Chandramohan,
undergraduate from South bank University, London, UK as part of an industrial
training year at Glaxo R&D, Greenford.

        MAP_MARKER is available through www as a tar.Z file under:

http://www.dl.ac.uk/CBMT/mapmarker/v02a/doc_html/HOME.html

        MAP_MARKER V0.2 is written in tcl/tk and allows the user to:

        - read an image file in EITHER *.xbm OR *.rppm format
        - optionally read in a NCSA format imagemap file (*.map)
        - create, move, edit, copy and delete the following shapes:
                - circle
                - rectangle
                - polygon
        - display these in a variety of styles and colour on top of the image
        - save the session as a NCSA imagemap file, including the display
                attributes
        - load image automatically (from comments in *.map file)
	- test the validity of URL's

The next release will have the additional features:

        - Motif-style bindings
        - Filebrowsers for images, maps and URLs
        - Display of comments as textual annotation
        - automatic conversion of gif files to images.
        - prioritisation of overlapping areas

        If you have used a previous version, we would appreciate any comments
We have also made some assumptions about the format of the IMAGEMAP file, 
so please let us know if we've got anything wrong!

Minor question:
This looks like perl, but I can't quite parse the regexps.
Is this some variant perl dialect or alternate regexp syntax?

Major question: This reminds me of an issue I strumbled across
recently, about the possible coexistence of #label and ?query-string
in the same URL. I did some experiments with Mosaic 2.4 that
suggested it did not recognize both in the same URL (ignored
the label, I think, although it was ignoring labels in any
script results when relative URLs were used, so I am not
positive how it interprets this combination in all contexts.)
Your regexps do not suggest any exclusion between #label
and ?query; I can't tell if it imposes an order on them.
Does anyone know what the official (? is there such a thing?)
position is on the legality and syntax of combining #label
and ?query in one URL?

Sorry... it's just perl... Practical Extraction and Reporting Line-noise.

Hmmm... from "Universal Resource Identifiers: BNF"
	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/5_URI_BNF.html

the following productions:

fragmentaddress 
   uri [ # fragmentid ] 
uri 
   scheme : path [ ? search ] 

would suggest
	http://host.com/database?search#fragment
is kosher.

The fact that none of the following characters:

reserved 
   = | ; | / | # | ? | : | space 

can occur in a fragmentid or search leaves no ambiguity that I can see.

(thoug it means that http://host.com:3000/ doesn't parse -- the colon
is no good).

We really need a spec that disambiguates cases like this. That's why
I'm building a test suite:
	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/url_test/

What's there is pretty old...

Ah yes... the old "see what Mosaic does" test. Hardly satisfying.

Well... the URI working group completely balked on this sort of
thing...  In their game, a URL is just scheme:opaque-string, with the
syntax of the string defined on a per-scheme basis.

In response to that, the WWW team sort of "took their marbles and went
home." Tim's editing a URI standard that has all the WWW mechanisms in it.
See Tim's collected notes:

It's not in "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Web/httpd" anywhere.

Where can I get it ??

Im sure Rob will tell you this bit...

@ Is there a httpd from NCSA for Solaris .....

No - at the momement as it stands it wont quite compile under Solaris.
That was as of a week or so back as I recall.

@ It's not in "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Web/httpd" anywhere.

@ Where can I get it ??

If you have the binary compatability stuff installed I can confirm that
it runs very well under that. I have a SunOS 4.1.3 and a Solaris 2.3
machine sharing binaries and well the solaris machine (albeit with a
lighter load but less memory) is more than keeping pace with the 4.1.3
machine.... And well neither core dump. :)

(Oh and yes I have gone back to httpd 1.1 for the moment - its a long
story - but binary compat works there too :)

I managed to get it to compile (1.2) and it seems to be running pretty
reliably. I have "SunOS nlp01 5.2 Generic sun4m sparc"

It wasn't completely straightforward as I remember, but it's possible.

Use httpd from CERN.

You can get it at CERN.

You need to copy the #define for getwd from the HPUX section into the
Solaris section in httpd.h. Or, you can compile it with the UCB

binary compatibility.

I'm thinking of yanking 1.2 from the server and telling people to use 1.1
until I've had a chance to fix things. There are a lot of problems with 1.2.

Hi,

is it possible to put multiple lines of text next to an image in a html
document?

What I want to do is this :

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    line 1 of text
X                     X    line 2 of text
X      image          X     ...
X                     X     ...
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX     ...

I've been around the web for some time and have never that anywhere...

Mike.

Subject: Announcing fwais.pl v0.9: an HTTP to WAIS CGI script
content-length: 21548

I'd like to formally announce "[nph-]fwais.pl, an HTTP to WAIS CGI script.

This is a perl script that uses the functionality of the "waisq" unix shell
level interface to perform WAIS style queries using an HTTP/HTML+ (forms)
compatible browser (like Mosaic 2.0).

The gateway allows the searching of multiple sources in a single query,
simple management of the selectable sources, and the ability to search
new WAIS sources found as a result of searching a WAIS source server.  It
supports multiple-type results and attempts to highlight (bold) matched
keywords in TEXT documents.

This is my first general release of the code.  It works for me, but it
might not work for you.  Please send me any fixes you might come up with.

Documentation is in the code. 8^)

# loosely based on wais.pl from Tony Sanders <sanders@bsdi.com>
#
# Documentation: (yes, that's right, self documenting code!)
#
# This script is designed to work with the NCSA CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
# It uses a GET method form, so all the input to this script is
# in the environment variable "QUERY_STRING"
#
# If you name this script as nph-<whatever>, it will return
#  more appropriate error codes.
#
# This script has three modes of operation:

# 1.  No input (QUERY_STRING emtpy, but really no Sources specified)
#     with no input, the script builds a dialog form with all sources in
#     the $waisd directory displayed.  The user then selects source and
#     sets the keywords, and go.
#
# 2.  keyword search (keywords=...)
#     with a list of sources and keywords, the script performs a search and
#     returns a list of results.  Multitype results are supported.  HREFs
#     are built with this script and sufficient state to retrieve the
#     document.
#
#     A special case of this is when the source has an @ in it.  This is 
#     interpreted as a database spec, and a temporary source is created from
#     it.  This is how you can search a WSRC that you find from searching
#     some other source (like the directory-of-servers).
#
# 3.  retrieval (keywords_used=...)
#     with a list of keywords_used, the script retrieves a document.
#     Depending on the $type, it either builds an HTML result (for TEXT and
#     WSRC) or it returns the content-type associated with the $type, and
#     the raw bytes.
#
# If you must test this, take a look at the conversation it has with the HTTP server
# and set the QUERY_STRING environment variable accordingly.
#
# For the future:
#
#  Although I believe this does just about everything you would ever want to do,
#  in a WAIS search, there are still a few things left for the adventursome
#  perl hackers to add:
#
# 1.  Relevance Feedback:
#     This one's the hardest of the bunch - how would you express a
#     relevant document using an HTML form?
#

Hi,

Are there any plans on making group annotations a part of NCSA or CERN
servers?  With access authorization, this would solve the problem with
the old NCSA annotation server (on httpd 0.5) that had served only public
annotations.  With ACLs different groups can annotate different files.
Anyone tackling this?

Regards,

Makoto

Okay, 

Im sitting here writing up a spec into HTML (by hand of course :) and
one thought just struck me, and looking at the DTD I cant decide if I am
right or wrong.

Is the following valid HTML?

<HEAD>
    <TITLE>
	A title
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
    <H1>
	some text
        <HR>
    </H1>
</BODY>

That is, can I justifiably use the <HR> tag inside a <H#> tag? (#=1..6)
Im thinking not which is a shame because the specification say that
there needs to be a complete clear line between a </H#> tag and the next
line of whatever. This means that you cant get the <HR> right up close
under the text which is sometimes quite desirable (Like in this case for
example....)

Any ideas? Am I wrong in thinking it is invalid? 

Paul

I too would like to see group and/or public annotation to return.  It
currently can be kludged with a bunch of forms and scripts, but 
authentication is still clumsy (since it can really only get the
machine name, not the user name).

Well, I'm not so sure.  It seems that the browser writers are so busy
that they can barely consider bug fix patches never mind extra feature
patches.  Experience suggests that you'd better convince them to
add the feature before you implement it.  But in the spirit of
optimism, I include here:

	Status: patches to Mosaic 2.4 for X (2 diffs)
	Status: patches to Lynx 2.2 (2 diffs)
	A nph- CGI script to test Status: extensions which can be called
		at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/test-status

The patches are trivial.  First make HTMIME.c check for "Status:" header
lines and call HTProgress() with their contents.  Then do the "bytes read"
call in HTCopy() before you pass the data on down the stream so
the "Status:" lines will override the "bytes read" messages.

@ 
@ The answer is currently NO for html+ as HR is seen as a block like element.

In that case then is there any chance of making it so?

For example compare something like:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
    <TITLE>
	A title.
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
    <H1>
	This is an header
	<HR>
    </H1>
    Just a bit of text for example purposes...
</BODY>
</HTML>

to:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
    <TITLE>
        A title.
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
    <H1>
        This is an header
    </H1>
    <HR>    
    Just a bit of text for example purposes...
</BODY>
</HTML>

Just from a presentation point of view I think that the 1st one looks a
little cleaner. (No it isnt just a Mosaic-ism *grin* Look at it in Lynx
too)... Infact here is a sample:

This is the 1st one in Lynx which is "suposedly" (No offence meant Lou -
just trying to avoid Mosaic as an example case - no offence NCSA either
*grin*) more HTML/HTML+ compliant:

                               1.0 INTRODUCTION.
   __________________________________________________________________________
 
   In order to create an effective X.500 browser for the World Wide Web

and this is in lynx in the SECOND case:

                               1.0 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
     _________________________________________________________________
 
   In order to create an effective X.500 browser for the World Wide Web


Question: Which looks nicer? To me the 1st case.
Question: Which is ``correct''? The 2nd.

Try it in Mosaic. The result is much the same... that extra white space
is just too much to bear.

Im not asking for that much of a redifinition (I think *grin*) all Im
asking is the certain tags (well only HR actually I think) be modified
slightly so they can exist inside the <H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6> tags.

Does anyone else support this move? Can anyone see any problems?

Thanks,

Paul

Correct HTML/HTML+, yes. From the point of view of the logical structure of the 
document - which the HTML claims to represent - the rule is clearly a top line, 
a part of the title; it is not a piece of body matter in this instance. So I 
would argue that the first case is correct; it is just that HTML does not 
support it yet.

>From the point of view of clarity of communication, an HR in the place Paul 
suggests makes the document easier to read - it conforms with established 
convention. Look at chapter headings in any software manual, for example ;-)

And I remember that the spec says an Hn element includes all the space needed to 
set it off from the body text. So anything else which is part of the header 
should be included in the Hn - an image for instance. In that way, the html 
reflects the document structure that the designer intended, which I thought was 
the whole point.

Now that HTML is being re-DTD'ed based on current practice - an excellent idea - 
it would be timely to make this change too.

Speaking with my other hat on,

I am afraid that I don't agree with you, even on the aesthetics
of your example. Look at printed books and how they give chapter
headings. White space is used liberally to set off the heading.

I do agree that authors should have more control over appearence
and consequently have added alignment parameters to headings and
paragraphs in HTML+. Other ideas are under consideration e.g.
the paragraph style, the font names (as URNs of course) and text
and background colours (and texture), and margins.

@ I am afraid that I don't agree with you, even on the aesthetics
@ of your example. Look at printed books and how they give chapter
@ headings. White space is used liberally to set off the heading.

Okay, just a quick counter. I have just pulled out my copy of the HTML
(not HTML+) specification by TBL. This has a page of the form:


Low_Level header - e.g. document name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEVEL 2 HEADER

lots and lots of text
so that you use up a 
few lines

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page number etc at the foot

(I know this could be done many ways, but using headers also allows for
some structure in the document)

It would be nice to be able to define the headers and footers in <H#>
style and still have the <HR> close to the text is what I am getting
at. And like you say:

@ I do agree that authors should have more control over appearence
@ and consequently have added alignment parameters to headings and
@ paragraphs in HTML+.

*nod* I know. What I am trying to say is why not just go this simple one
stage further. I know Martijn Koster is "worried" about this being a
client side issue, and to a large extent I do agree. But the client
needs some help, and depending on the context the positioning of that
line can make all the difference. I cant think of any now, but I had two
examples in mind earlier, if I remember them (I know I should have
written them down then and there :) Ill let you all know...

@                       Other ideas are under consideration e.g.
@ the paragraph style, the font names (as URNs of course) and text
@ and background colours (and texture), and margins.

My big worry here is that this may prove to be "complicated" I guess.
What I am suggesting is a reasonably simple change at the DTD level that
could provide quite a big change at the rendering level, and enable
roughly the same HTML (moving one line inside or outside a header) to
convay 2 different contexts.

Under the "proposed" method I think for what I have seen you would need
to set up a paragraph style just for that header type, which seems a
little bit of a waste to me when you could do it with just a small
change to the DTD :) I know its a flexibility/presentability against
SGMLS style conformity thing though.

It really is only just a thought that I came up with the other day
having seen how many of my documents use the trick, and whilst coverting
a specification over I realised may not be valid HTML/HTML+. And like
Chris Lilly says, its a trick a lot of us are using, and can make things
look just that little bit better, so why not make it more "official"
since we are back-incorporating some of the tricks :)

*hrm* Im wondering now how many other little "tricks" are invalid that
most of the clients allow :)

What I said was that the dislike of a browsers display of a certain
HTML+ construct is not sufficient a reason to change the use of that
construct. I agree, if we can give clients hints to improve rendering
of our documents that is a good thing. If you want no space after a H*
(before the next block) that is property of the H*, and can neatly be
handled with parameters of an H*, as Dave suggested.

Chris Lilley wrote "the rule is clearly a top line, a part of the title",
and I can see that. Maybe an <H1 rule=bottom> would do this?

What I want to prevent is the HR being used in another way than as a
block separator. Something like "<H1>Hi<Hr>there</H1>" strikes me as
abuse, and your proposed change to the DTD would allow that.

Yes, thinking about this, this could be a better way to go.  A way of
turning off the white space above or below the header would be nicer
perhaps. It would also enable a few other things to be done easily too.

.... Yeah, a lot more flexible at the same time as being more "correct".

@ What I want to prevent is the HR being used in another way than as a

*grin* Just tried it in Lynx and Mosaic and erm it works... or breaks so
to speak. 

So what would the additional rules be then?

<H# rule=bottom> 	miss out whitespace under a header?
<H# rule=top>	 	miss out whitespace above a header?

That would accomplish things quite nicely I guess. And again as usual,
backwards compatibility wont be affected. :)

Subject: cataloguing-typically done
content-length: 747

hi, my name is Valere

I am currently a MLS student at Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts.
For my library cataloguing class, I am assigned to write on how cataloguing
is typically done in an acaedemic library from another country.  If anyone
can assist me, it would be much appreciated.  Here are some questions, I 
have to include in my paper:

	1. What cataloguing codes are used?
	2. What types of subject access are prevalent?
	3. Is OPACS widespread?
	4. Are there cooperative cataloguing efforts?
	5. Is networking common?


Unfortunely, the assignment is due 3 May 1994. Any information can be forward
to this fax number: (413)-782-7342.

Thank-you for any assistant you can give me.

How do the line break tags (<BR> and <L>) fit in with the pararagraph
container?  I can see authors using these tags to control the appearance
of their document using their favourite browser, but losing the
structure of the document.

To give a specific example consider a document containing a list of 
people in an orgnisation

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Staff List</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Prime Minister</H2>
<P>John Smith</P>
<H2>Ministers</H2>
<P>Douglas Hurd</P>
<P>Kenneth Baker</P>
...

The author on seeing this rendered as:

Prime Minister

John Major

Ministers

Douglas Hurd

Henneth Baker

may be tempted to write:

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Staff List</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Prime Minister</H2>
<P>John Smith<BR>
<H2>Ministers</H2>
<P>Douglas Hurd<BR>
<P>Kenneth Baker<BR>
...

or

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Staff List</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Prime Minister</H2>
John Smith<BR>
<H2>Ministers</H2>
Douglas Hurd<BR>
Kenneth Baker<BR>
...

These may look nicer, but the definition of the paragraph is lost.

Any comments?

Brian,

The <L> element was dropped last November, so we are left with <BR>.
The BR element is merely used to force a line break - it doesn't end
the current paragraph. I am also considering adding attributes to
the <P> element to allow authors to disable word wrap and collapsing
of white space.

HTML+ browsers will automatically infer missing paragraph elements so:

        <H2>Prime Minister</H2>
        John Smith<BR>
        <H2>Ministers</H2>

will be interpreted as if the author had given:

        <H2>Prime Minister</H2>
        <P>John Smith<BR></P>
        <H2>Ministers</H2>

By my working DTD, sgmls says:

sgmls: SGML error at test.html, line 10 at ">":

(by the way... just go grab the thing and build it... then you can
answer these questions yourself!!!)

Where does it say this in the spec? I don't think any HTML spec says
_exactly_ how HTML is to be rendered. Seems reasonable to me that an HR
following an Hn might be rendered without intervening space if you
so desire -- you just need a smart enough renderer, I guess.

Not in the near term... my take on the DTD I'm spinning is: if it works
today, fine. If not, it goes on the shelf...

As for the future... then question is: what's the structural significance
of an <HR>? Let's say it's to separate sections, like the old <P> used
to separate paragraphs. Then what's it doing inside a header? If you want
big rules under your header, I'd be more inclined to use
	<H1 STYLE="RULE-BELOW">...</H1>

Or, better yet, let's say that HR has _no_ structural significance...
it's just decoration. Then I'd rather see a processing instruction, like:

	<H1>...<? hrule></H1>

which can be written:

	<H1>...&hr;</H1>

if we introduce:

	<!ENTITY hr "<? hrule>">

into the DTD. Same goes for <BR>... let's define it as having _no_
structural significance, and henceforth write:

	line1 &br;
	line2 &br;

as a short form of

	line 1 <? linebreak>

This would be overloading the HR tag to have a new meaning in addition
to "big visible thing that separates sections... like \sectd in RTF."
If you want to be able to express this, we need to
	(1) put more presentation info in the DTD
	(2) introduce a set of processing instructions to represent
		"decorations" like this
	(3) develop a stylesheet mechanism

My preference is (1), as a short-term solution on the road to (3).

Could you give a specific citation? If it's really in there, I'll take it
out in the next revision. "Typical rendering" suggests are part of the spec...
rendering edicts are not.

What a contradiction!!! "make this change" when describing "current practice"!!
Current practice includes current browser implementations.

Blech... why put all this in the DTD? Are we abandoning the idea
of representing some sort of abstract structure in favor of developing
yet another way to encode a picture of a document?

Processing instructions and style sheets, dude. It's the only way to go.

This is just a way to render headers! I doubt there are any <HR>'s

Yes... it's a scary thought. That's why I'm developing a test suite.
This one will definitely go in there.

But it does mean changes to the DTD... If you want to stick any old
presentation info at all in your docs, you can do processing instructions
all over the place without changing the DTD. So for example, if I'm
writing an HTML->xxx converter, and the page breaks aren't coming out
right, I can add:

	<? pagebreak>

to my document and hack up my converter to look for "pagebreak"
processing instructions.  It will still parse by the same DTD.
(adding arbitrary attributes requires a change to the dtd) A
proliferation of slightly incompatible processing instructions is not
nearly such a mess as a proliferation of slightly incompatible DTDs.

This last one is actually what I'd prefer to see, except that the
two paragraphs should have <p> start tags, and the BR element
should be a processing instruction:

<H2>Prime Minister</H2>
<p>John Smith<?BR>
<H2>Ministers</H2>

No kidding... about 100 message on P as a separator vs. a

No... </p> can be left out just like </li> and </dt>.
But the consensus I hear is that P is a container.

Note Well: This makes an HTML+ browser a NON-CONFORMING sgml parser.
My current compromise is
	(1) p is a container, but...
	(2) if you forget the <p> start tag, the text is just floating
	around in the <body> element... it's not in any particular P element.
e.g.:

	<h1>head</h1>
	text
	<p>more text
	<h2>head</h2>
	<p>more text

is parsed as:

	<body>
		<h1>
	 	head
		</h1>
         	text
		<p>
			more text
		</p>
		<h2>
	 	head
		</h2>
		<p>
			more text
		</p>
        </body>

SPACEJUMP and TEXTSEARCH are attributes of an object, not methods.
I have suggested in the past that they be moved into a more generic
attribute specifier but I haven't seen any change in the spec yet.
TimBL, what do you think?

The server should use the URL to disambiguate whatever it needs to disambiguate:
	GET /place-order?...	form
	GET /visual-index?...	spacejump
	GET /data?...		text search
	GET /library?...	library-style search (a=author, t=title, s=subject)
	GET /database?...	SQL search
	GET /listing?...	regular expression
	etc, etc.

Subject: Re Various HTML q's
content-length: 1719

I wouldn't want to demote HR and BR from elements to PI's;
you can't fix the contents of the PI in the DTD, so you
can't guarantee consistency in instances.  One person
will have <?hrule> where the next has <? h-rule>, etc.

I agree that style sheets are the way to go; and one might
consider HTML+ as a working plan for what browser functionality
must be described in a useful style sheet.  

Entities are slightly more attractive than PIs, as their
names may be constrained, but in either case you can't
restrict where they may be used in an instance, and this is
something it may be desirable to do with HR and BR.  Though
I'm not sure why.  Maybe that's a good test for candidacy
for entityship, whether something may be rendered if it
appears anywhere.

A more economical solution to the wants of this user, in terms
of simple elements, would be to request browser developers
to put less white space above their HRs and let the user put it 
in with a <P> if desired.  

The Prime Ministers example is perhaps not well marked up.  If
the intention is to get:

PRIME MINISTER
  John Smith

MINISTERS
  Douglas Hurd
  Kenneth Baker

then this is a DL, or a set of headings, each followed by a UL.
If you don't want it displayed that way (that's the browser's
style for this structure, remember), why not just say it in
prose instead of typography?  "The Prime Minister, John Smith,
and the Ministers, Douglas Hurd . . ." or something of the sort.
If this is an exercise in display typography, then you're on
your own with any DTD.  Or find a browser that accepts B 
and I, etc, within PRE.

Then you don't disagree.

I didn't say *how* you decide that "/place-order" is a form, I just said
that you do.  I don't care if you hardcode it, look up some attribute,
call the GET method of the object, or ring up your mom and ask.

All of those are viable implementations (although the latter has some
nasty delay proporties).  Most (probably all) of the servers (certainly
CERN, NCSA, and Plexus) currently use some form of #2 (like you suggest)
but #3 is actually the superior implementation (because it can easily
emulate 1, 2 and 4).  I am working on converting Plexus to #3-style in my
copious free time.

Hello www-talk people!

I use the latest release of CERN httpd, 3.0 pre1.

My config file is the same that i use with the release 2.18, but i have a 
problem. The httpd can get the uid from the passwd. Why? Whats the problem?
My httpd.error is too big now!

Thanks in advance.

A stupid bug from my part.  I made pre2 available which fixes this and
a couple of other problems.

For anybody who got all excited by this message -- I am not officially
announcing either httpd 3.0pre1 or pre2, and hope it to be used only by
beta testers who are ready to face possible problems with this version.

Hi,

1.) I'm quite new at this, but I assume either a CGI script or a client side
program can be written to transfer any file from the client to the server
executing only HTTP commands.  Is this correct?  Are there any plans to build
this capability into HTML servers and browsers?  I'm thinking of business
applications in which the server (a business) wants to receive documents
electronically from clients running HTML browsers on a variety of platforms.
Has this been discussed here before?

2.) I've run into a problem when executing a "popen" command from a CGI script.
In some cases, the client does not see the response created by the CGI script.
Instead, he is asked to store it as a file on his machine.  See the details
below if you're interested and you care to comment and help.

Thank you.

Ernesto


Problem with popen:
-------------------
I'm using NCSA httpd 1.1 and NCSA Mosaic-2.2a on a Sun Sparcstation 1 with
SunOS 4.1.2.

I have a simple CGI script written in C that executes an "ftp" command to get a
file from a client-specified machine to the server machine.  The script is
executed as a result of submitting a form with method POST.  The relevant code
(without error checking) is:

...
   printf("Content-type: text/html%c%c",10,10);
...
   printf("<H1>FTP request:</H1>");
...
   ftpcom  = (char *) malloc(20);  /* allocate string for ftp command */
   sprintf(ftpcom, "ftp %s", machinename);  /* put ftp command in string */
   fp = popen(ftpcom, "w");       /* send ftp command */
   fprintf(fp, "%s%c", username, 10);  /* login at remote machine, under ftp */
   fprintf(fp, "%s%c", password, 10);  /* 10 is a newline character */
   fprintf(fp, "cd %s%c", directory, 10); /* go to correct directory */
   fprintf(fp, "get %s /tmp/%s%c", filename, filename, 10); /* get file */
   fprintf(fp, "quit%c", 10); /* quit ftp */
   pclose(fp);  /* close pipe */
   printf("Command:  %s  was executed<p>%c", ftpcom, 10); /* tell client ftp
done */
   free(ftpcom);
...

(You can substitute every "%c" with a "\n" and eliminate every ",10", with the
same results.)

The code executes fine: the file is retrieved to the server.  However, the
client does NOT see the response created by the CGI script in his/her Mosaic
browser.  Of course, (s)he is supposed to see:

FTP request:
Command:  ftp bomb  was executed

INSTEAD, the client sees a window pop up: "NCSA Mosaic: Save Binary File to
Local Disk", and (s)he is asked to specify a path and file name.  The file that
gets retrieved is the HTML document that is supposed to be the response.  It
contains:

<H1>FTP request:</H1>Command:  %s  was executed<p>

If I delete every "%c" and ",10" from the code above, the user DOES see the
response appear in his/her Mosaic browser, but of course, the ftp command
fails.  Other commands that do not require additional input, like "lpr",
execute fine and the client gets a correct response.  For example:

   printcom = (char *) malloc(40);
   sprintf(printcom, "/usr/ucb/lpr -P%s /tmp/%s", printername, filename);
   fp2 = popen(printcom, "r");
   printf("Command:  %s  was executed<p>%c", printcom, 10);
   pclose(fp2);
   free(printcom);

This causes no problems.  So the only thing that makes the CGI response to the
client fail is the newline character in the "fprintf(fp, "...\n",...);"
commands.

I've also tried using: "printf("Location:..." instead of
"printf("Content-type:" at the top of the CGI script, with exactly the same
results.

Is this a bug in httpd?  In Mosaic?  Has anybody seen this before?

Thank you in advance.

Clarification:

On the popen problem, when I said:

"If I delete every "%c" and ",10" from the code above, the user DOES see the
response appear in his/her Mosaic browser, but of course, the ftp command
fails."

I meant every %c in the fprintf commands.  The %c's in the printf commands
stay.  So it is only the newlines in the fprintf commands, that get sent to
ftp, that fail.

 Hello,

 I don't run NCSA http, but CERN httpd and I don't know if there is a
difference between this 2 servers.

 The following C source actually work well, with CERN httpd 2.18 and Mosaic
2.4, on a Sun OS 4.1.3

 ------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

char *machinename = "moulon";
char *username = "ftp";
char *password = "decoux@moulon.inra.fr";
char *directory = "/pub/www-acedb";
char *filename = "README";

main()
{
  char *ftpcom;
  FILE *fp;
  
   printf("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n");
   printf("<H1>FTP request:</H1>\n");

   ftpcom  = (char *) malloc(20);  /* allocate string for ftp command */
   sprintf(ftpcom, "ftp -n %s%c", machinename,10);  /* put ftp command in string */
   fp = popen(ftpcom, "w");       /* send ftp command */
   fprintf(fp, "user %s %s%c", username,password, 10);  /* login at remote machine, under ftp */
   fprintf(fp, "cd %s%c", directory, 10); /* go to correct directory */
   fprintf(fp, "get %s /tmp/%s%c", filename, filename, 10); /* get file */
   fprintf(fp, "quit%c", 10); /* quit ftp */
   pclose(fp);  /* close pipe */
   printf("Command:  %s  was executed<p>\n", ftpcom, 10); /* tell client ftp
done */
   free(ftpcom);
}

Hi,

I have a question.
Is there a search-engine to search entire WWW space?
like Archie in FTP infomation space and Veronica in Gopher space.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: WWW Proxy information
content-length: 2644

Many of you already know about the application level proxy design developed
by Kevin Altis, Ari Luotonen, and Lou Montulli. However, I thought I should
shed some more light on the work.

Since February, 1994, firewalls have been "safely permeable" for World Wide
Web (WWW) clients via an application level proxy. Proxy support is built
into popular Web clients such as Lynx and Mosaic and works across all
operating systems, not just Unix. The hypertext server developed at CERN,
cern_httpd, provides seamless external access to HTTP, Gopher, WAIS, and
FTP. Thanks to standard proxy support in the clients, and the wide
availability of the cern_httpd proxy server, anyone behind a firewall can
now have full Web access through the firewall host with minimum effort and
without compromising security. The cern_httpd also supports caching so it
is of interest to users that aren't behind firewalls as well. A paper on
WWW Proxies will be presented at the first WWW conference in Geneva at the
end of May. An electronic version is available at
<URL:http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proxies/>.

This is an open standard and as such we hope to publish an RFC and
standardize a proxy port number through the Internet authority.

Clients supporting the proxy: Lynx, X Mosaic, Win Mosaic, Mac Mosaic
(unreleased), Emacs WWW browser, CERN line mode browser. If you are a
client writer, and your program isn't on this list, but you support the
proxy, please let us know along with a URL to your client documentation.
You can also contact me for information on adding proxy support, it is
really easy. A full list of clients supporting the proxy is on the
Reference page of the Proxy paper.

This message was not intended as an ad, but I am soliciting direct feedback
from you so that I can find out which clients support the proxy which I may
have missed. I also want to find out which vendors are shipping proxies
that are based on the application level proxy mechanism. These may be based
on the cern_httpd, work as Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, or
something else entirely. At one time, I had gotten email from some of the
firewall vendors indicating their support, but I haven't heard from any of
them in a while. Finally, if you or your organization, corporation, etc. is
using the application level proxy I would like to hear from you. Please
email me directly and I'll summarize for the list in a few weeks.

If you have concerns about application level proxies in general or our
solution specifically, then please raise them on this list rather than
emailing me directly so that we can all participate in the discussion.

Thanks,

ka

Just a quick question -- could you clarify if authors of interactive  
pages (POST FORMs) need to do anything in order to prevent unintended  
caching in this system?  Or is this handled automatically?  Thanks!

The FORM itself could be cached depending on the settings on the proxy
server for a site as could the results, but in general, the *results*
wouldn't be cached because results wouldn't have Last-modified or Expires
meta-information and the default caching time for HTTP results without
those meta-fields is 0. I'm currently experimenting with a default
expiration of 15 minutes to an hour or so, to see if it makes a difference
to users.

OK, so it sounds like all CGI output really does need to have Expires  
meta-information added in order to be fully compatible with proxying.

What I understand you to be saying is that the proxy server's caching  
behavior is based only on the meta-information fields and on the URL  
-- not including POST query data! -- that generated the page.  And  
that furthermore, lack of meta-information results in  
server-dependent behavior.  Both of these are quite reasonable, but  
imply that every CGI script needs to preemptively expire its output.

Presumably it would be OK to add a fixed date which is guaranteed to  
be in the past, like:
	Expires: Sunday, 01-Jan-00 00:00:00 GMT
Is that right?

Well, every CGI script doesn't NEED to have Expires, since the default that
most proxies will use is to never cache items that don't have Expires or
Last-modified information (CGI scripts).

Based on Last-modified and Expires. Your POST query information going to a
remote server is never cached. The results of a POST or simply a cache
possibility. Content only has effect based on size, since a cache can use
data size to determine whether an item should be cached or for how long.
For example, I don't cache things over 16MB (Internet Talk Radio), even
though I have a very large cache on our proxy. Keep in mind that how the
cern_httpd caches today is not the only way to cache either and that other
proxies to come, say that people on this list write might cache
differently.

Hmm, I suppose that might make sense. That should override any proxy settings.

In general I wouldn't worry about adding Last-modified or Expires to your
CGI scripts. What I do encourage is adding Expires information that
supports caching if applicable. For example, if you have a database that is
updated and reindexed at 2:00 GMT every day, then when you send the results
of query, you know that the results are good until the next index at 2:00
GMT, so that can go into the Expires meta-field. This applies to many of
the CGI queries on the Web today.

This seems a problem with all of the implementations:
The file:... URL is used both for local files and remote ones.

I'd like to support users who want to test out their HTML documents
via local files, but have them go thru the proxy server for non-local
files. However, if you set up file_proxy to be your proxy server, you
won't get local file access; if you don't, it won't try to proxy
access even when `file:' is treated as `ftp:'.

I've patched this in my local copies of Mosaic and lynx through a
rather ugly hack, and I'm not currently using the proxy version of
emacs (having proxy-ized that in a different way).

I suppose I wouldn't need to do this if there were a supported
URL localfile:... in all of the browsers; then we could deprecate
`file:' by just making it equivalent to `ftp:'.

Yes... this gets a quick-and-dirty award for high utility/diff-line
ratio...

But the long-term solution is to merge the URL scheme:
and MIME access-type namespaces. In MIME, localfile is spelled
"local-file", and anonymous ftp is spelled "anon-ftp". They
also define "afs" and "mail-server". We should deprecate "mailto:"
in favor of "mail-server" for the same reasons.

There's a wealth of experience and knowledge built up in the MIME
standardization process. No reason not to use it.

file://localhost/path is not proxied at least by Lynx.
file://host.domain/path is treated just like ftp://host.domain/path. This
is how it should work in clients. I know that Win Mosaic does not handle
this case, so file:// references are currently broken in Win Mosaic.

I'm sure Lou will step in here to say more about clients...

If SPACEJUMP and TEXTSEARCH are attributes of an object and not 
methods --- what are we going to do if we move from URLs to URNs?
Then every URN is an object with an associated attribute.
Will there be different URNs for "get me a document" and 
"search in a document"?

Can a server disambiguate this:

	GET /12345?....

"12345" is an URN, not a path to an object.

Whatever the object and however it is referred to (URL, URN)
by the time a search/spacejump has to be performed the server
does have the actual object and the object has the necessary
information about what to do with it.

Isn't URN translated to a URL such that when a server gets a
request it is still a URL?  And even if a URN is requested the
server does have to know which object it is => can find out
what kind of query it is.

Until the time you get to the object itself you don't have to
know if its a spacejump or a textsearch anyway.

	I,  for one,  would rather not.   Maybe I'm anal, 
or maybe I'm just lazy,  but I'd like to keep those terse names. 
Don't deprecate,  fix!

When you resolve a URN you will get back a set of URLs with varying
attributes, the browser must pick one of them and use it in the normal way.

Erm,

Maybe Im having a mental block this morning or summin' but erm, can
someone refresh my mind between a URN and a URL and the mapping again :)

Depends on how much emphasis you want to put on the exactly. True you will not 
find "render this heading in Palatino demiblog 14.7 point with 3 point leading 
and +4.7% kerning"

Or rendered on a different page, or upside down, or in white on white 
background. So you cvan make no assumptions at all, is what you are saying. I 
think not.

Are you referring to the spec you are producing, or the official CERN one, btw?

As I said, I was going from memory. I suspect I had remembered 

  Heading elements in HTML
  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Headings.html

"The rendering software is responsible for generating suitable vertical white  
 space between elements, so it is NOT normal or required to follow a heading 
 element with a paragraph mark."

and

"When writing documents, you should assume that whatever is done it is designed 
 to have the same sort of effect as the styles above."

though I may have made those quotes stronger in the remembering. But I feel thay 
the second quote there supports my position. Yes, renderings will differ, but 
you can assume that Hn elements _will_ be rendered as titles.

<? rant>
I also feel that the world has moved on a ways since CERN started the WWW 
project. All this insistence on "we have absolutely no way of knowing what a 
renderer will do with this" reminds me of the GKS specification. When it was 
first being written, graphics output devices were so massively variable in 
capabilities - like, some could only erase the whole screen, not parts of it - 
that saying nothing about presentation  was the only way. By the time the spec 
came to be published, things has settled down. Raster graphics were standard and 
widely available, as was colour.

We can now assume at least a bitmapped screen, can we not? And a PostScript 
printer or some approximation thereto? The major platforms - Unix with X, PCs 
with Windows and Macs with the Mac interface - and also the minor ones (OpenVMS 
with X, Atari ST and Amiga) all provide this. It has become standard. Bending 
over backwards to support a 40 column caps-only text terminal seems a lot of 
hassle for little gain. This is the 90s, not the 70s, or didn't we learn 
anything?

I think maybe you read this too fast ;-)

Make this change _to _the_DTD_ which is what you are doing:

are you not? To document current practice? Such as, for example, the fact that 
at least two browsers support an HR inside an Hn

That's what I thought you were saying.

Excellent! Even clearer, even less ambiguous. So to comply with your stated aim 
of making a DTD that describes current practice, current browser 
implementations, if the current revision of your DTD does not support this then 
you would have to change it, would you not. I see no contradiction here (and I 
suspect you do not either, now)

Hmm, tell that to all the people with text only terminals in their offices
who have to use lynx or WWW.  And there are a fair few thousand of those. 
Also those bitmapped screens vary wildly in their capabilities; my little
Mac Classic has a 1 bit deep bitmapped display whereas the Sun I'm typing
this on has 24 bit colour (and is a damn sight bigger to boot).

The one thing we learnt (hopefully) from the 70's was to target the core
of a protocol to the widest user base possible.  If TCP/IP only ran on the
equivalent of modern PCs and workstations, I wonder whether it would have
taken off so much?

No actually. I got over 547 Lynx accesses yesterday on my server.
They didn't have a bitmapped browser.

<? /rant>

So what exactly are you trying to say? You want to stop writing
HTML(+) and start shipping bitmapped pages around? Or you want to come
up with a page description language that describes it's output down to
the pixel? For both approaches technologies exist, use them if that's
what you want.

Anyway, how this relates to the HR in H? debate I completely miss.

Well, if we supported style-sheets in documents, we could come close. (See:
http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/.www-talk-1993q2.messages/443.html)

I'm pretty convinced that we will not be able to provide anything the 
publisher really can use until we can offer them control over presentation.

Every publisher I have dog and ponied Mosaic to has loved it ... until I 
resize the window or change the font -- at which point they run screaming 
and shouting out the door, never to be seen again. (Well, not quite that 
bad, but you get the idea.)

Subject: Resource discovery, replication (WWW Announcements archives?)
Date: Tue, 03 May 1994 15:21:00 -0500
From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 5510


Is www-announce and/or comp.infosystems.announce archived? I keep a
lot of copies of announcements, thinking "someday I might want to look
at that..." and I'd get rid of my local copies if I knew I could
replace them if I wanted to...

It seems to me that a database of these articles, with a WAIS search
index, would be an extremely valuable resource discovery
application. Possibly more useful than databases currently built by
knowbots such as WWWWorm, AliWeb, Veronica, etc.

It would be even better if the messages were written in html and
tagged with MIME-Version: 1.0 and Content-Type: text/html (or even
better yet: multipart/alternative, with text/plain first and text/html
as an attachment...), so that the links could be interpreted reliably,
but for now, I'll settle for copying links out of the announcements by
hand (or having tools pick them out by heuristic parsing...)

If there is no archive of these messages, I will be very disappointed.
And I would encourage anyone who already has resources (disk space,
tools, time, etc.) for archiving newsgroups to please do this.

Hmmm... about maintenance... it's not really feasible to expect sites
that are going down to send out notification; Nor is a centralized
polling strategy... perhaps a hierarchical polling strategy would
work...

But my favorite idea for this problem is a broadcast strategy: (This
could possibly even be a candiate for the whole URN/URC administration
problem).  We could deploy a set of conventions like FAQ posting,
where WWW server sites (be they HTTP, gopher, ftp, WAIS...) post an
announcement via USENET periodically, summarizing their status and
contents. The article would go to the typically relavent newsgroups,
plus a special well-known newsgroup, say news.resources (much like
news.answers).

This newsgroup could be used in the typical news applications:
newsreaders, web browsers, etc.

But beyond that, it allows a distributed solution to the resource
discovery problem: Any site could build an index of available internet
resources just by archiving news.resources, indexing the contents, and
expiring old articles.

Let's see if this idea meets the requirements of an internet
distributed application:

* Portability: It's as portable as UNENET news. You don't get much
more portable than that. And for sites that don't want the full burden
of USENET news administration, it should be simple to implement scaled
down applications that only receive news.resources.

* Scalability: It seems scalable to me. Witness FAQ distribution as
evidence.

* Security: it's only as secure as USENET news, but PEM (Privacy
Enhanced Mail) techniques can be layered on top to provide
authentication of announcements through digital signatures, and
privacy of announcements through encryption.

* Reliability: hmmm... how often do news articles get dropped? And
even if an article gets dropped, the fault only lasts until the next
time the resource is announced. Seems suitably reliable and fault
tolerant.

It's fairly important that the contents of the articles can be
processed by machine: a method for following references from the
articles to the resources themselves must be well-defined. Plain text
messages containg URL's should be deprecated in favor of articles that
use MIME to indicate text/html, application/wais-source,
message/external-body, etc. body parts.

This could also be used as a way of distributing information about
replicated data. A mirror archive site could post a summary of its
contents, with (a) references to its own contents(A), and (b)
references to the original materials that it mirrors(B), and (c) a
machine-readable indication that A is a copy of B. Then any client
looking for any part of B that also has access to c can try looking at
A if it's closer or more available.

In order to exploit this, we need agreement between clients and
servers (read: specifications) about what it means for one reference
to refer to "part of" what another references refers to. e.g.. the fact
that
		ftp://host/dir1/dir2/file1
is part of:
		ftp://host/dir1
must be part of the specification, if we're to use URLs as references.
(Plug: This is why I think URLs should be explicitly hierarchical.)

We also need clients to have access to a database of these "A is a
copy of B" factoids. I think we should extend HTML to express this,
ala:

	See <A HREF="http://host1/dir1/dir2/file">more info</A>
	<REPLICA ORIGINAL="http://host1/dir1/" COPY="ftp://host2/dir3/">

Then, any client that parses this document would know that it can
retrieve http://host1/dir1/dir2/file as ftp://host2/dir3/dir2/file
if it prefers. It could also scribble that REPLICA factoid into a
database for use in other queries. It can also scribble the factoid
away in memory for use in other queries.

It's kinda like the way many clients look for
	setenv wais_proxy=http://nearby.proxy/
and learn to make proxy queries.

In this same way, proxy servers could learn about all sorts of
replicas and proxy servers just from documents that pass through
them. The factoids are subject to forgery, but so is any other info in
an HTML document, and the same sorts of authenticity techniques
digital signatures...) apply.


Nify, huh? I think so... I think I'll code it up and give it a try...

Given that RTF has styles, is renderable on dumb terminals and
wunderbar Gulag 5000 workstataions, should we think about supporting
the WinHelp extensions to RTF within our WWW browsers?  Most word

it does all the whizzy things people want HTML+ to do ...

There is an archive of comp.infosystems.announce at
ftp://ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pub/comp/usenet/comp.infosystems.announce/
Look at :INDEX for a list of "filename -> subject"

True! We had one for comp.archives (or better still have a really out of date)
but the problem still is to keep it uptodate. This is not a problem with
c.i.a right now, but it has been with c.a. The size of the database was
growing really fast and there was the question which timeframe should
be honoured ... 6 month? 1 year? 2 years? Within 2 years you have about
10 - 20 announcements for some software packages with makes it hard to
find the most recent one, but it's a hard job to delete the elder ones.

I also have a - not publicly available - mailfolder of all www-announce
messages from within a year or so.

Hmmm ... this is exactly the same idea thats behind ALIWEB and IAFA,
isn't it? So why have a new one?

I think we should really go away from "mirror" as known by now.
The solution used by caching HTTPds right now is IMHO the more
efficent and more transparent. And you always have the information
where you got it from and a kind of expiry mechanism.
I really hate all those sites "mirroring" e.g. Xmosaic documentation
or the like. It is NEVER accurate and uptodate und you NEVER know
whether this is a selfmade or a mirrored.
Using caches solves the problem of e.g. slow links and is really
still kind of a pointer to the original.

I am currently working on a caching-only server, that would also
allow for some hierachy in caching. This would completely solve the
problem without having the client to know about net topology and
replications.

The situation with www.ncsa.uiuc.edu just got more bizar.

1) for little more than  week now I cannot get any html page
   from ncsa. (which used to work before, and on my site nothing changed)
2) while I cannot get anything from chem.rug.nl I *can* get it 
   indirectly via cc.ukans.edu (which I use very little to test how
   a page looks on a line mode browser)

so it has nothing to do with the server being busy or so, ncsa simply
refuses me to connect to www.ncsa.uiuc.edu (even telnet to port 80
results in: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

ping to ncsa works, and so does traceroute, the ftp port number works too
(allthough on www.ncsa.uiuc.edu there is no anonymous ftp, nor did I expect
it, it was just another test to see if I could reach them)

What happened?

Subject: HTML+ for software documentation
content-length: 1441

To any HTML+ expert:

        As a member of a computer satellite modeling team, I've been asked
to investigate the feasibility of using NCSA Mosaic/HTML as a platform for
writing hypertext software documentation.  Currently the team's leader and
deputy leader are in a fierce debate arguing between Framemaker and LaTeX.
Both, however, are interested in Mosaic and it's possible application to
our work.

        Before today, I would have said a large-scale documentation project
would have been difficult using and HTML format due to restictions on image
inlaying and the lack of a convenient equation editor. Recently (this
morning), I've found mention of HTML+, as well as latex2html and WEBMAKER,
converters that create HTML files from LaTeX and Framemaker.  I thought
that perhaps these things might be the solution to our team's problem.

        I am currently looking for the most up-to-date information on
HTML+, especially regarding the status of an equation editor.  I've already
looked through
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html and
ftp://15.254.100.100/pub, but would like more information, such as how to
set up a HTML+ browser.  (My system administrator/UNIX demi-god just took
off for a two month vacation to Italy and I have only installed NCSA Mosaic
onto a Macintosh before!)

        Thanks in advance for any help you can provide,

Well, we (WIRED) would much rather have our information mirrored at a
specific site rather than cached around the world.  Data about frequency
of use and popularity of particular pages is important to us, as is
insuring that pages cached around the world are as up to date as possible. 
With official mirror sites we could insure that the data gets updated on a
regular basis (three times a week is good for us) and that access logs can
be forwarded to us for analysis.  

We have a semi-official mirror policy - I'll append it at the end of this
message.  It's purposefully fairly heavy-handed, as the documents people
are asking to mirror are quite valuable, and since our copyright is on
the *collection* of the articles anyways.  A couple places have asked 
about being mirrors, but after seeing our policy they didn't inquire 
further :)  We are interested though in possibly having a mirror in
Europe and the Orient - if you're interested let me know.  

	Brian


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have a pretty strict mirror site policy, since our copyright is
on the collection of articles.  But, we are interested in possibly
having a mirror, one in europe and one in the far east, but there
are certain conditions we need met to protect our interests and
copyright.  If you can meet the following, then you could be a
mirror.  Here they are:

1)  We need logs, sent to us weekly, of all the accesses to the
Wired part of your site.  We are very interested in traffic.

2)  You must have the complete mirror exactly as it appears on
our site, and it must be mirrored three times a week.  There are
mirroring tools being developed now that will make this an
easy thing to do, and will only transfer those files which have
changed.

3)  We need to have a login on your machine with write access
to the directory holding the copied files.

4)  Any additional services you think would be cool to add 
should be sent to us first, and we'll set them up on our
side (which will get mirrored to yours).

5)  Interactive forms and scripts should of course still point to
our machine, but you can run a local WAIS server if you want.

6)  You still have a pointer to our home page here at www.wired.com,
since we will be offering many extra things in the near future.

7)  We reserve the right to take any part of or all of the 
back issues out of publication on the net.

Great! Thanks. Hmmm... I wonder how many hops from hal.com to .de?

I dunno... Maybe I just need to play with/read about those systems
more. For some reason, they strike me as too centralized: there's the
per-site data, and there's the list of all sites. What's in-between?
How is the global list maintained?  Suppose I want an index of
resources related to biochemistry: can I build one? (with my strategy,
I can filter the articles however I want and build custom indexes)

But it only works if you know where to point your client to find a
proxy server! I'm trying to work out a way where clients can discover
"proxy caches" automatically, and proxies can find proxies, etc.

Yes: we need pointers to the original (or enough information in the
original reference to determine whether the cached data is the right
data, like dates and/or MD5 checksums) and audit trails.

Yes: hierarchy in caching is the key feature. I just thought I had an
idea for how to realize it. I didn't expect I had the only idea ;-)
I have to code mine up and try it out to really understand the issues.

In the last few weeks two "literate programming" tools authors have 
announced that they support output both in LaTeX and in HTML 
(using latex2html) [A literate programming tool lets you mix 
program documentation with the actual code. The tool is responsible 
for separating the documentation (for human consumption) and the 
code (for the compiler)].

Although the paper-based documentation that comes out (LaTeX) is good,
there are still some problems with the HTML output especially
with large files. Have a look at
http://info.desy.de/user/projects/LitProg/HTML.html
for more information and links to examples.

But if you are thinking about software documentation which is written
and maintained separately from the code then either one of latex2html 
or webmaker should do - it should come down to what you are most
comfortable with...

In ALIWEB the global list is maintained by a form for subscription,
and email for deletion (currently by hand). But, by having a
"standard" location for the per-site info any robot can go around
looking for that.

If you want an index of resources related to a particular topic you
can either use ALIWEB simple or form-based search to do it for you,
copy the data to your machine and do it locally, or even get the
list of hosts and go and get the information yourself in a standard
format.

How? How does the robot know where to go and look? And does each
robot have to search the entire space? With USENET news distribution,
you only need to talk to one neighbor. And he talks to his neighbors,
and so on, and so on... The whole idea here is to quit doing this
N^2 thing where all clients talk to all servers (or all robots scan
all servers...) and start doing some Nlog(N) style things.

Each of these is an all-or-nothing proposition: in the first
case, I have to locate an ALIWEB server with all the data in the
world on it (scalability test says: BZZZZT). Or I can copy
all the data to my machine (BZZZZT). Or I can get "the list of
hosts" (BZZZT) and do it myself.

With my broadcast strategy, I just set up a process that gathers new
articles and expires old ones. Server sites wouldn't necessarily renew
their announcements at the same interval, but let's say the maximum
interval for 95% of the sites is one month. Then after two months,
my database reaches steady-state. From then on, It maintains itself.

And its scalable: everybody has access to everything without anybody
having to do everything.

I didn't say it was the most efficient thing to do, just that it was
possible. The important thing about ALIWEB is that it is reasonably
efficient for the server, the server admin has a say about what stuff
is indexed, and the index is in a common format.  The star-shaped
gathering and the single indexing site haven't become a problem yet.

Sure, the current implementation of ALIWEB doesn't scale up forever.
The central data gathering might be a bottleneck, which can be solved
by a hierarchy of data gatherers, or as you suggest by broadcasting,
and the single database could be a problem too.

Regarding the scaleability, you still have "all the data in the world"
in a single machine, namely in the News spool area and in our
database, and you still have in effect "copied all data accross", with
NNTP instead of HTTP. So your first two bzzzzt's bite your own approach
too.

The big advantages I see in using NetNews to broadcast IAFA templates
are that you don't have to register explicitly, and that it is more
likely that a number of different sites will provide searcheable
indices for it.  Because it pushes rather then pulls there is little
overhead (although with If-modified-since this isn't a problem in HTTP
either), but you do burden people to push.

Security is a problem though, at least with ALIWEB I know that the
index comes from the server I just pulled it off, with NetNews that's
not so easy; yes PEM could help but then you are starting to make it a
complicated procedure. Also, because anybody can post the
signal-to-noise ratio will drop, but that may well be acceptable.

As you are going to end up with a large database, you do need some sort
of attribute-value schema so that you can search on something sensible.
I suggest that IAFA-like templates do that quite nicely.

Well, the data is all copied accross, but in a scalable way (not N^2).
But I thought I made the point that each site can filter the data,
thus eliminating the need to store everything on any one machine.

I guess it's the old time-versus-storage tradeoff: in my proposed
system, you can query the the whole database using only enough disk
space for one message -- but it will take you a month or so to conduct
your query. And you can configure your system for anything from that
to storing the whole database, thus allowing a global query in a
single local transaction.

In any case, my point about scalability is: each site makes the
trade between speed and storage independently, and no singe site
is burdened with any global responsibilities.

[Boring stuff where you agree with me deleted... :-]

You may believe that, and you may be right most of the time.
But there is no mechanism to ensure it. DNS
can be spoofed. TCP/IP is not inherently secure. In short, security-
minded folks won't be satisfied.

Sure... that's pretty much what I had in mind in the first place...
as long as they're explicitly tagged as such.

I have a program that runs as an httpd script and produces html from
database accesses. I would like to add a redirection capability that
would allow it to generate an URL, pass it to the appropriate server,
and relay the results back to its own client. To do this I presumably
have to embed the minimal httpd client functionality of URL-resolving
into my code.  I looked at Mosaic-2.4, and libwww2/HTTP.c seems to be
the relevant piece, but it depends on a lot of other code in this
module, and I would rather not have to include all of it if I
don't have to. Is there a bare-bones description of the client-side
of the httpd protocol anywhere?

Thanks. -Stan

There is nothing about ALIWEB that says you *MUST* gather the information
via robot retrieval.  I assure you that when the database get's too big
to man handle that other distribution schemes like your USENET
suggestion will get implemented.  An indexing scheme that can't support
multiple data sources isn't going to fly.

The real problem is that implementing the USENET scheme will take a fair
amount of work and effort while writting a simple 10 line shell/perl script
to go grab the data on command is very easy.  Who is going to implement
this?  If you do it then I'm sure it will get used.

Also, with your USENET scheme WWW server admins must *know* to post this
message every so often.  That in itself is an amazing barrier.  A solution
might be for the server itself to send email to remind the admin :-)
Maybe even offer to do it automatically.

ALIWEB itself suffers this same problem, admins must generate the index
entry for their site and until there is a tool that will do that
semi-automatically and is distributed with every server and *forces* the
admin to do it, then it isn't going to be as wide spread as it needs to be.

stan, check out http://cui_www.unige.ch/ftp/PUBLIC/oscar/scripts/README.html
for a list of handy perl routines including 'htget'.  i'm always thinking
in Perl mode -- forgive me. this may be helpful.

Lately, python is my favorite quick-and-dirty, but
precise programming language.

The cool think about python is that it's pretty easy
to grok, right out of the box. See for yourself:

	A couple of months ago,  I cooked-up a gem I call 'webcat'. 
This would do exactly what you want,  though ... uh ... I hadn't planned 
on giving it out anytime soon.   It doesn't use libwww,  and should! 
The idea was that any number of scripts could use this same thing 
to get stuff off the web. 
 
> Thanks. -Stan
 
	Webcat has another feature which I've wanted to mention 
for quite some time and never gotten around to:   The argument passed 
is treated as a local filename first,  webcat tries to open the object 
with open().   If that fails,  then webcat tries a readlink(). 
The result of readlink(), or argv[1] itself, is passed to the webbish 
parts of the code.   The idea is that you can have a sym-link like: 
 
		riceinfo -> http://riceinfo.rice.edu/ 
 
			and webcat will follow it. 
 
	This has interesting implications for all applications. 
If this trick were incorporated into a common open() used by other 
ordinarily local apps,  think of it!   Suddenly GNU EMACS and vi 
are both WWW editors  (almost).

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Best of the Web '94 Awards (at last!)
content-length: 1806

The nominees have been announced for the Best of the Web '94 Awards.
They can be found at:
http://wings.buffalo.edu/contest/

The awards are being given in 14 categories:
WWW Hall of Fame
Best Overall Site
Best WWW Browser

Best Educational Site
Best Commercial Site
Best Entertainment Site
Best Professional Site
Best Navigational Aid
Most Important Service Concept
Best Document Design
Best Use of Interaction
Best Use of Multiple Media
Most Technical Merit

each category has about 10 nominees (sorry, I couldn't narrow it any further
myself without showing bias).
-------------------------------------
The nominees are now open for public scrutiny, while I make some 
last-minute embellishments and the voting forms.  During this time, I 
would appreciate the following:
* Any corrections to information on the pages (i.e. false credit)
* Any embellishments from the nominees themselves, such as:
	- background/history/biographical information
	- instructions for using the service (if it's complex)
	- pointers to highlights of site

--------------------------------------
Here is the expected schedule of completion:

MAY 4-9: Public Viewing of Nominees, last-minute editions
MAY 10-24: Public Voting for Awards
MAY 26: Awards announced & trophies presented at WWW'94 in Geneva
MAY 27: Permanent awards exhibit displayed here
JUNE: Trophies mailed to absent award recipients

--------------------------------------
Sorry for the LONG delay.  I'm sure many of you gave up on me!

Hope this service will be of use to everyone.  I've been very impressed
by the nominees, and am sorry that I had to turn away so many.  The Web
is truly becoming a valuable resource, and I congratulate you all for
that accomplishment.

I realise this probably isn't exactly the right place for this question, but I'm
hoping somebody knows the answer anyway -

where do I get a copy of all ISO Character entity sets that were defined in
ISO 9573-1991? Most SGML tools seem to only come with the ISO 8879-1986 set.

Thanks,

Lauren Wood, law@step.de

PS: any good SGML email groups out there?

Hi,
My question may seem very elementary for most of you computer experts.  I=
 don't know too much about computers, but I have been asked to write a home=
 page in HTML.  I have read most of the information available and I know=
 about the commands to create headings, paragraphes, etc.  I also know that=
 Latex will convert the text into HTML.  I am using a Macintosh PowerBook=
 and I have access to Mosaic.  I don't know if I can use a normal word=
 processing software for typing in my home page or not. If yes, how can I=
 then convert it to HTML, and if no, how can I create a HTML document?  Can=
 I also include graphics like a logo in my document? If yes, how?

I thank you all in advance for your help

Exactly the Right Thing, IMHO :).  Centralized strategies, or the two-phase 
commit strategy in the relational database world, are needed when maximum 
reliability is one of the goals of the information system.  My impression is 
that there is enough redundancy arising from the structure of the Web (home 
pages having pointers to other home pages) that a small proportion of 
out-of-date information would not be much of a problem.  Meanwhile, the 
computing resource requirements should be much less under this scheme. 
 (Unfortunately this is based on hearsay, as our TCP/IP Internet connection 
is not due until summer.)

As far as security goes, <9405041228.AA24223@ulua.hal.com>:

Security mechanisms will evolve, eventually becoming as common as 
command-line shells.  Remember that the first FORTRAN compiler was a 
research project that took 7 or so man-years to complete (don't have the 
precise figures in front of me).  Now it is expected that an undergraduate 
can write a compiler with modern tools as part of a single-semester course. 
 As security is needed, it will be added.

Hi eric,

(and others with the same problem)

The problem has been resolved! For a long time I had an entry
for www.ncsa.uiuc.edu in my /etc/hosts (to save a round trip to the
nameserver over my slip line)
 
three people told me to remove that entry, and so I did. Instantly I
could reconnect to ncsa as I could before.
 
perhaps a short message on the meta-announcements in what's new should
mention this explicitly. 

I'm a happy user again!

:-)  (see I'm happy)

is there a way to take a .ps.Z extension

would i do that through addtype, or is there some other mechanism?

if it matters, i am using mosaic and httpd.

Subject: CERN httpd 3.0pre3 available
content-length: 10460


			   *  *  *  *  *

  CERN httpd is a generic hypertext server which can be used as a
  regular HTTP server running typically on port 80 to serve hypertext
  and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a firewall
  machine -- that provides access for people inside a firewall to the
  outside world.  When running as proxy httpd may be configured to
  do caching of documents resulting in faster response times.

			   *  *  *  *  *

CERN httpd 3.0pre3 is available, source code from:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/cern_httpd.tar.Z

This package includes EVERYTHING, so don't ftp the libwww.
Precompiled binaries are supplied for Sun4, Solaris, HP, NeXT,
NeXT-386, Decstation Ultrix and DEC OSF/1 under:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin

Precompiled binaries are in cern_httpd_3.0pre3.tar.Z, which also
includes a default set of icons (three new ones by Rainer Klute:
unknown has a ? in it, gzip is slimmer than compress, and doc looks
better now; thanks, Rainer!), and sample configuration files for
normal and proxy use, plus a template file containing all the
configuration directives understood by httpd (thanks to Sean Gonzalez
for it!).

For Sun4 there is also a cern_httpd_3.0pre3-lresolv.tar.Z which
contains an httpd linked with the -lresolv option.

Binaries for utility programs (htadm, htimage, cgiparse and cgiutils)
are in a separate tar packet: cern_httpd_utils_3.0pre3.tar.Z.

Compilation for other Unix platforms should not be very complicated.
I would be happy to receive diffs, if any, to make it compile for
other platforms.  Also binaries other than those already on
info.cern.ch are welcome.

VMS port is on its way!

                  CERN HTTPD 3.0 PRERELEASE NOTES 1-3

3.0 Prerelease 1
 
     * If-Modified-Since GET request now works correctly with proxy
       (client can do conditional GET/proxy can do conditional GET plus
       all the combinations of these).
     * Pragma: no-cache supported; by sending this header to the proxy
       the client will force it to refresh its cache from remote server.
       Pragma headers are also forwarded to the remote server.
     * Server now resets its state correctly when it receives the HUP
       signal (directory listing icons used to stop working).
     * -restart option - httpd will find out the actual server process
       number and send s HUP signal to it to make it reload its
       configuration files; note that httpd must still have the same
       configuration file command line parameters (-r options) as the
       actual server (so it finds out the ServerRoot and PidFile).
     * Now makes appropriate entry to error log when restarting.
     * Made common logfile format default, the old format can still be
       used with the LogFormat directive:
  
        LogFormat old
 
     * Multiple wild-card (asterisk) matching in configuration file
       works; it is a bit different from typical regular expression
       matching in that the wildcard matches the shortest possible
       amount of characters instead of the longest matching string; this
       is the best choise in most of the cases. Consider:
 
        Pass  http://*/*  /mirror/*/http/*
 
       Clearly the first asterisk should rather match only the hostname, and
       not the entire path except the filename.
     * Rules can now have asterisks and whitespace in them: precede them
       with a backslah; as a result also the backslash itself has to be
       escaped with another backslash.
     * The tilde character after a slash has to be explicitly matched:
 
        Map     /*      /foo/bar/*
 
       does not match user-supported directories, but:
 
        Map     /~*     /Webs/users/*
 
       does match them.
     * Fixed the problem that user-supported directories could not be
       mapped or Protect'ed.
     * Hostname matching made case-insensitive in access control/caching
     * Added suffixes .htm and .htmls to the default set of known
       suffixes.
     * Fixed some of the mysterious caching problems (all that were
       reported to me and that I could reproduce).
     * Made it possible to specify the various byte/kilo/mega sizes in
       cache configuration with letters after the number (so it's no
       longer necessary to remember if the default is kilobytes or
       megabytes):
 
        CacheSize       150 M
        CacheLimit_1    100 K
        CacheLimit_2    2 M
 
       The numbers still have to be cardinals.
     * Content-Length given for all documents, including
       (non-nph-)script responses, generated directory listings, error
       responses, all the documents retrieved over another protocol by
       the proxy (FTP, Gopher, ...), including HTTP responses from
       servers that didn't give it originally.
     * MaxContentLengthBuffer directive to specify the maximum bytecount
       for the proxy to buffer in order to find out the content-length
       for the client - content-length is always calculated for the
       logs, but the user migth interrupt the connection if nothing seems
       to be happening, even though it is the proxy that is just
       buffering the entire file in order to find out the content-length
       before actually sending it to the client.
     * Caching module now checks that it receives the correct
       content-length; if not it discards the cached document. This rules
       out the possibility to cache a truncated document from a timed out
       connection in 99.99% of the cases (0.01% comes from the fact that
       Plexus sends a timeout error message concatenated to the document
       and if so should happen that this produces exactly the correct
       content-length then there is nothing that can be done about it; in
       practice this never happens).
     * Made HEAD work always, even on proxy with other protocols (FTP,
       Gopher...).
     * PASV (Passive mode) in FTP now supported. It is no longer
       necessary to allow incoming connections above 1024 on the firewall
       host just to make FTP work. If PASV fails httpd will retry PORT.
     * Welcome messages from FTP servers get shown on top of the
       directory listings.
     * Fixed bug with old FTP files getting wrong date in the listing.
     * Gopher listings now have icons.
     * Proxy now reports unknown host errors appropriately.
     * Fixed encoding-decoding problems with directory listings.
     * Added ScriptTimeOut - scripts that do not finish in this amount of
       time will be killed by httpd. Default value is 5 minutes.
     * A /~username URL with an invalid username no longer causes an
       infinite redirection loop.
     * The two files missing in FTP listings are no longer missing (they
       weren't in 2.18beta, either).
     * Fixed a possible error condition that might cause the server to
       stop responding, or even die.
     * Server now resets its UserId and GroupId even when in gc-only mode
       (this solves problems with .cache_info files sometimes being
       unwritable to actual caching processes).
     * CacheAccessLog is now opened during startup while running as root
       to avoid opening problems. There is no longer logging to
       individual files according to remote hosts - all cache accesses
       are logged to this single file.
     * CacheOnly directive for specifying a set of URLs that should be
       cached (for cases when there are only a few sites that should be
       cached).
     * Added DELETE-Script directive for specifying the CGI script to
       handle DELETE method.
     * NoProxy directive to allow the proxy to do direct access to some
       servers instead of connecting to another proxy server (contains a
       list of domain names). This works exactly like the no_proxy
       environment variable on clients. (Thanks to Rainer Klute for the
       patch!) This is only necessary when running multiple proxy servers
       that connect to each other.
     * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused time directives to be parsed
       incorrectly (e.g. CacheDefaultExpiry).
     * Multilanguage addition to allow server to understand e.g. that
       British English is also English, and that the US citizens do
       understand it (thanks to Toshihiro Takada for the patch!).
     * Removed:
          + GcReqInterval and GcTimeInterval - not very good criteria to
            start doing garbage collection (GcDailyGc is better, giving
            the actual time to lauch gc)
          + cache access logging to individual logfiles according to
            remote host (wasted resources - a separate program is better
            for collecting this information from a single log file).
          + -a and -R options (never used).
          + BodyTimeOut replaced by ScriptTimeOut
          + includes from Makefiles (not supported by all the makes).
          + #elif preprocessor directive removed (wasn't supported by all
            the HP preprocessors)

3.0 Prerelease 2
 
     * ~username form understood with ServerRoot, Search, PutScript,
       PostScript, DeleteScript, AccessLog, ErrorLog, CacheAccessLog
       directives.
     * Opens cache access log only if caching is turned on.
     * Binary distribution now contains a template configuration file
       that has all the configuration directives understood by httpd
       (thanks to Sean Gonzalez for it!).

3.0 Prerelease 3

     * Unescaping bug fixed in news module (caused many articles to fail
       to be retrieved).
     * News module now gives appropriate error reponses for unavailable
       articles and non-existent news groups.
     * FTP and HTTP modules now give better error responses.
     * Fixed the cache access log to show the correct content-lengths.
     * GMT-to-localtime transformation works now on all platforms in
       caching (was broken on others than Sun).

If have a couple of Question/Suggestions concerning HTML Forms.
Since i have only been involved with WWW for a short time, these questions
might probably been asked several times. (Sorry but i need to know)

Is it Possible to put a formated Line of text into a scrolled list
(with select and option)? <pre> is ignored, an i haven't found another
way. 

Why isn't there an attribut like COLS in the TEXTAREA which would
define the width of the list ? It would make the layaout more readable
and uniform. For example if a script writes results of a
databasequery into a list. With no entries in the list the scrolled
list wouldn't look that strange as now. What would speak against it ?

Another question, why isn't it possible to have serveral submit-buttons
with different Actions (URLs) in one form,so those actions could use a
common input field or an selected field in a list?
  
Thanx in advance

Dear Listmaster and www-talk subscribers:
Shouldn't we have a www-talk FFAQ (F=friendly) posted in regular intervalls?
IM very HO it would be good to keep www-talk focused on future development
of HTML and HTTP, and not let it turn into a places where beginners ask
for instructions? It also might be a good idea to send some guidelines
together with the standard message the any new subscribient receives.  


Dear Negar Azmudeh:
You should try to find out about how to read news, and then subscribe
to the newsgroup "comp.infosystems.www". There you will find an FAQ (a list
of frequently asked questions and answers) and lot's of other information
on editors, converters and browsing tools.

Cheers,
Chris

I second that suggestion. I recommend allowing ACTION=url within
<INPUT type=submit ...>, with the ACTION-spec in the <FORM ...>
being used as a default for submit's with no ACTION. ACTIONs
more logically pertain to the buttons than the entire form.

In regard to ghostscript 2.6.1 and ghostview 1.0, don't forget to pick
up the ghostscript 2.6.1 fonts.

Ghostview, a Windows application which rides on ghostscript,
occasionally bombs if the necessary fonts are not found.

Aladdin Enterprises (specifically, Peter Deutsch) guarantees that 
the most current ghostscript distributions are at 
ftp.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghost.

The answer to this and many other questions is, "There's no good technical
reason why this feature is not present. There has simply been no resource
put into developing the feature."

You see: WWW is not a product. There is no commercial organization
whose business it is to write code in responses to customers' whining.
NCSA is the closest thing -- try whining directly to them. But unless
you're part of a market that they have motivation to serve, you can't
expect them to jump up and down.

Welcome to the world of "user-supported software."

I love it.

Contributions are welcome. Whining is not. I don't mean to be
unfriendly, but this mailing list is for discussion of future
technical developments in WWW. There are other channels
(comp.infosystems.www, Mosaic support from NCSA <pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu>,
etc.) for product-usage type questions.

The question you asked has been discussed before. This list is
archived (http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html).
You are expected to familiarize yourself with the material in the
archive before posting. Just like on USENET: one should ALWAYS (1)
read the FAQ (http://siva.cshl.org/~boutell/www_faq.html), and (2)
count to 10 before posting.

[Sorry if I'm overreacting, but www-talk is an extrememly valuable
technical forum for me, and when it deteriorates to Mosaic customer
support, I feel I must do something.]

WWW used to be exclusively user-supported software. The user base was
limited to those with the know-how to build, install, administer, and
maintain it.

But now, it's becoming something of a product. CERN, NCSA, KU, and
other institutions are packaging up binaries so folks don't have to
compile it. Companies are paying administrators to install and support
it onsite. (perhaps you have a local channel you could deal with...)
There's even -- look out -- documentation!

On the one hand, it's exciting to see WWW penetrate into such wide
markets. On the other hand, there's always a price to pay.

In any case, to summarize: www-talk is NOT Mosaic customer support.

I didn't mean to dismiss Mr. Clausnitzer's question altogether...
it appears that he has done his homework and is willing to contribute.
What I took for whining was really just broken English. I apologize.

I guess I'm just frustrated by the overwhelming demand for information
about WWW.

<SoapBox>

	But what REALLY frustrates me is that had we taken a more
	formal approach to designing WWW technology, many of these
	support issues would have been avoided.

	Unclear specifications lead to conflicting implementations
	which lead to confusing behaviour which leads to
	(1) zillioins of support questions,
	(3) lack of confidence in the technology, and
	(2) high cost of development and maintenance,
		due to the need to support past hacks and kludges

	When developing a new technology, one cannot expect to
	"get it right the first time," but there is no excuse
	for not investigating the existing body of relavent
	knowledge and applying it consistently.

	There is no excuse for not studying SGML before making
	modifications to HTML. I understand that SGML is obscure
	and the standard is nearly impenetrable. There is no
	excuse for that either, but what's done is done. There
	are other documents describing SGML. There is the excellent
	sgmls tool from James Clark. There is comp.text.sgml.

	HTML _is_ an application of SGML. Get used to it. There are
	costs involved: HTML is, because of this, inherently somewhat
	complex. But there are benefits as well, and from my
	experience, they outweigh the costs.
	
	When the HTTP developers embraced MIME and the technology
	framework of previous TCP-based protocols, (NNTP, FTP, SMTP),
	they became much more productive. They are able to experiment
	with a clear idea of which techniques are likely to conflict,
	and which techniques are independent, i.e. which techniques
	must be part of the common framework (the protocol) and which
	techniques can be left implementation-dependent.

	But I think some of the principals of MIME have been
	missaplied. The format for HTTP messages is called "www/mime"
	when it uses the syntax of the MIME "message/*" types.
	Why not "message/www" or "message/http"? This is not just
	an issues of the spelling of a name. It's a question
	of understanding the essential techniques of MIME.

	And the URL/URI/URN/UR* technology is not doing so well. URLs
	are a defacto standard. But, for example, witness the
	current confusion about file: versus ftp: versus local:
	The MIME external body access-type technique was developed
	several years ago. We should have adopted their names,
	and gone with ftp:, anon-ftp:, and local-file: a long time
	ago. The research behind WAIS doc-ids is also relavent,
	and I think we are missing some of its crucial components
	(copyright status and original-id).

	And if we are to evolve HTML technology from its current
	very-useful-but-far-from-sufficient state, we MUST apply
	more formal methods to abstract the essential techinques
	from the various applications. I suggest we take a serious
	look at the architectural-form techniques from the HyTime
	standard development, and develop (1) a set of WWW
	architectural forms for linking and navigation, and
	(2) a stylesheet mechanism so that the WWW linking and
	navigation techniques can be applied to a variety of SGML
	DTDs.

Whew! I needed that!

Subject: Anyone willing to set up a class on how to write HTML.

Is there anyone out there who is willing to help set up a class for
the Globewide Network Academy on how to write HTML?  Such a class
would be similar in spirit to the C++ and the Intro to the Internet
class which is now running.  Most of the work in setting up the class
would be to compile the various documents to HTML in one place.

To see more about the classes that have already been set up look at

	All this is true - but it was not so long ago when www-talk
basically *was* Mosaic customer support! If many of us hadn't griped
way back when, you wouldn't be seeing the same Mosaic line of browsers
today (but I'm not saying that we should start griping about it!).
	It was more fun when it was less commercial, but I suppose
this is the unfortunate, perhaps realistic evolution of things... *sigh*

participation by several hundred people at its monthly events.  Past
events have included presentations by leaders in the development of
the World Wide Web and its client interfaces, Wide Area Information
Service (WAIS), Internet infrastructure, commercial applications of
the Internet (e.g. CommerceNet), and so on.  All aspects of NIDR, from
technical details and software applications, through standards and
end-user applications are open topics of discussion.  SIGWEB is an all
volunteer run group welcoming participation from all interested
individuals.

Subject: WWW Photo Album Spider
content-length: 872

I have created a "WWW Spider" which creates a "PHOTO ALBUM" of pictures.

That is, say you know of a URL where there are many icons and images
stored in one directory.  You can use this utility to create a photo
album of the icons/pictures that are there.

The captions of these icons will be clickable, so that one can copy the
icons to your local machine.

Obviously, there are severe copyright issues that could arise from
this!

It is also good for putting a load on a server :-(.

I would like to hear the opinions of others as to the ethics and
legalities of such software.

content-length: 1748

Well, I think this is great... I am an artist and have art on WWW sites.
It seems that this program would be good for creating thumbnails of
pictures for my art which I can then add back to the www pages...
Am i right that the program can do this?

As for ethics and legalities... Well I think that in art you have
to be aware of the artist's desires and follow them. I am in a Virtual
Art Gallery on the WWW called OTIS (http://sunsite.unc.edu/otis/otis.html)
and when artists store things there, they also store information on
how they want their art/images to be treated and used. This is helpful
because artist can make their own choices instead of going with the 
choice of the gallery curator.

My art is freeart, and there are no restrictions on using it except
for:

	1. You include the README file with the images so that others 
	   know it is share art.
	
	2. That if you dramatically alter the image, please do not 
	   attach my name to it as it will not be art I have done....

	  One form of dramtically changing it would be to scribble on
          top of it with a image editor...

If you can't find my art on OTIS (due to the reconstruction we are
doing, you can always pick it up at a ftp site. I won't post the site
here but if you are interested, please let me know and I'll pass the
info on to you. As soon as I get my own internet node and WWW site,
I'll let you know the Url of my virtual art gallery.

:)

Hope this helps....

I think creating an inline image archive is a good idea, there are many
icon archives in the public domain and I think that a library of lines,
arrows, sound links compressed files text files etc will help

Wether this spider should be run is a contentious question, usual indexing
spiders already annoy people so maybe not.  The spider could use the
no_access  files ideas of Martijn Koster and his robots page.
http://web.nexor.co.uk/mak/doc/robots/robots.html

If CERN or NCSA etc would put a user-contributable library of small gifs
for inline images I'm sure this would be appreciated.  Many web maintainers
will already have such files so one could be created quickly and this would
allow new sites to setup quicker.

NCSA httpd is an HTTP/1.0 compatible server for hypermedia documents.
It runs on a plethora of UNIX systems. NCSA httpd is also compatible
with the Common Gateway Interface which allows interactive document
generation.

All of the documentation for NCSA httpd is online hypertext. See

* Fixed core dump related to recursive parsed document include
* Fixed bug by which httpd would not follow a symbolic link it should have
* Fixed file typing (no longer case sensitive like in 1.2)
* Parent directory escaped in indexes
* IdentityCheck should work again
* LAST_MODIFIED and #flastmod are now local zone
* Time related functions work with NeXT now
* Fixed spelling error in 500 error page
* Server will log proper timeout message for non-DNS hosts
* Added x-bit hack for people to use the x-bit of an HTML file to determine
  if it is parsed or not
* Added compile defines so people can customize the amount of DNS the server 
  performs (for speed)

Hi,

Mosaic for X has a X-resource simpleInterface which is by default false.
Now I want to use the simple interface only occasionaly (in fact
I want to start Mosaic for a manual page browser, and Mosiac will be
started via a system("Mosaic http://....") call)
Is there anyway to set such a resource variable only for the execution
of one command, and forget about it later on?

I realize this is more an X or a unix question, and if simpleInterface
would be allowed on the command line of Mosaic the solutuion would be
trivial.

You can do it from the command line:

Thanks Gertjan,

the answer was even quicker than the www-talk server (I got your

The Proxy server is a great idea, but can act as a bottle neck for
external access. Is anyone interested in the work I have done on
a lightweight shared cache based on the Gnu dbm package?

This uses a simple UDP-based protocol to map URLs to file names.
Clients then retrieve the local copy from the shared filestore
by a mechanism such as nfs. If the document isn't in the cache,
the client retrieves it directly (using Socks to get thru firewalls)
and then loads it into the shared filestore (via nfs) and registers
it with the cache server. This approach places a minimal burden
on the cache server and so caters well for large sites. I will be
demonstrating this as part of my HTML+ browser at the WWW'94 conference.

There will be a poster placed on the sign-up board on Sunday May 14
(the first day of registration) where those interested can sign-up.
Or you can send me e-mail.

The conference organizer (Joe Boykin, who is in the office next to
me) will schedule the approriate room(s) size based on the ammount
of interest. So, I need to have some idea as to how many are interested.

The final times and locations should be filled into this poster
when the final arrangements are solidified.

I am also looking for a co-chair (I just lost one).

 |Whew! I needed that!

Hear! Hear!

I support this view wholeheartedly. Indeed, this is the subject of the
<A HREF="http://tyr.let.rug.nl/~bert/SGML.html"> WWW'94 workshop</A>
that I propose to organize. We need to reach enough consensus on this
topic that we can start a coordinated development effort.

Architectural forms are nice, I even wrote an HTML meta-DTD some time
ago (on paper, and I've thrown it away), but eventually I decided that
they have too many disadvantages compared to stylesheets. Unless we
have access to so many resources that we have development capacity to
spare, I think we should focus on style sheets first.

HyTime itself is much too complex for us at the present time, maybe in
five years time it will be feasible. HyTime-like Architectural Forms
have the advantage that they are pure SGML, but the disadvantage that
they are difficult to understand and that SGML doesn't seem to be a
very convenient language for writing programs in. Stylesheets can be
written in better languages.

Although I hate Lisp, I think the Scheme-based DSSSL (currently an ISO
draft standard, I believe) is the best bet when it comes to defining
the tree-transformations that define the on-screen/on-paper
representation of an SGML element. I'm waiting for the first WWW
browser with an embedded Scheme interpreter!

<sidebar>
  Surprisingly, a stylesheet in Scheme would work in exactly the
  opposite way from previously proposed stylesheet mechanisms. Simple
  stylesheets are `document-driven': they define for each SGML element
  how it would be rendered. A formatter would read a document as a
  stream and apply a style to each element it encounters.

  A stylesheet in Scheme is very different: a formatter would read the
  style and *execute* it as a Scheme program. The document is treated
  as a database from which the Scheme program can retrieve elements,
  in any order, even more than once or not at all.

Subject: filetype extensions
Beak: Is Not
Organization: cmu
content-length: 2195

  Okay, I've run into a small dilemna.

  I wrote a www server from scratch at the same time that I began
supporting Mosaic as a contributed application at Andrew, for the
experience of writing the server, gaining a full knowledge of the
protocol, and because I was bored :-)

  Embracing the http/1.0 concept of multiple content types for the same
document, the server takes the Accept: list from the client, turns it
into a list of extensions, and attempts to access each path.extension in
turn.

  So a user can have "foo.gif", "foo.xpm", "foo.jpeg", and "foo.ppm" in
their www directory, and access it as "foo" from the server, leaving it
to the client to insert things like "Accept: image/gif", and the server
to hand back something that the client can deal with.

  The problem:  I've run into substantial resistance to the idea from
the user community.  They want to add hyperlinks to "foo.gif", not
"foo".

  I'm getting two arguments for the use of extensions in the URL's:
People want to be able to use 'file:' and relative links to view their
files without going through the server (and maybe get the server to
translate pages on the fly when requested from AFS sites into 'file:'
links, reducing HTTP server load), and they want to maintain
compatibility with the other AFS www server on campus (run by our School
of Computer Science), which handles extensions the "normal" way.

  I've also had a request to try to resolve document types only when the
client doesn't send an extension on the request; the problems here are
that the extension in the URL is still significant (which seems a bit
backwords), and that eventually I'd like to implement a mechanism to
allow the user to use the extensionless file to specify versions of
documents in different languages, character sets, and encodings.

  So... what do people think?  Pragmatism or Purism?  Should I bow down
to the pressure to stop having it try to add extensions?

  A better question: does anyone have a *good* http namespace <-> unix
filesystem namespace mapping?  Taking into account varying content
types, encodings, languages, and the various "preferred" modifiers that
can be attached to all of these?  :-)

Isn't it interesting that each time a new implementor comes along,
s/he has to trip over all the hacks, kludges, and general differences
between the specs and the existing implementations and practices...
Perhaps one day the specs will be caught up...

Good idea, but I'd suggest a slight twist: I don't think it's wise
to assume that there is a well-defined mapping:
	ext : ContentType -> String
so I wouldn't encourage the approach of working from content types
to extensions. The technique I like (found it in WWWLibrary) is to
keep a table of:
		ContentType, extension String, confidence Float

Then, start with the given path; find all (type, ext, conf) such that path.ext
exists in the filesystem, and maximize conf where type is in the
client's Accept: list. (Actually, you're supposed to take into account
cost-per-byte to transmit and translation quality in the metric function...
details are in the HTTP spec...)

So they don't get multi-format magic. Their loss. See below about symlinks...

ACK! Thou Shalt Not Promote The Use of The Unclean 'file:' Scheme!
Surely it will lead you down The Path to Confusion and Dispair!
The Holy Access Types Are, As Set Forth in RFC 1521 (MIME):
	local-file:  (obsoletes file:)
	afs:
	anon-ftp:
	ftp:
	mail-server: (obsoletes mailto:)
plus the Other Happily Well-Defined URL Schemes:
	http:
	gopher:
and the Somewhat Unstable But Forthcoming:
	wais:
	news:
and the Hoplessly Wierd But Useful:
	telnet:
	tn3270:

if you want to write an HREF that means "get file X the same way
you got this one," you can just leave the access type implicit; e.g.:

	HREF="/pub/stuff/file.txt"


> and they want to maintain
>compatibility with the other AFS www server on campus (run by our School

 Is it too much to
ask them to use HREF="foo" and make a link/symlink from foo to foo.gif
for local-file access and to support other servers?

Hmmm... yess... "the extension... is still significant." If a client
specifically wants the gif version of foo, I'd rather see it send:

	GET foo HTTP/1.0
	Accept: image/gif

than

	GET foo.gif HTTP/1.0
	Accept: */*

The latter form will probably work for now... but what about the future
when there may be caching proxy servers with built-in graphics conversion?
Such a proxy may have image/tiff, and it may be able to generate image/gif
faster than going round-trip to the original server. But extensions are
an out-of-band technique: a proxy server can't "peek" at the extensions
the way it can look at the Accept: header.

We must be very careful about time-to-live, conversion quality, etc.
to be sure that the proxy servers don't compromise the protocol.

There's some stuff in the HTTP protocol spec about a URI: and Vary:
header in the server's response to address this. Basically, a server
is supposed to tell the client how long it can cache the document,
and whether there are variations on the document.

Oh... we also need a way to express

	GET foo HTTP/1.0
	Accept: image/gif

in an HREF (or in HTML somewhere)... because sometimes you want to
refer to a specific version/format of a document. I've suggested
	<A HREF="foo" Content-Type="image/gif">...</a>
and
	<A HREF="foo;content-type=image/gif">...</a>
in the past without much luck. The second form, which puts the data
in the URL, has some chance of being deployed... stay tuned...

Enough Purism to save yourself from having to re-engineer your solution
down the road, mixed in the enough Pragamatism to make it useful to
your user community today.

Um. If you ask a proxy for foo.gif (or foo with accept image/gif) it is supposed 
to ask the original server for the expiry and last-modified date to be sure that 
the version it has is exactly, in every detail, the same as the original.

Conversion in the manner you suggest negates all this. If the proxy has bar.tif 
and converts it to bar.gif, it is not necessarily the same as the original 
servers version. What quantisation algorithm was employed - Heckbert's? Wu's? In 
what colour space? RGB? CXMYK? CIELAB (TIFF supports all of these). How many 
colours was it quantised to, and is the resolution the same?

For people who are text oriented and view images as minor decoration, these 
differences are inconsequential. But you cannot be certain that the content of 
the image is of so little worth. And plenty of people are using the web to 
distribute scientific visualisations, medical images, computer graphics for 
example where these differences are extremely important.

> We must be very careful about time-to-live, conversion quality, etc.
> to be sure that the proxy servers don't compromise the protocol.

Indeed. How are you going to specify that the quality does not matter (eg a 
silly little help icon in xpm and you want it as a gif) or does matter (a 
medical image) and how much it matters? If a proxy is supposed to guarantee you 
get the same result as going direct, then such conversions must be ruled out. 
And yet, for many purposes, the conversions would be entirely adequate. But let 
us not rule out certain applications of the web just because many current images 
are content-free.

Having recently put up some images on the web as part of a paper I gave on gamut 
mapping and so on, where the differences between images were small but vital, 
this issue is of immediate concern to me.

What an excellent aphorism! Unfortunately if these things get enshrined in 
standards, this flexible balance goes out the window and you have to specify 
exactly what happens in each case. Ho hum.

Subject: Status: -> Progress:
content-length: 805

I recently sent some browser patches that allow a server to send
status updates while working on a lengthy request (like an archie search).
I know of at least two people who are using them, but I forgot that
CGI/1.1 uses a "Status:" header already.  While the interaction between
the two is not technically a problem (since one could only expect nph-
scripts to utilize my Status: properly), I think it would be best to
avoid confusion and use "Progress:" as the header for lengthy request
status updates.

Does anyone see a problem with this?  I should hope that the changeover
of the installed base will be easy enough.

For a little background, telnet to www.cs.ubc.ca on port 80 and type

GET /test-status HTTP/1.0<CR><LF><CR><LF>

and I think you'll get the idea.  Or check out the www-talk archive.

Reply-To: jpw@virginia.edu

I apologize if this is an inappropriate place to raise this question,  
but I seem to be having problems passing a couple of shell variables in  
a CGI script.  Everything works fine for X-Windows Mosaic, but one  
variable gets dropped in queries from both lynx and MS-Windows Mosaic.   
They run something like this:

case $QS_bool in
        and)    OPT_bool="^" ;;
        or)     OPT_bool="+" ;;
        not)    OPT_bool="-" ;;
        *)      OPT_bool="^" ;;
esac

case $QS_docs in
        page)   OPT_docs="page" ;;
        stanza) OPT_docs="stanza"    ;;
        poem)   OPT_docs="poem" ;;
        *)      OPT_docs="page" ;;
esac

case $QS_size in
        1-10)           OPT_size='subset' ;;
        11-20)          OPT_size='subset.11' ;;
        21-30)          OPT_size='subset.21' ;;
        31-40)          OPT_size='subset.31' ;;
(last one shortened for this example)
esac

The OPT_docs values are gone when searches are sent to the server.  (I  
capture the results of the query in an intermediate file, so have a good  
idea what's being received.)  Does this owe to my ignorance in shell  
programming, or deficiencies in FORMS recognition by some clients?

Subject: beyond IMAGEMAP 
content-length: 868

We use NCSA httpd and Mosaic to present a GIF image as a clickable map to
the client.  The IMAGEMAP (ISMAP) facility allows the pixel coordinates of the
mouseclick to be interpreted.  Some document is served or some parameter is
passed to a server script depending on the location of the mouse click in
the image.

This facility is extremely powerful and allows very creative ways to serve
information.  However we are finding that for many applications we need more
than a simple point location on the image. We need the user to be able to
define a rectangle on the map image (click, hold, drag, release).

As I understand it, this operation is not currently supported by IMAGEMAP.
Are there any plans to introduce this feature or can can anyone see other
ways around this lack?

This might be considered a hack, but it's likely to work fine:  have the
user click once on the image map, then return exactly the same page with
the clicked coordinate highlighted somehow on the image map itself, and
the user clicks again, and you can form a rectangle from those two 
sets of coordinates.

I have just realised what it is with this that bothers me :)

==== O/P from above example: ====

HTTP/1.0 200 Document Follows

....

==== O/P from above example: ====

In the case of what we are doing here, it would be nice to send back
these Status/Progress reports _BUT_ the search isnt sure of the correct
HTTP response code when it starts. The response code depends on the
results of the search. (eg: 200 is OK,  302 is a referal for correct
retrival later on, 40x is a failure etc.)

I cant quite see how this method would allow you to be alter the
response on the fly. The only way that I can see this scheme working
correctly would be to define a new status code that can be superceeded
in the header, like say:

But I can also see problems with this. :) So I cant see it being a
possibility for a lot of heavy DB usage, where you cant expect to know 
you have a hit immediatly.

Actually looking at my copy of the HTTP spec I cant see anything that
says you cant alter the status code on the fly but I have a feeling that
it would break most if not all browsers :) :) :)

Anyone for HTTP/1.1 ? :)

A way around this is to have a "message/http-response" (or whatever)
Content-Type that identifies the body as a HTTP/1.0 response.  With
that available, you can do stuff like:

HTTP/1.0 200 Document Follows
MIME-Version: 1.0
Status: Half-way there, sport
Status: All done
Content-Type: message/http-response

HTTP/1.0 302 Found
Location: http://...../
MIME-Version: 1.0

This can be compatible with old browsers since the new ones will
indicate compatibility with "Accept: message/http-response".  I recon
libWWW can be hacked to handle the new type fairly easily -- just
a matter of massaging the HTTP handling code into a stream module.
I think "message/http-reponse" would be quite a useful addition
for the people writing HTTP <-> mail gateways, proxys and caching
servers.

I'd say this is a reasonable way to extend the simple status reporting.
Does "message/http-response" exist?  If not, is "message/http-response"
the right name?

	While we're on this thread,  it would be useful if the 
method that the server employed to receive those parameters NOT imply 
an overloading of the UNIX file path.   I'm thinking: 
 
		/xxxbin/imagemap,/~user/usersmap?x,y 
 
	where /xxxbin/imagemap gets (fully resolved) ~user/usersmap 
as a parameter or environment variable and then also gets x and y. 
Does this make sense?   Not sure if I've expressed the idea well. 
 
	The CMS HTTPD (the piped one, not CERN's) will parse comma-
separated values before the '?' and pass them as parms to the script. 
Then anything after the '?' (search args, form responses, whatever) 
are fed as  input to  the script  (wether GET or PUT, the script 
works the same way).   I know that at least one other server uses 
something like this (semicolon in that case).   Thoughts?

Which would be the "best" for installation of a WWW server (and clients)?

I observed this problem a few months back, and my suggestion was to
put more muscle into clients, sending them the map configuration file
so that they could highlight hotspots and give better feedback
(dragging would be nice too; I hadn't thought of that one...)

Anyway, one of my co-workers brought back a piece of software from
GopherCon called Blue Skies, which has some nice features.  It follows
this model of leaving the handling of map clicks up to the client
instead of the server.  It uses weather maps for its demonstrations.  

Currently, the only available client is for macintosh.  Get it at:
ftp://madlab.sprl.umich.edu/pub/Blue-Skies/Blue-Skies_1.0.sea.hqx

It would be nice to see this type of functionality make it over to the
web...  (look out, those gopher people are catching up!!!! :-)

	Joe

You can (or soon will be able to) use multiple submit buttons,
The server uses the NAME attribute to distinguish between them.

Very good point. Now... can we go back in time and pretend that I had said:

	"Assume, for the sake of argument, that this caching server implements
	100% intvertible translation between gif and tiff."

Another good poing. It appears that clients should be able to express
a tolerance (and lack thereof) for information loss in conversion.

Something like:

	Accept: image/gif; t=1.0

The Accept: header already specifies things like how much it costs the client
to deal with the given format, and tolerance on how long it is willing to wait
for a conversion. We just add one that says "my tolerance for information loss
is 1.0, i.e. no information loss is tolerable." For help icons and such, you
would set t=0.9 or so.

To reiterate: we need to be able to put this info _in_the_link_markup_, since
it is not only a function of the client's capabilities, but also of the author's
intent. For example, when I create a link to a help icon, I don't care if a few
color bits here and there get changed. But if I'm linking to a medical image,
I certainly do care!

I agree with your evidence, but not with your conclusion that _all_
"such conversions must be ruled out." We just need to be careful! Keep
all the issues on the table and allow references to express _exactly_
what they refer to, and how much "slop" they'll tolerate.

I am willing to pretend that you said

	"Assume, for the sake of argument, that this caching server implements
	100% intvertible translation between format A and format B."

The particular example you cited (tiff to gif) had enough problems; the reverse 
process is guaranteed not to produce the same image. The information loss going 
from a 24 bit TIFF to an 8 bit (at best) GIF is no way reversible.

> It appears that clients should be able to express
> a tolerance (and lack thereof) for information loss in conversion.

Yes, and this then harks back to the earlier discussion about format conversion 
and negotiation on the original server.

> Something like:

It does? You mean, in theory, or do actual clients and servers generate and use 
this information?

> We just add one that says "my tolerance for information loss
> is 1.0, i.e. no information loss is tolerable." For help icons and such, you

OK, but you need to specify what exactly the different levels of quality mean. 
1.0 is clear enough ;-) and so is 0.0 - convert it any old way but give me some 
sort of image.

The meaning of the intermediate values needs to be defined. How does 0.7 diffier 
from 0.4, exactly?

A further point; I assumed 1.0 to mean the exact same file as on the server. 
What if, however, you ask the original server for

Accept: image/x-iris-rgb; t=1.0

(Iris RGB is a lossless 24 bit image format BTW) and the server has TIFF 
available? It can do a conversion, and it can guarantee (in most cases) that the 
RGB value of each pixel is identical. But it is not the same file.

And another thing - suppose a server is configured to convert the TIFF to an 
Iris RGB, maybe cache it for a day, then delete it to prevent wasting disk space 
as multiple formats of the same image build up. A month later, I use the same 
URL and get the same conversion done. Fine. Now put a proxy in the way; it 
happens to be cacheing last months Iris RGB file. If I ask it for that file, and 
it asks the original server for the last modified and expires fields for 
foo.rgb.

What should the server respond? The values for the original TIFF?  A 
last-modified of NOW as it is building the file transparently, on the fly, as we 
speak?

Or consider the case where the server does not throw away the conversions, but 
keeps them around (disk space is cheap at this theoretical site). Now I alter 
the original TIFF. Whose responsibility is it to expire the Iris RGB, JPEG, Utah 
RLE, PCX, etc etc formats that (perhaps unbeknownst to me) the server has 
created. And later I make an even newer version of the image, but choose to save 
it as a UTAH RLE. What happens to the previous TIFF (just in case you were 
thinking of designating one formnat as a master format on which the others 
depend, like some sort of revision control system or makefile)

[ Note for those who care; Iris RGB and Utah RLE (assumed linear encoding) and 
TIFF (assumed generic RGB coding) are all 24 bit lossless formats. Within the 
assumptions specified, these 3 can be freely and repeatedly interconverted 
without information loss, which is why I picked them as examples.]

To sum up, I am saying that there is a complex interaction between a) 
transparent format negotiation and conversion, and b) cache coherency issues 
arising from proxy cacheing. These raise a whole host of issues that urgently 
need an interim solution and long term need to be elegantly sorted out and 
documented. 

The issues do not seem to have been raised before till I started messing with 
them, but then I don't work in a computer graphics unit for nothing ;-)

I think that part of the problem comes from the general culture of early 
internet users. If images are just little gifs of hands, arrows etc that mean 
'back', or they are JPEGs of trains, landscapes and naked ladies to stick in 
your root window, the image quality considerations go out the window. But the 
internet in general and WWW in particular will not remain the preserve of the 
'casual browser at a university' for long.

Once you start getting important or even 'mission critical' images floating 
around, these issues need to be solved. That time has not yet arrived - but that 
time might be next year; lets sort it out while there is time.

By important I mean publishers shipping 48 MByte TIFFs which will eventually be 
brought into a page layout system and appear in a glossy magazine. They don't 
want the image content of these to be converted or altered. They may however be 
happy if the internal (lossless) compression goes from packbits to lzw, as there 
is no information loss. They certainly don't want it converted on the fly from a 
40 K GIF that happens to have the same name.

By mission critical I mean things like medical images; if I have just been put 
in a cat scanner and a consultant somewhere on the other side of the world is 
teleconferencing with the surgeon who is about to perform brain surgery on me, I 
want that consultant to see *exactly* the original image !!

<Side_issue>
This cultural heritage also shows in the mime types. image/tiff conveys nothing, 
really. Look at the TIFF 6.0 spec. How do I specify that I can handle packbits 
and lzw encoding, but not JPEG encoding; that I can handle palette and full 
colour generic RGB, CMYK, greyscale, and bilevel images but not YCbCr, or CIELAB 
and I would like any tiled images to be converted to strips? These are all 
"tiff"

Of course, TIFF is the most complex format being discussed here.
</Side_issue>

I agree absolutely. The tolerance info will vary from image to image so it 
cannot be set once-for-all when installing the browser, for example. The 
information must be saved in the document as it cannot in general be inferred.

> For example, when I create a link to a help icon, I don't care if a few

This agrees with my position.

Ok, fine. Once the definitions have been firmed up, tested out and standardised, 
this seems to me the way to go.

<Side_issue>
One side effect of this is that document creation becomes, again, more complex. 
A consequence of greater penetration of the web is that the range of skills in 
both providers and consumers of information increases. You get more gurus, and 
more dummies, as well as more folk in the middle.

As a consequence, productivity tools and intelligent, quasi-wysiwyg editors are 
becoming more and more essential.  The markup is becoming more and more complex. 
People need to be sheilded from it. 

I can see an editor where the writer has just inserted a link to an external RLE 
image. Up pops a dialog box with directories and files, so th efilename gets 
spelled right. Up pops another with some fields for "link text" and "brief 
description" (for the ALT tag) and some checkboxes for image importance: just 
decoration, keep similar, keep exact (for example). It then goes and puts four 
lines of HTML++ gobbledegook into the file to express all this. And talks to the 
revision control system to notify it about the new image file. And so on. People 
are just not going to do all this by hand.
</Side-issue>

Comments from anyone about any part of this are solicited.

My recommendation would be to advocate the implementation of the  
"scribble" widget as defined by the HTML+ FORMs spec.  The "scribble"  
widget allows completely arbitrary mouse input to be accumulated, and  
then sent to the server when the FORM is submitted.  As part of a  
FORM, this input can be easily coordinated with other information.

I'm eagerly looking forward to this capability, since it will enable  
more sophisticated interactive geometry applications.  For example,  
our new Kali app (http://www.geom.umn.edu/apps/kali/about.html) could  
really benefit from such an input mechanism.

There's code in WWWLibrary2.15 to support this. I infer from that evidence

Let's see... the way I see it, only 0.0 and 1.0 have "universal"
meaning -- the other numbers can only be compared with other numbers
in the same request. For example, you might write:

	Accept: image/gif; t=.9, image/jpeg; t=.8

to mean "If you've got lossy conversion to JPEG or to GIF, I'll take
JPEG, cuz I suspect that a lossy conversion to GIF involved dithering
or something rediculous like that, but JPEG compression is usually
pretty invisible to the eye."

Hmm.. the server perhaps shoul multipy .9 by some estimated data los
in the ->JPEG conversion, and .8 times the ->GIF conversion factor,
and compare the products. Anyway... the .8 and .9 shouldn't be used
outside this context.

>A further point; I assumed 1.0 to mean the exact same file as on the server. 

Nope. (Of course I'm making this up as I go, but...) If you want the
same file, you gotta know the format it's stored in and ask for
that. Or ask for it by MD-5 signature, or something like that.

For the original TIFF... and yes, this gets hairy. But we want it done

You're darn right it conveys nothing -- that's why it's not a standard

	Right!   Both an "internal" (server) weight and an "external"

In putting together my "Composing Good HTML" document, one suggestion 
that was made to me was to include a discussion on relative URLs.  I 
tried doing this, but realized that I had a major problem -- namely, that 
I couldn't find any canonical reference on what is safe and what is 
unsafe.  Does such a reference exist?  What relative URLs are guaranteed 
to work (i.e., within the same directory, subdirectories, on the same 
server), and what kinds of URLs will actually trip up the browser?  I've 
run into cases where different browsers will interpret relative URLs 
differently, for instance.

Perhaps there's a canonical test set? (heh.)

Cheers,

Hello,

for my PhD I would like to perform a statistical evaluation of hotlist 
entries for WWW. It would be nice, if anybody takes the time to mail me

My aim is to evaluate the average number of references to WWW documents
and to get an overview about what people are interested in.

Any help would be very much appreciated.

Thanks for your time and effort,

The HTML+ internet draft suggested extending ISMAP to support drags as
well as clicks. This is a simple extension, but as yet no one as far as
I know supports it.

The other solution is to use scribble on image fields in fill-out forms.
This allows users to scribble with a pointing device over an image, and
is part of proposed extensions to current fill-out form capabilities.
It involves switching to a MIME based encoding of form contents and I
hope to clarify this at the WWW'94 conference with browser writers.

It would be useful to start a list of features for a next major

    o   Additional Logging info
    o   Multi-GETs

The HTML+ <FIG> element handles the mouse clicks in the client
and unifies the treatment of graphical and non-graphical systems.
It also means authors can create graphical menus etc without
needing to do anything on the server side - this reduces the burden
on Webmasters. I hope to demo this at the WWW'94 conference.

202 Accepted would be a better choice for a response code -- it implies
that the content may (or may not) be what was requested, but that the
server is working on the request.

 Hi dave,

      o   dynamic pages

well that's too short perhaps, so let me tell you a bit more.
What I would *love* to have is some html tag to tell the browser that
the next elements are dynamic and can change contents on request of the server
so something like: 
<dynamic name="somelabel">this text can change</dynamic>
or the current rate for the dutch guilder is <dynamic name=rate>$0.49</dynamic>

anything should be allowed between <dynamic> and </dynamic>, even other
html tags such as images.

How could this communicate?
the easiest thing to do, is not to close the connection for dynamic pages,
but let the server send something like:
<head>...</head><body>....</body>  (at this point the client should
display the current page) followed by (at much later times, say when the
dollar rate changes)<update name=rate>$0.51</update>
at that point the client will update the page.
As soon as the client start viewing othe pages, the connection drops. (or
when the server thinks that a client has seen enough)

this sheme would work, but would easely overload the server with too many
open connections.

Much easier perhaps (and not as powerfull) is to have the client to
actively request the update, in which case the client must know when to do
so. How can it know? in general it cannot know, but changing the syntax
to :
<dynamic time=200 src="URL...">$0.49</dynamic> could tell the client
to actively request an update after 200 seconds. 
and replace whatever is in between <dynamic></dynamic> with what it gets
from the url in the src=URL.

other ways are possible, but probably not easy to implement on browsers
without UNIX (one could think of the client to partially implement a
aerver, so the real server could simply close the initial connection and as
soon as the dollar rate changes send a request to the client)

All in all I think <dynamic time =200 src=URL> is feasable *NOW* and much
more powerfull then one might think at first sigth.
/* dynamic loading of images, status information from a long database
 search, having an inlined image and change it to an inlined mpeg (I know
 we don't have inlined mpegs yet in most browsers */
The time=200 should be treated as an repeat value, so the client will
request the dynamic part every 200 seconds, but that time should change
whenever the result from a dynamic load contains a mime header with a
valid expires. That 'expires' could be well into the next century so
the client will stop requesting dynamic loads from the server)

In fact I would have implemented this myself for mosaic, but the NCSA people
are not the most willing-to-change people. (I have had some unpleasant
experiences with my postscript module. In fact I have a request to support
A4 paper, and still haven't heard from them at all)

Does this really require a REFRESH attribute? It seems that everything
except the delayed loading would still work if the client only used
the Expires header of the included document. I can see that delayed
loading is nice, but in practice I think it would nearly always be
refresh=0, because it is to much work to keep the expire rate of the
external doc and the refresh attribute in step and to keep the
contents of the INCLUDE element coordinated with the contents of the
external doc.

Let me pitch an idea that would mean something to a new HTTP.  
I won't spleen ad nauseum, as I would rather get a prototype 
working before blue-skying. Unfortunately, I don't know tcl-dp,
perl5, or python, or why I should be choosing them!  Anyway...

Imagine a new httpd that doesn't write to a "filesystem", rather
was written in the OO versions of tcl, perl(5?), or python.  
Attributes such as logging information, discretionary access, meta
information such as indices and document owner would be object
attributes in a "document class".  The HTML itself could be
decomposed into a more granular object, with child objects for
each entity.  This granularity would allow more attributes such
as versioning for group editing and workflow "intelligence".

Thus, could HTTP be extened to send any arbitrary "message" to
the "document" object?  This perl5 or tcl-dp httpd would 
recompose the document to send to the client, thus allowing
conformance with the stream it should be sending, but the ability
to notify the client what public methods the document supports,
and allowing the client to send messages altering the state of
the document object, would be, well, good :^)

	This is already almost possible without a complete rewrite. 
This is why I suggested a "parameters" syntax 
 
		GET /path/path/path/object,parms?args [HTTP/1.0] 
 
	(whether that delimiter is a semi-colon or a comma,  
I don't care;  maybe it could even be an ampersand)   The "args" 
are dynamic,  while the "parms" are more (but not totally) static. 
The reason I mention it in this context is that it's specifically 
intended for *program* objects,  not ordinary files.

	This is really good stuff,  Paul.   But again,  I don't think 
we have to completely reinvent HTTPD to accomplish it.   I think we're 
almost there with some of the latest juicy CGI ideas.   Any "object" 
that's a program instead of a file can accomplish what you're after. 
Just be vewy vewy kay-uh-ful about the security implications.

Subject: Slippery Slope (was Status: -> Progress:)
content-length: 1783

It seems to me that many of the proposed HTTP enhancements are walking a
slippery slope from today's connection-free model towards a connection-based
model.  Once you keep the connection between the server and the client active
for a long time (e.g. long enough for 'Progress' messages to be appropriate,
or long enough for dynamic updating of content to be useful), you might as
well provide full two-way communication back and forth between the client and
the server.

This two-way channel would allow higher interactivity.  Info providers could
design pages with a mix of the newly available push model (the server updates
the screen to indicate fast-breaking news, availability of new information, or
the arrival of a new response) and today's pull model (the user clicks on a
"What's New" button, the client updates the screen whenever the user is idle).

The main drawbacks that I see are that everything is more heavyweight.
  1) tying up network resources (To borrow someone's Web ftp analogy, we would
     be buying everyone an 18-wheeler, replacing all those pesky little
     motorcycles that are darting in and out of traffic.)
     
  2) complexity (Having state means dealing with state.  If the connection
     goes down, we need mechanisms to recover somewhat smoothly.  If a session
     lasts for a while, predicting and debugging correct behavior gets
     trickier.)

Having pushed further down (up?) the slippery slope, I find myself with
mixed feelings.  I'd love the functionality provided by connections, but I'm
concerned about killing the beautiful simplicity of "GET URL" returning an
HTML document.  As usual, some halfway and/or mixed solution is probably the
best choice.

What do people think?

<Soapbox>
HTTP/1.0 is a connection-free model and I think it should stay that way; it
works, don't break it. HTTP/2.0 or whatever we end up calling it, can
support connections, encryption of headers, negotiation of Accepts,
multiple GETs, etc., but I don't think we should *break* what we have today
with HTTP/1.0. In fact, what is needed most is to get the HTTP/1.0
specification out of Internet-Draft status and make it an RFC so we all
have two feet to stand on rather than the "well, that's what X Mosaic
does." argument we so often hear. I do not want to deviate completely from
our de facto standards today, rather I want some standards to point to in
the form of an RFC, informational or otherwise. To accomplish this I think
we have to move some of the features described in the current online HTTP
specification to the HTTP/2.0 specification. Then we need to clear up
(edit) some of the language in the current specification to remove
ambiguities. This should not take a long time, in fact, by the July IETF or
the Fall IETF at the latest the specification should be set in stone and
everybody will be coding to the same thing.

This argument applies to HTML as well, with the difference that I think
FORMs as currently implemented should be added to what I would call HTML
1.0. SGML compliance may or may not be possible with HTML as it is today,
you would certainly have to be lenient in many cases. Alos, it is important
to not delay the HTML RFC to include HTML+, which should be a separate RFC.

I am completely willing to back off from adding new features and toss out
unimplemented features in order to get these RFCs done. However, I will not
support an ongoing munge of what we have today as has happened with the URL
fiasco. I've talked to a number of people offline that agree that getting
HTTP/1.0 and HTML 1.0 to RFC status is a good idea and more importantly,
doable within a short timeframe. There are even people interested in
spending time to make it happen rather than just talk about it :)

Finally, I would like to suggest that if the Web is at all about
interoperability and ubiquity then the architectural foundation has to be
finished and soon or there will be many small Web communities that can't
communicate with the other ones. This is not a threat, this is a reality
coming our way. So far we've been lucky, but I've seen some of the ways
organizations and companies intend to exploit portions of the Web and if
you want to continue to get to most if not all of the content published
then we have to give publishers (this includes individuals as well)
something real to base their publishing on, not a moving target or a single
de facto implementation that changes every month.

I'm currently working in perl5 to write Plexus 4.0 which will basically
do what you describe by overlaying an "object database" (of some form)
with the standard filesystem in some, hopefully, interesting ways.

Clearly, the current server design (of at least CERN, NCSA, and Plexus)
isn't going to be able to cleanly support all of the HTTP features we want
to be able to support.

I'm thinking about something like this (where [stuff] means it's optional):
     GET object[{msg}][;metadata][?querydata]
Where ``msg'' is defined by the object (and to some extent the server,
perhaps added by some standard, see next paragraph) but is probably some
form of attribute/value pair.  And "metadata" is resevered for
future standardization in the HTTP URL space (since there has been
some talk about this in the past though the exact syntax may differ
from my example).

Perhaps we need to form a group to define a Common HyperObject Protocol
so servers can agree on these conventions, like CGI does for the current
interface but perhaps a little more comprehensive.

Not everything *needs* the refresh attribute, delayed loading can be
done much nicer otherways, but the delayed loading example was just
an example to demonstrate the power of a refresh attribute.

re-using the expire time in the header to reset the refresh rate was
also just an idea, which seems logical, but a better approach is perhaps
to replace the text from the <include> up to the </include> include those
two tags. If the included text happens to have a <include refresh = 200>
than that part will refresh after 200 seconds. That seems even cleaner
to me, because no magic is involved, and the included part can be stored
on some caching scheme, because the expire date is really the expire date
and we don't need to overload things.

yet another example of the power of include & refresh is to make
a nice slide show. Just start every page of the show with
<include refresh=15 src="url_of_next_slide"> and end the page with </include>
each page will show for 15 seconds and automaticlly load the next slide.

or
refresh an image taken by a life camera every 2 minutes
or
... use your imagination.

as said before having the client handle this seems feasable with current
technology in the web. The only problem is that browser will need to
reformat the document every time an update occurs

using the above  proposal doesn't need the Expires header and the header
still can have Expires in the original meaning (good for caching servers or
caching gateways) The document itself does not expire but the static 
document contains a dynamic element . No need to keep th expire header
in sync with the include element.

I'm about to do some server/os/platform benchmarking, and the following
issues come to mind:

1.  What makes a "typical" URL mix?  One thing I would like to do is ask
webmasters running busy servers to send me copies of say a Monday's log
file (feel free to remove client names/addresses if you like), especially
if you feel your server can't handle the load it's getting.

2.  Initial indications are that process startup time is the dominant
factor.  This suggests that a benchmark consisting of lots of little
documents will be most telling; I expect that big documents will be
bandwidth limited and not dependent on server performance (unless it's
got a direct T3 interface).

3.  How should scripts be handled?  Obviously, a script can be arbitrarily
complex, but are there some common things that should be analyzed (for
example a WAIS search, but then that may be more appropriately handled
in an entirely separate analysis)?  I'm inclined to ignore them for now.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome, and I do plan to make the test
suite available when finished, as well as a result summary.  Thanks!

I started hacking some instrumentation into NCSA's httpd to see where it 
was spending time (I couldn't find a profiling tool that would work through 
the fork(), though in retrospect it probably would have been easier to run 
the server in single connection mode and throw out all of the startup 
stuff).  NOT counting the fork() time, I found the server spending about 
20-30% of its time (wall and CPU) in the code that reads the request 
headers.  Code like this doesn't help (getline() in util.c):

            if((ret = read(f,&s[i],1)) <= 0) {

Your mileage may vary.

I too am interested in performance, and am interested in whatever you come 
up with.  I'm also interested in stories from sites that are suffering 
scalability problems, if there are any to share.

A system that "does it all for you" sounds a lot like "a car that
drives itself"... :)

ObThread: We are using NCSA's httpd 1.3 on a 486/50 running BSDI 1.1,
and it has performed AMAZINGLY well.  (~20,000 hits/day)

Whilst looking through the httpd code, I noticed this too.  I meant to
send off a "bug" report to Rob, but never got around to it.  This is
pretty expensive way to go about things.  Sure, a big Sparc II can
crank through read calls at 100,000 per second, but at around 1000
characters per HTTP/1.0 header it adds up.

This is done because it wants to hand off the file descriptor to
CGI scripts that handle POSTs.  I'd suggest the right way to fix
things is to read a bufferful and cat the extra to the scripts that
need it.  However, a quick hack could double the speed by doing
read(f, &s[i], 2) because you know that at least CR LF will terminate
the line.  If it's the header boundary that's a problem, you could
quadruple the speed with read(f, &s[i], 4) since you have at least
"GET " for HTTP/0.9 requests and HTTP/1.0 headers will terminate
with CR LF CR LF (well, they better!).

I feel compelled to explain one of the worst implementation decisions I've
ever made. Yes, that's why it was done. Why? At the time I was implementing
it, Marc was testing my code by sending me forms literally megabytes long.
At roughly the same time, Mosaic/X started sending full Accept: headers that
often totalled over 1000 bytes. I wasn't aware the headers were so long (I
thought that they were MUCH shorter) and processing forms that were
megabytes long would be very common, then this would be a big win.

As it turns out, the headers for Mosaic/X are over 1000 bytes long, forms
are almost always well under 1000 bytes themselves, and my implementation
loses big time and is not scalable. This is something I was meaning to fix
in 2.0, but for the NCSA version someone else will be taking up the reins.

YES! I have started the conversion bit by bit to make the CERN WWWlib  
multi-threaded on the client side. Though, I am making it in parallel with a  
lot of other things, but my plan is to get it ready for a release 2.16.

Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!

Excellent! Please make it reentrant as well (I had to hack the old lib a 
little bit to make it that).

Subject: Forced cache refresh and no_proxy in Mosaic
Cc: mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu
content-length: 7240


Dear WWW proxy (cern_httpd) users,

As release notes of CERN httpd 3.0preX let understand, httpd as a
proxy understands the

	Pragma: no-cache

header, causing a forced cache refresh. This header line has been
added to the HTTP spec.  Clients should start supporting this, but
since nobody has time to do that, enclosed you will find 3 patch
files for Mosaic 2.4 which cause it to send this pragma when you
press Reload.

Another addition is the support of no_proxy environment variable.
For example, now I can set for my patched Mosaic:

	setenv no_proxy cern.ch

and no request to domain cern.ch goes thru the proxy but rather
directly to the server inside CERN.

Local requests going through the proxy have been an annoying side
effect of WWW proxy usage, but this no longer has to be so.

Precompiled stripped gzipped Mosaic 2.4 for SunOS 4.1.3 with and
without -lresolv is also available from directory:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/proxy-support/Mosaic-2.4

Patched versions of HTAccess.c, HTTP.c and gui-documents.c, and
patches themselves are also in that directory.

I guarantee no further support whatsoever for this, you should rather
pressure NCSA to put the patches in, these are *important* changes and
should be supported by the official version!

Cheers,

I generally read this list by looking at the HyperMail archives
at http://gummo.stnadford.edu/hypermail/www-talk...

For the last two days, any attempt to access a file results
in a 404 Not Found message. 

I could not determine who is in charge of the archive.

It seems to effect on the more recent messages. The older
ones on the list still work.

One thing I forgot to suggest:  when measuring performance, don't forget to 
take into account any access control done by your server.  If your server 
reads extra files (like NCSA's ".htaccess" file), then things will be 
slower for files in directories with access control.

If you want to be formal, you could define different classes of benchmarks
for different access control methods:

    - no access control
    - host-based access control
    - basic user/password
    - etc, etc

Subject: ANN: Best of the Web '94 open for Voting!
content-length: 1425

Well, here we go!  The Best of the Web '94 is now open for your vote!  Again, the
main URL is:
http://wings.buffalo.edu/contest/
the voting page is:
http://wings.buffalo.edu/contest/vote/

So please stop sending nominations and suggestions (typo corrections are more than
welcome).

In deference for all those of you who have "lesser" browsers :-), the voting does
not require forms (I use the server log to register votes).  Please be careful as
you select the vote registration links--I'd rather not have someone win just because
of a bunch of stray mouse clicks.

The voting will go from today until 5:00pm EST May 24.  I can't go any later, because
I wouldn't be able to get them done in time for the Conference.

One passionate plea...please take time to peruse the sites, and be thoughtful as you 
vote.  Don't automatically vote for the ones you've seen before; the purpose of this
whole thing is to make us aware of some of the unheralded work going on out there.  If
you look at everything, and the popular stuff is the best, feel free to vote for it.

Last thing:  the Browsers page is not open for voting yet, as I am still a bit short
on information.  I would appreciate feature lists and screenshots (preferably from the
developers themselves) of the following:
- tkWWW
- ViolaWWW
- the original Next Browser
- OmniWeb for Next

Thanks for your participation, and have fun!

I am looking for a program to retrieve Web documnents without having to
use a browser like Mosaic.  Ideally, I would like to type in the
URL(s), and the program would go out and get the html document(s) for
me.  Can anyone recommend a currently available tool for this? 
Ideally, it should run, or be easily adaptable to run, on a Mac, but I
have dos and Unix machines available as well.  Source code is a big
plus.  Thanks in advance.

A lot of people might think this is a joke, but the CERN Line Mode Browser is  
still alive, all though it is not kicking as much as it could be ;-). Try  
version  2.13, that you can get on (as source) 


	ftp://info.cern.ch:pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_2.13.tar.Z

This is running together with CERN WWWlib 2.15 (same site). It is very easy  
and fast in non-interactive mode and should run on anything that possibly can  
be called a computer. At the same time it has some nice features like  
LaTex-conversion etc. See 


	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/QuickGuide.html

for more information

cheers

	By multi-threaded, I take it you mean having multiple documents
you can pull up and take them in the direction that you want independent
of the other loaded documents.
	If this is the case, then by all means take a look at DosLynx,
which uses a MDI (multiple document interface) to handle this type of
multi-threading.  It does this with CERN WWWlib 2.14 with no special
modifications to the library.
	All considerations regarding multi-threading are handled by the
client by making the functions in GridText.c take special care on where
their screen output is sent specific to the HText object currently being
rendered.

God save us! Nooooo!

About 600 message/day go through comp.infosystems.www, and most of
them are browser support calls -- "I can't get Cello to work on my PC..."

There is an RFD going on about splitting comp.infosystems.www -- see
news.groups, I guess. I haven't followed it. Until then, I will not
tolerate a news->mail gateway. (I don't administer this thing, but I
can make some noise...)

I guess I wouldn't mind a mail->news gateway...

Oooo, didn't mean to start a religious debate. 8^)

   About 600 message/day go through comp.infosystems.www, and most of
   them are browser support calls -- "I can't get Cello to work on my PC..."

Not quite 600, but it's clearly more than 50.

   There is an RFD going on about splitting comp.infosystems.www -- see
   news.groups, I guess. I haven't followed it. Until then, I will not
   tolerate a news->mail gateway. (I don't administer this thing, but I

Ahh, now we're getting somewhere.

   I guess I wouldn't mind a mail->news gateway...

There should certainly be a mail->news gateway, but I believe the should be
a news->mail gateway as well, but it need not be www-talk.  Here's my reasoning:

People have preferences on how they want to get to their information.  Some
people like to browse (netnews), some like to be notified (mail), some like
to search and retrieve (WAIS).  I ask information providers to offer their
information in as many ways as possible, and let the users decide how to
get at it.

I have no problem with keeping www-talk as it is, but I'd sure like to have
a mail gateway to comp.infosystems.www, as I can't deal with netnews at all
these days.

If you're willing to write your application in Python, the module
"urllib" would do what you want.  Using it, you can do things like

	>>> f = urllib.urlopen('http://www.cwi.nl/')
	>>> while 1:
	...    line = f.readline()
	...    if not line: break	# EOF
	...    print line,
	...
	(contents of requested url appears here)

I saw several commercial web browsers demoed or discussed at Interop,
also. Some of the vendors have information about their products on the
net. Is anyone maintaining a list? I'm especially interested in those
products that are bundled with Internet access accounts (e.g.,
NetRunner).

You're better off assuming that every conversion loses a little, i.e.,
only the original most contentful is served with "loss 1.0".

Well, often authors include other information in TIFF tags that will
be lost when you convert to Iris RGB. For most purposes, you don't
care about those tags, but in a few cases you will.


Furthermore, there are different *kinds* of loss when you convert
things from one format to another, and different uses will care more
about one kind of loss than another.

For example, if you are going to print out a document or view it on a
screen, a high-resolution bitmap rendering of it might be
satisfactory; however, if you're going to merge some of the text into
another document, a SGML rendering of it might be less `lossy' for
your purposes. (even though all of the font information is lost).

Suddenly you might find that `loss' is a vector and not a single
number. (presentation fidelity, structure retention, invertible
conversion, etc.)

Specifically, I'm looking forward to the WWW library being able to handle
multiple independent time/cpu-sliced HTTP operations. This way, a browser
doesn't have to halt all user interactions (save the HTTP interupt) until
after all HTTP operation is completed or interrupted. 

With threading, for example, you would be able to read/scroll/following-links
in a page-screen, while another screen is busy doing HTTP "in the background".

Also, with multi-threaded HTTP, the <INCLUDE REFRESH=...> idea would be
more practical. Although I've implemented that dynamic feature in ViolaWWW,
at this point it's not terribly practical if the refresh rate is short,
because the UI will stop while the refresh is happening.

Don't forget, this may also require a multi-threaded  Xt and Motif library
to get everything right.  Yes R6 has the beginnings of threaded-ness but
I don't think Xm does.

	For something totally unrelated,  I wrote my own getline(). 
Trying to adhere to the  "be liberal about what you accept and 
conservative about what you generate"  rule,  it doesn't care 
whether or not there's actually a CR,  just the LF,  and returns the 
length of the string LESS the line terminator(s),  or < 0 on error. 
 
	I think mine is at least as bad as Rob's above. 
The intent was to replace it (someday) and not have a if/while 
based on characters embedded in the server proper.

	Argh!   This is bad.   Not picking on you,  George, 
but you've presumed on something that a *lot* of people seem to 
presume on.   It should be 
 
		CR LF [any amount of white space] CR LF 
 
	There are contemporary systems that CAN NOT generate a 
completely empty line in places.   This is a problem for certain 
mail user agents which don't see the header termination because 
the blank line isn't an "empty line" (cr/lf/cr/lf).   Let the blank 
line be just blank to the eyes,  not necessarily  "empty". 
 
	Try this: 
 
	    o   a line of text is NUL terminated 
		(assuming you're coding C on UNIX) [YMMV] 
	    o   when sending "on the wire" append CR & LF 
	    o   when receiving, accept either NL (LF) 
		or CR LF for end-of-line 
	    o   when processing, ignore trailing white space 
 
	Thoughts?

What you need is WWWlib (not libwww) :-

http://alephinfo.cern.ch/AL2F01$DKA100/hallam/INFOGEN/WWW/REF/url_semantic.html

WWWlib is synthesized from the spec to ensure correctness. It is intended that
it will satisfy the requirements for class II compliance with the RFC specs
soon and eventually provide class I compliance

No idea if or when this will be released.

Sure - which is why I was careful to specify generic rgb. If you have stuff like 
scanner whitepoint, phosphor chromaticities, transfer functions etc in there 
then clearly that information will be lost. I was just trying not to make it too 
complicated...

I agree with this assesment. Asking people to code this vector into every image 
URL is clearly asking tooo much unless intelligent editors are ubiquitous - 
which we cannot assume - or unless there are well chosen and documented defaults 
for when the user does not specify this vector.

If the common case is GETs (which I suspect it is for most servers), doing 
buffered reads and just copying the bytes down to the POST script is 
probably the right thing do to.  Plus, POST data _tends_ to be short 
anyway.

Actually, you can get the best of both methods.  Read the first 4 bytes of 
the connection.  If the method is POST, read the rest of the connection 
unbuffered and hand the socket off to the script.  Otherwise, do large 
block reads and buffer all you'd like.  If you seek the ultimate in 
performance, the extra code might be worth it.

Make the common case fast,

Exactly.  My suggestion was for a quick hack to halve the processing
time.  What you suggest is the right way to fix it.  Note that you
can read more than 4 bytes.  Assume generosity on what your server
accepts, the minimal HTTP/1.0 request is  "GET / HTTP/1.0<LF><LF>".
16 bytes.  That will still work with HTTP/0.9 requests since the
record boundary will cut your read short, if necessary.

Yes... let's nip this sort of thing in the bud, shall we?

HTTP is not Internet Mail. HTTP is a protocol based on a reliable byte
stream, such as TCP. A reliable byte stream does not munge
whitespace. It doesn't lose characters because it translated to EBCDIC
and back.

HTTP is not for the human eye: it's for a piece of software that groks
TCP (or perhaps some other reliable transport eventually...).

It is not the case that there are 1000s of broken HTTP implementations
out there that we need to support. There are perhaps 10 or 20, with 2
or 3 represending 99% of the traffic.

Let us keep the HTTP protocol clear and free of such kludgery.

In the HTTP headers, A line is terminated by CRLF. That's octet 13,
octet 10. Anything else is broken. One should not expect to use
idioms such as:
	printf("HearderName: stuff\n")
or
	echo "HeaderName: stuff"
successfully. Care must be taken to terminate lines with CRLF.

Similarly for the blank line that ends the headers: I'm not sure if
RFC822 specifies that the line shall be empty or not, but I'd support
a clarification in HTTP that says it shall.

The data stream is something different altogether. The possible
content-transfer-encodings are:
	7bit -- 7bit text, lines terminated by CRLF (no reason to use this)
	8bit -- 8bit text, lines terminated by CRLF
	binary -- 8bit data, not necessarily any linebreaks anywhere.

I believe binary is the default Content-Transfer-Encoding in HTTP
(though I believe I saw 8bit documented as the default somewhere...).

This means, for example, that you shouldn't expect html lines to
be terminated in any particular way. Of course it doesn't matter how
they're terminated except inside PRE elements. There, I'd say that
a newline is (CR|LF|CRLF).

Nope, thank goodness.  A long time ago I complained that c.i.w had a
higher SNR than the mailing list (since the mailing list tended to
consist largely of subscription requests, unsubscription requests,
info requests...)  Now the situation is otherwise.

Note that www-talk is gatewayed into the newsgroup cern.www.talk.  It
is gatewayed with distribution of "cern" but makes its way outside of
there anyway; for instance, we get it on our news server here, and
we're a few miles away from CERN. :-)  I just read traffic (a few days
behind) on the newsgroup and forget the list (I never was able to
unsubscribe successfully, so I just set my receiving hooks to delete

Sure!  Quoting from the Python FAQ, (ir)regularly posted to
comp.lang.python:

1.1. Q. What is Python?

A. Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very
high level dynamic data types, and classes.  Python combines
remarkable power with very clear syntax.  It has interfaces to many
system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and
is extensible in C or C++.  It is also usable as an extension language
for applications that need a programmable interface.  Finally, Python
is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on the Mac, and on
MS-DOS.

To find out more, the best thing to do is to start reading the
tutorial from the documentation set (see a few questions further
down).

1.3. Q. How do I obtain a copy of the Python source?

A. The latest Python source distribution is always available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.cwi.nl [192.16.184.180] in the directory
/pub/python, with filename python<version>.tar.gz.  (Old versions may
have an extension of .Z, indicating use of "compress" compression.)
It is a gzip'ed tar file containing the complete C source, LaTeX
documentation, Python library modules, example programs, and several
useful pieces of freely distributable software.  This will compile and
run out of the box on most UNIX platforms.  At the time of writing,
<version> is 1.0.2.  (See section 7 for non-UNIX information.)

1.4. Q. How do I get documentation on Python?

A. The latest Python documentation set is always available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.cwi.nl [192.16.184.180] in the directory
/pub/python, with filename pythondoc-ps<version>.tar.gz.  It is a
gzip'ed tar file containing PostScript files of the reference manual,
the library manual, and the tutorial.  At the time of writing
<version> is 1.0.2.  Note that the library manual is the most
important one of the set, as much of Python's power stems from the
standard or built-in types, functions and modules, all of which are
described here.  PostScript for a high-level description of Python is
in the file nluug-paper.ps.

The following sites keep mirrors of the Python distribution:

Site			IP address 	Directory

gatekeeper.dec.com	16.1.0.2	/pub/plan/python/cwi
ftp.uu.net		192.48.96.9	/languages/python
ftp.wustl.edu		128.252.135.4	/graphics/graphics/sgi-stuff/python
ftp.funet.fi		128.214.6.100	/pub/languages/python (old?)
ftp.fu-berlin.de	130.133.4.50	/pub/unix/languages/python (*python* only)

Or try archie on e.g. python1.0 to locate the nearest copy of that
version...

1.5. Q. Is there a newsgroup or mailing list devoted to Python?

A. There is a newsgroup, comp.lang.python, and a mailing list.  The
newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed into each other -- if you can
read news it is not necessary to subscribe to the mailing list.  Send
e-mail to python-list-request@cwi.nl to (un)subscribe to the mailing
list.

I agree 100%, and this raises an important point for implementors:  "be
conservative in what you send, but liberal in what you accept."

Specifically, implementations should NOT assume that the far end is 
strictly conforming to the standard.  Failure to do so can result in 
nasty surprises and *security holes*.  This is a good place to invest
in defensive programming.

As an example, here's NCSA's HTTPD code for parsing '%' escaped sequences 
in URLs and arguments (sorry to pick on you again, Rob):

    for(x=0,y=0;url[y];++x,++y) {
        if((url[x] = url[y]) == '%') {
            url[x] = x2c(&url[y+1]);
            y+=2;
        }
    }

This code assumes that the '%' is always followed by two characters.  If it 
isn't (i.e. the '%' is one of the last two characters in the string), the 
loop will jump past the null at the end of the string.  The result is a 
garbage error message, a core dump, or worse, the beginnings of a 
stack-overwriting security hole.  Try typing "GET %" at your server 
implementation.

>Let us keep the HTTP protocol clear and free of such kludgery.

One of the best ways to enforce standard implementations is to have a good 
test suite that checks for conformance.

Is there any way for an http server to find out exactly what machine name
was in the URL used to access it?  I looked in the NCSA httpd code, and it
didn't look like it could get any info outside of the "GET / HTTP1.0"
information.  Basically, I'd like to set things up so that, for example,
http://jekyll.com/ and http://hyde.com/ return different root-level
indices, despite the fact that jekyll.com is a CNAME for hyde.com. (domain
names used for demonstration purposes only :)) Since that sort of DNS name
conversion takes place in the client, I'm not optimistic that it can get
this info, but I thought I'd ask.

Yup, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen is. It's going to be completely

He's also putting in multipart MIME handling.  Mail Henrik

This is not always possible.  For instance, the Interpedia project basically
boils down to complicated database queries with the responses returned as
virtual HTML documents.  In many cases, it is _not possible_ for the client
to predict what its next query will be until it receives the response from
the last query.

While I understand and agree with the basic HTTP model being lightweight,
stateless, and clean, the fact is that complicated operations often require
some complexity to implement properly.  You said it yourself:

Scott> This doesn't exist yet, but could be requested in the future--let's
Scott> think ahead!

I agree!  Think ahead!  Further modifications to HTTP should include the
ability to perform multiple queries and transfers without specifying them
entirely beforehand.

I'm currently using another port to perform the database queries using an
intermediate script (ie, the client asks for something, a gateway then makes
a complicated set of queries on another port, and returns the results to the
client).  This will likely turn out pretty well, but I'm looking down the
road and thinking it would be cleaner to move some of the stuff directly
into HTTP.  For instance, the client requests some information, and gets too
much information returned.  It then wants to apply a URC (or SOAP) to the
previous query to narrow the search.

If the protocol is completely stateless (as any MIME-oriented MGET proposal
is), it will have to resend the entire query, forcing the server to do all
the processing again.  Only in a stateful protocol can this be implemented
cleanly and efficiently.

Get Perl, and install the excellent Perl Scripts for handling URLs and
HTTP stuff. Here's the header of htget:

# hget          --- get an html page from an http server
#
# Oscar Nierstrasz 26/8/93 oscar@cui.unige.ch
#
# This script and friends can be found at:
# http://cui_www.unige.ch/ftp/PUBLIC/oscar/scripts/README.html
# or ftp: cui.unige.ch:/PUBLIC/oscar/scripts/

This is probably exactly what you need.

Cheers,

Hello,
I would like to know if:
- the HTML+ Document Format, Internet Draft Dt. 28h October, 1993, still current- the HTML+ specification supercedes (obsoletes) the HTML spec; I mean can one
  concentrate entirely on the HTML+ for implementing a browser for WWW client
- Has there been any Internet RFC published or the above mentioned Draft 
  upgraded? the Internet Draft on HTML+ document format specifies the expiry 
  date as 1st May, 1994. What should one use at present?

Lastly, where do I request for a membership to this discussion list?

Thanks very much for your time, in deed.

The CGI spec says that if a query string does not contain an = character,
then the server passes it as a command-line parameter to the script (as
well as providing it in the QUERY_STRING environment variable).

The QUERY_STRING environment variable contains the undecoded query
information (ie %xx is not interpreted).

Should the query string be decoded before being passed to the script on
the command line?

(I would argue that it should be decoded.)

Second question - what is the difference between CGI/1.0 and CGI/1.1?

I have decided to drop the Best Browser category from the Best of the Web for
a number of reasons, among them: popularity vs. quality issues, variance
between platforms, lack of information, large number of competitive browsers,
etc.

Instead, I think it would be valuable for one of us (I could be involved, but
don't have the time to spearhead it) to do a comprehensive comparison of the
WWW Browsers out there (PD and Commercial).  This could be a central site for
people looking for one, or wondering what the most current version is and
where to get it.

More than a simple compendium like the rest we see out there (i.e. the WWW FAQ),
this would have a detailed head-to-head comparison of features, with screenshots
to show interfaces and such.  The Mosaic debate last week on c.i.www (which is
becoming something of a cesspool) shows how ignorant the larger www community
is about what browsers are available and what they do.

Would anyone like to work with me on this?

>entirely beforehand.

I'm working on an application that would take advantage of this sort of
capability, but I don't think it requires abandonment of statelessness.  My
experience so far tells me that when the user wants to perform multiple
queries and transfers, it's because they are somehow related to one
another.  I'm attacking that problem by passing parameters, which are kept
by the *browser* and re-sent.  I see the need for improvement of the
browsers' ability to keep track of queries and such, based on interaction,
rather than a need to change the servers' capabilities in that area.

There are several examples of outline interfaces (one of the capabilities
that I'm working on) that allow a variety levels of expansion in
subheadings.  At first glance, you'd think that that would require the
server to record the state of the outline, but the people who've done it
actually just create an document that contains a list of parameters
describing the outline's state, then pass those parameters back to the
server on each subsequent query.  I can dig up URLs for examples if they're
wanted.

There's no reason that the subsequent query can't pass back to the server a
set of parameters that describes the previous search results, to which new
narrowing or widening parameters can be added.

I guess another way I can say this is that you don't have to send the whole
query back, merely a description of it or a description of the results.

But as I think about this, I can imagine that eventually the results might
become quite complex, using up a lot of bandwidth to pass.  But again, the
solution isn't necessarily to store a state.  The server could simply cache
search results so that if it sees a duplicate search request, it already
has the results on hand.  It becomes a performance issue rather than a
statefulness issue... and I'd much rather predict that performance will
improve than to bet that we can guess what kind of statefulness should be
built into the servers.

Finally, just to throw a different vocabulary on this, I think about it as
"transaction" v. "session" models.  In a transaction model, there's user
interaction at every step; in a session model, the browser carries out a
series of recorded or defined steps.  This is coming from my experience
with CompuServe, where the two models are well-defined and widely used.
CompuServe is almost stateless.  And I hasten to add that *the* biggest FAQ
in a forum is "why did my message disappear," which is a result of the fact
that the system records the users' last message read and by default doesn't
show any messages before that number during the users' next session --
including any messages that he or she might have posted.  See what having a
stateful server does?  ;-)

What's the difference between "recording state" and "describing the state"?
In general, the examples and discussion in your message seem exactly like
recording state to me.

I don't really think of HTTP and gopher as "stateless" protocols, although I
use that terminology.  They're not "stateless"; rather, you are simply
tracking the state on the client side instead of on the server side.  What I
am claiming is that allowing state to be recorded _only_ on the client, thus
requiring two transfers on the state information for every change in state,
can lead to very inefficient applications.  HTTP should provide a mechanism
to allow the developer to decide where to record the state.

Nick> I guess another way I can say this is that you don't have to send the
Nick> whole query back, merely a description of it or a description of the

But in many cases, a description of the results is as large as the search
results.  And in Interpedia queries, there may be large parts of the data
structure that were constructed, but not returned in the final answer.  I'm
saying that I might want to retroactively tweak the search parameters so
that those items become an answer to the search.  Thus, merely describing
the results is not sufficient.

Nick> again, the solution isn't necessarily to store a state.  The server

Then the server is storing the state.  The problem is that recording the
search results can suck up an enormous amount of space very fast.  And I'm
talking about performing searches, but with little tweaks to the parameters.
This means I need to keep around the entire data structure that I
constructed to arrive at the previous search.  Caching of results is not
sufficient for this application.  As far as I can tell, the only clean way
to perform these kinds of operations are with stateful protocols.

Hmmm, I guess I could maintain the inherently stateless nature of HTTP and
instead maintain some transaction identifiers.  That is to say, the HTTP
server keeps all the data structures for all the searches around, and knows
which one to work with based on the transaction id sent by the client.  This
might work, although the communication model will have to be changed, since
you'll lose the file descriptor when you drop the connection.  Maybe some
other form of IPC would be appropriate.  Does anyone have any experience
with using transaction IDs in an inherently stateless protocol?

  We need the User-Agent header for a number of reasons - most particularly
for remaining backwards-compatible with older clients as the technology
continues to develop.  I don't believe that Mosaic currently sends it, and I
know that violaWWW does.  What about the other clients?  Is there any will out

Mosaic 2.4 sends User-Agent:, and earlier versions may send it as well.

However, it isn't designed for machine consumption.  The format isn't 
specified, and the HTTP spec even says "This is for statistical purposes and 
the tracing of protocol violations."  In other words, good luck trying to 
guess what the client's capabilities are based on that string.

There are much cleaner ways to deal with backwards-compatibility:

    - use new MIME datatypes (for new versions of HTML, for example) in the 
      request Accept: headers

    - Rev. the protocol when it changes.  HTTP already has a version number 
      field that will change when the next version of HTTP comes out.

Is there something that you are trying to do (or a problem that you 
anticipate) that doesn't fit into this framework?

  Mosaic for X sends it, but in a totally broken way.  According to the
spec, there should be at most two tokens on the line.  Something like:

User-Agent: XMosaic/2.4; libwww/version#

  Mosaic sends:

User-Agent: NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System/2.4; libwww/version#

  Not exactly adherent. :) Easy enough to change though.  mo-www.c needs to
change char*HTAppName = "Mosaic-X";

  Emacs-w3, violaWWW, and lynx all send the correct User-Agent field.

cjm> By the way, 'Referer:' would be nice too.

  Emacs-w3 and lynx are the only ones I know of that implement this
already.

  I can volunteer a little time...

The things that should be compared are:

1. Forms support
   a. Basics (text, checkbox, radio, menus, etc)
   b. Full (error checking, multiple Submit buttons with possibly distinct
      ACTIONS, scribblle and audio)

2. Entity support
   a. All the HTML+ entities?
   b. Graphical entities?

3. Emphasis supported
   a. Logical emphasis <em role=xxx> </em>
   b. Generic emphasis tag
   c. Additional HTML+ emphasis tags (sub, sup, strike)

4. Images
   a. <IMG> tag
   b. Figures
   c. ISMAP support
   d. Types of images supported (extensible?)
   e. Delaying of images (easy to restrict?)

5. Fun stuff
   a. NOTEs, footnotes
   b. Tables
   c. Maths

6. Extensibility
   a. Ease of changing formatting
   b. Mapping file extensions to MIME types
   c. Specifying viewers on MIME types

7. Portability
   a. Range of platforms it runs on
   b. Ease of porting to a new platform/toolkit (Motif->Athena, X->Windows,
      etc)

8. Browser specific goodies
   a. Enhancements specific to the one browser (x-exec urls, posting news,
      grokking a users newsrc, etc)

There are probably more, but these are the biggies.

The HIDDEN attribute of FORMs was added as a means for passing out-of-band
information such as session id's back and forth.  The intent, I believe, is
that such info is just part of the data as far as HTTP is concerned, so the
protocol remains stateless.

Browser developers should anticipate the likelihood that this attribute may
be very large relative to the values of most other attributes.  That is, don't
assume that an attribute value is always going to be small.

I don't think the HIDDEN mechanism solves all the problems with our current
client-server transaction model, however.  I believe that browsers will need to
provide and advertise a 'callback port' when they access certain services.
This would avoid the client having to wait and/or poll a server when some
request takes a long time to process.

Can we please avoid 'callback ports' as they are a real pain through 
firewalls.   Let's just use multithreaded clients instead and just
let that one thread wait until the server is ready.

One advantage of server statelessness is that it allows backtracking  
in the browser to work correctly for interactive pages.  Storing all  
state in the client (through hidden fields) effectively gives the  
user complete undo capability.  This can make statelessness very  
useful despite the setup lag incurred at the server.

HTTP definitely has room to improve as a distributed application  
protocol (in terms of latency, load balancing, etc).  But this needs  
to be thought through very carefully before the stateless model is  
abandoned.

This is quite true IMHO.  It begs the question why are people so intent on
using a stateless protocol for doing inherently non-stateless operations? 
HTTP isn't as far as I'm aware intended to become the One True
Protocol(tm) such that nobody will implement anything else.  If you need
stateful transactions, why not come up with a separate stateful protocol
rather than breaking the clean statelessness of HTTP which has been so
useful to date?

              (the latest I have is the Internet Draft Standard Oct'93)
secondly, is there any formal syntax (like BNF) defined for HTML+

There's been already some effort going on in this area, viz. on the NIR
list (nir@mailbase.ac.uk) and the UNITE list (unite@mailbase.ac.uk;
subscribe through mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk). In particular, there are some
evaluations of WWW browsers available in the UNITE archive
<URL:gopher://nisp.ncl.ac.uk/11/lists-u-z/unite/files/>. You may even
search the unite archive at
<URL:gopher://mailbase.ac.uk/77/lists/unite/.waisindex/files>.

I guess you'll find a willing audience for more evaluations there.

In addition to the good list that Bill Perry constructed, I would add mail

to clients and also to drop a resource e-mail message while in the browser.  
I also would think that the help files integrated into a browser should be 
compared.

Nothing has been "published" on this front for some time...
But there are documents online:

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html
(see also:
	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/drafts/htmlplus-comments.html )

And the rumors of the demise of HTML have been greatly exaggerated.
Expect to see a spec with wide support soon. Sorry I can't be more
specific, but you can consult my design notebook:

	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/drafts/html-design.html

which includes my working DTD and a test suite for HTML.

>secondly, is there any formal syntax (like BNF) defined for HTML+ 
>          Markup language? 

Nope. There's a DTD for HTML+, but there are also comments in the
spec that say that the DTD is not and _exact_ description of HTML+.


HTML will continue to be defined in strict compliance with SGML.
(How it's implemented is, of course, a different story... :-)

>thirdly, what is DTD and how can one use it to build parsers?

Welcome to SGML! Seriously... get the sgmls package and some
of the other goodies from:

	ftp://ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/

>lastly, what is Pageless mode in HTMLPLUS?

Can't help you there... Dave?

Not yet, but the latest proposal can be found in
<ftp://15.254.100.100/pub>

 |secondly, is there any formal syntax (like BNF) defined for HTML+ 
 |          Markup language? 

Yes, the HTML+ DTD (`Document Type Definition') is in fact a Context
Free Grammar, though not BNF. The SGML standard describes how to
interpret the DTD and how to insert delimiters in the document.

 |thirdly, what is DTD and how can one use it to build parsers? and

See above. The HTML+ DTD is a grammar for HTML+ documents. To build a
parser, you either use a general SGML parser and specialize it, or
convert the DTD to a yacc grammar. There may be parser generators that
work directly from DTDs, but I'm not sure.

 |lastly, what is Pageless mode in HTMLPLUS?

I don't know. As far as I know HTML+ doesn't have the concept of page.

    Alan> I'm about to do some server/os/platform benchmarking, and
    Alan> the following issues come to mind:

I've been doing a lot of work on benchmarking http servers, so I might
as well share my experiences.

I have written a program called web-killer for systems with posix compliant
threads. web-killer takes as arguments a list of partial urls with their
relative frequencies, a host/port to connect to, and paramaters indicating
the number of concurrent sessions to start, plus the number of queries 
each session should generate. 

The program starts the appropriate number of threads; the threads then
randomly generate queries according to the frequency distribution pattern 
supplied. 

For my test frequencies, I've been using 7 months of log data from sunsite; the
test servers have been pointing at the sunsite data area. I haven't been
using inter-query separation information from the logs, as unfortunately that
is dependent on the system load, not the rate of query arrival. 

The methodology has a few flaws; 

Firstly, more URLs occur in load groups; when
one of the files is accessed, it will immediately trigger several more load 
requests; this is not reflected in the query generator (and since I'm about
to start optimising for this, I'm bloody well going to benchmark it :-)

Secondly; queries are generated from a single machine, so logging may not be
a factor. Also, slowness on the generating machine may affect the results.

I've been using this program to test the multi-threaded httpd I'm writing
for solaris, and the results are pretty good; despite discovering some 
really nasty bugs in Solaris 2.3, not all of which are fixed, I can get 
average response times up to 100 times better than ncsa httpd under sunos
4.1.3 for the proof of concept version (i.e. without smart caching and 
pre-fetch). (Oh, and for those of you thinking of using cached NFS for 
web data; I don't recommend it.) TCP/IP on solaris 2.4 is a lot lot better than
2.3, so most of the performance leaks should go away.

Although the proposed hacks to TCP for transaction processing will make
this better, it does seem to me that adding support for multiple 
transactions over the same connection would be a big win. Using MIME is 
not a very good solution in this case, as the vast bulk of all secondary 
transactions are binary files, and having to scan through byte by byte
for the end marker is a major  lose.

What we have here is a textbook case of where a session protocol is 
actually useful; fortunately we have a good example to look at when 
designing a session protocol. All we have to do is look at the OSI session,
and then make sure to do exactly the opposite. Since OSI session has every
possible design flaw in there somewhere, all that's left is  perfection :)

As a first cut, how about something like the following (this is vaguely 
similar to IMAP in the way that each transaction has an ID associated with
it, to allow requests and responses to be streamed.

    The following new features have been added/changed:

Please see http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_lynx/lynx2-3.html
for more details on new features.

* Revamped the FTP code to recognize different server types and to parse
  full directory listings (LIST output).  File types, sizes and dates
  are displayed when possible.
* Popup menus are now supported for non-multiple <select> lists.
* Added "action=" handling to ISINDEX tags.  (Is that in the spec?)
* Fixed (added) the delete-a-bookmark command and bound it to 'r' for remove.
  (thanks to David Trueman for the fix)
* added transparent support for mosaic bookmark files.  Just point
  Lynx at your existing default mosaic bookmark file in the O)ptions
  menu and Lynx will handle the rest.  Viewing, addition, and removal 
  of hotlist items are supported.
* fixed Telnet security problem
* added second line of reverse video to show multiline links better.
* Added configurable MIME types and viewers to lynx.cfg.  MIME types
  and VIEWERS can be configured by following the instructions within
  the newest lynx.cfg file.
* Added .mailcap and mailcap support as well as mime.types support
  for the configuration of viewers and extension mappings.
  The test command is now implemented so that viewers can be conditionally
  setup.  Either the lynx.cfg method or the mime.types/.mailcap method
  may be used for configuration.
* Added second %s argument to PRINTER and DOWNLOADER definitions.
  If a second %s is present in the command definition it will be
  filled in by a suggested filename which is derived from the URL
  of the document.  See lynx.cfg for more details.
* Got code from CERN to fix HTBTree FTP bug.  Large ftp lists should
  not crash anymore.
* Added no_proxy environment variable.  Set it to a comma delimited list
  of domains or hosts that should not be proxyed. (Thanks CERN :)
  USAGE: (UNIX)
     setenv no_proxy "domain1.dom, domain2.dom, domain3, etc"
* Lynx now exports the environment variable LYNX_VERSION on UNIX systems
  with the current version number as the value.
* Fixed Referer: field handling so that it doesn't crash on really
  long URL's

Subject: Pretty URLs
content-length: 1395

Hi-

Consider the case where an HTML document can be accessed through several
different paths, one of which is through an <ISMAP> inlined image click,
and another through a logical tree structure.

Currently, the mosaic client displays the URL of whatever route to the
page is taken, and that is what is saved in the hotlist if the user chooses 
to save the URL.  We would like to create the condition (without hacking the
server and client) where we can put the direct link URL to the page in the 
hotlist instead of saving the map coordinate URL.

Does anyone know if it is possible in HTTP for the server to specify an 
equivalent URL to be both displayed in the mosaic URL window and saved in the 
hotlist if the user chooses to do so?

Have issues like this been put off until the UR* groups have completed their 
work?

thanks,

-marc

  Doesn't this incur the cost of another HTTP transaction?

  What about the URI: header in the response? (see the http spec_ for
  details) Is this honored by Mosaic? If so, you could use that.
  If not, I guess the above suggestion is the only thing that works for
  now.

  Please write "Using MIME multipart/* syntax is not a very good
  solution..."

  MIME multipart/* syntax is designed for use in Internet Mail and
  USENET news, where a reliable bytestream is not guaranteed.

  In the context of HTTP, something like application/tar (or
  application/bento) would be more appropriate. Consider:

  User selects the following anchor:

	<p>For complete details, see
	<cite><A HREF="http://host.com/reports/r100.tar#top.html">
	Report 100
	</A></cite>


  Client connects to host.com and tells the server it prefers
  text/html, image/gif, and application/tar, but it will take
  postscript, tiff, and multipart/mixed:

	GET /reports/r100.tar HTTP/1.0
	Accept: text/plain; q=0.7, text/html; q=1.0
	Accept: image/gif; q=1.0, image/x-tiff; q=0.7
	Accept: application/postscript; q=0.8
	Accept: application/tar; q=1.0, multipart/mixed; q=0.9


  Server looks for /reports/r100.tar in its filesystem, but doesn't
  find it. It does, however, find a directory called /reports/r100,
  and it knows how to convert a directory to a tar file. It may write
  the tar file to disk and cache it (and hence be able to tell the
  client the Content-Length before hand), or it may just pipe the tar
  output right over the wire. (NOTE: the server must check that all
  the constituents are Accept:able to the client)

	200 document follows
	Content-Type: application/tar
	Content-Length: 81920

	...tar file...

  Client receives the tar file, and either stores it in memory or
  writes it to local disk (probably broken into constituent files). It
  knows that fragment identifiers in application/tar entities refer to
  the contituent files.  So it resolves #top.html and displays
  top.html. _AND_ it can resolve relative links from top.html to the
  other parts of the tar archive. So all the <image SRC="xxx.gif">
  files get displayed without any more HTTP transactions.


  The only part of the architecture that needs to change is that this
  strategy requires that the decision of whether to send just the
  .html node or to send the whole collection of files is made by the
  author of the link when s/he writes:

	HREF=http://host.com/reports/r100.tar#top.html"

  ... and that decision should probably be negociated between the
  client and the server based on file sizes, user preferences such as
  "delay image loading", etc.

  I would argue that the long-term solution is richer linking markup.
  But I don't have the whole argument put together just yet...


  MIME, Mosaic, and WWWLibrary
------------------------------

  Does anybody else think it's funky that Mosaic treats message/rfc822
  body parts three different ways?

* If you give a file: reference to a file ending in .mime, it launches
  metamail

* If you give a news: reference, it formats the headers as HTML,
  and displays the body as plain text (no matter what the content-type
  is)

* If the message is an HTTP response, it hides the headers (even the
  interesting ones like Last-Modified:) and displays the body
  according to the content-type.

  Why are these three cases not handled the same way? (or very nearly
  the same... message/http should probably have slightly different
  semantics from message/rfc822)

  And what the heck is "www/mime"? The name refers to the same thing
  that is called message/rfc822 in MIME parlance.

Subject: Auto-Download tags/function?
content-length: 895

Not sure whether this has been discussed before, but...

I'm interested in some sort of tag or code which alerts the browser that a
particular file is for downloading to the local machine only, such as .zip
or .hqx files, so when the link is clicked, it automatically activates the
"load to disk" or similar function and prompts for destination on the local
drive(s).

Is this a feature which exists? If not, is it a reasonable concept?

I'm aware that if configured correctly, some browsers can do the above when
a certain type of document is called, but this is a manual switch not all
users will be aware of.

The idea would be to simplify the browser interface options for users,
limiting certain documents to downloading only.

Has this been discussed?  Is it a reasonable option?

Would the Location header do for that? If the imagemap program gave out 
transparent redirects, I suspect that might solve the problem.

A looooooong time ago, I suggested:

	<A HREF="ftp://host/file.tar.Z" CONTENT-TYPE="application/x-tarZ">
	a tar file</a>

which would be enough information for the browser to decide that
the tar file is not something it can display in the reading window.

The concept was introduced in the MIME RFC. I thought we should
use it. I got vetoed, cuz timbl (and others) thought such things belong in
the protol. But this rules out FTP as a protocol. But wait! we
do use FTP protocol. So we end up with the current broken situation.

I still think I was right ;-)

So do I; the protocol has to be told somewhere about such files, and having
a separate control file listing "this file should be handled that way" would
be an administrative nightmare.  I don't know of another way to handle the
situation, but the current way is, putting it very mildly, undesirable.

Then make it obvious in the browser.  For example, you could put a little
disk icon beside each link (I wouldn't personally care for that
but I'm just showing you some of the options).

With recent versions of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System users can
specify they want certain types of data to be saved to a file and
not viewed in their .mailcap files.  For example:
    video/quicktime; mosiac-internal-dump %s

I *do* think that browsers should be able to save to a file after they
download the data and "view" it.

Ehm, I realize the question asks for an HTTP solution, but if you are
sending HTML, can't the <BASE> tag be used?  Or is that deprecated?

Yes, this feature have been available for some time.  It existed in
Mosaic 1.x for X in hack form:  URLs ending in ".saveme" or ".dump"
automatically activated its "save file" dialog box.  It is in there
(and in lynx and probably others) in a more reasonable form.  The
MIME type "application/octet-stream" causes a save-file dialog.

I use it quite a bit; see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ftp for one example.

So it all boils down to convincing your server to send the right
MIME type.  You can add a new suffix, say ".dump" for application/octet-stream
and do things like:

	ln -s file.gif file.dump

However, that raises a small issue in what the browser gives as a default
name for the file.  You'd rather have "file.gif" than "file.dump".
One possibility I explored that if "_download_" appears in the local
file name, it triggers the app../oct.. MIME type.  So you can do stuff
like:

	mkdir _download_; cd _download_
	ln -s ../*.gif .

In the best of all worlds, the browsers would understand

	Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="foo.gif"

and life would be easier.

    This is easy.  Have the ISMAP return a redirection to the desired URL.
Of course this means you'll have to connect twice...

   Yes, but this is not what I would call a good way to use the viewer
field of the mailcap.  Anybody else out there think Mosaic (and all other
browsers) should use an X-xxxx field in the mailcap for this?  Something

Subject: Testing accounts for ViolaWWW
content-length: 1333

In order to do better testings and support of ViolaWWW, I would like 
to solicit donations for guest accounts on the major Unix platforms. 
(excuse me for asking this on the list, but...)

At this point, this means anything not close to SunOS 4.1.3 and Ultrix 4.2
which I have access to, and paticularly (but not limited to!) the AIX R6000,
Dec Alpha, HP Snake, and SGI systems.

Here's the deal:

* You give me a guest account, say for atleast 3 months, on a machine 
  that I can access via the net.

* I'll restrict my use of the account to viola related portability 
  testings, like making sure that viola compiles and runs on the platform.
  I'll probably do this only just before releases.

* You'll get updated ViolaWWW executable.

* Acknowledgement in the Viola credits list, and appreciation of the 
  users who're current having trouble compiling viola on the particular
  platforms.


So, if your organization has some CPU crunchies to spare, good network 
connectivity, don't have a firewall, want to help viola development, etc,
please drop me a note. Based mostly on network connectivity, I'll select
one (or maybe two) offer(s) for each different platform.

Thanks.

Different systems (protocols) need different methods to determine this
sort of thing. I don't see why a broswser couldn't use filenames
extensions as a type indication when using FTP only.  After all that
is how a manual FTP session works.

As Martijn says, ``content-type'' should not be a special keyword in the
anchor because it's not an attribute of the link.  If the protocol *can't*
type the data then the URL should allow some place to define this.  E.g.:
    <A HREF="ftp://host/file.tar.Z;{content-type=application/x-tarZ};">
Simply stated, protocol dependent parts should go in the URL space.

A ***BIG*** problem with the URL space right now is that it's not
extensible!!!!  So we can't add this without breaking things somewhat.
That issue really needs to be addressed.

The only solutions that I can see are to make it heuristic and define a
syntax that isn't likely to break any existing URLs, or add new protocol
types.  Either way, all browsers would have to be updated before we could
start using the new syntax but the sooner the better I would say.
Geez, what a mess.

So if we use something like ``;{...};'' that isn't likely to appear
in current URLs then we can remain 99.9% backwards compatible.
    ftp://host/path/file;{attr=value,value;attr=value};

New protocol types using attr/value pairs might look something like:
    anon-ftp:h=hostname:p=port:p=/pub/README:content-type=application/x-tarZ

BTW: (need I say it?) *IF* we go with something like the above the HTTP
request format would NOT change.  The additional information would go in
the headers somewhere.

OK. Stick it in the URL. As long as it can go in the source anchor
somewhere, I'm happy. I generally like the idea of using the SGML
parser to handle syntactic issues, but if folks like to use the
URL syntax cuz it's short and sweet, that's fine by me...

>A ***BIG*** problem with the URL space right now is that it's not

>That issue really needs to be addressed.

This is one of the reasons why I wanted to use the SGML parser to
do these things... If we had coded URLs all along as:

	<A linkend=ftp1>link</a>
	<ftp id=ftp1 host="foo.com" dir="/abc" file="foo.txt">

then we could add this attribute to the FTP element with confidence
that we wouldn't be breaking anything.

On the other hand, a lot of folks would have said "What a pain!"
and perhaps WWW wouldn't be as popular as it is today... Who knows?

Well, the current spec reserves the characters ; and = for this
purpose. I don't know how many implementations comply, nor how
many existing URLs violate this constraint, but I support
the idea of allowing:

	ftp://host/path/file;attr=value;attr=value

>New protocol types using attr/value pairs might look something like:
>    anon-ftp:h=hostname:p=port:p=/pub/README:content-type=application/x-tarZ

First, I think anon-ftp is a bad example. anon-ftp: already exists...
it's just called ftp: most of the time :-). Second, I suggest the
slightly different syntax:

	scheme:/path;param=value;param=value

>BTW: (need I say it?) *IF* we go with something like the above the HTTP
>request format would NOT change.  The additional information would go in

Right. You can write:
	HREF="http://host/path"
and the client will tell the server all the content-types it Accepts:
Or you can write
	HREF="http://host/path;content-type=applicaiton/postscript"
and the client should tell the server that it will only Accept: the
postscript version of the document.

It's doable.

Maybe I lost track of the original objective, but why would you want
to do that with a HTTP URL? Tony suggested doing this as a fix for
protocols that cannot type the data, but HTTP can, and can even
negotiate it -- why would you want to switch that off?

I believe that a reference should be able to express:

	"See _the_postscript_version_ of document xxxx"

I think this is just a desirable feature that we don't have.

I beleive it must not be a private agreement between client and server,
so that, for instance, if a proxy server has the postscript version
cached, it can serve it up, even though there is a possibility that
the document exists in other formats on the original server.

What you propose should be solved using the URI: header.  URI: can tell
you the URL for *exactly* what you have now or it can tell which attributes
can be varied.  That's all it should need to know and that's a *LOT* more
information than coding a content-type in a URL *and* it doesn't break
existing practice.

I don't see how this is relevant.

The way I understand it, the URI: header is a way for the server
to tell the client "here's the name for the document I'm sending you.
It's available in these formats, and that's it."

I don't understand how that allows me to represent, in a document,
a link to a specific format of a document.

And about some earlier solutions...

All these ".dump", ".saveme" methods are fine if you own both ends of
the link. But what if the file you're linking to is on somebody
_else_'s FTP server? What if there's a report in postscript format,
and the filename doesn't end in .ps? Without the ability to express
the content type in the link, we're SOL.

Actually, the IETF "URL" working group has addressed an issue close
to yours for ftp: URLs.  They wanted to be specific, when possible,
about what FTP transfer mode to use and the command to use (is the
remote thing a file or a directory).  I may have the details wrong,
but the proposed solution was to add ";type=something" to the end
of the URL.  So you might have:

	ftp://host.dom/a/directory;type=dir
	ftp://host.dom/text/file;type=ascii
	ftp://host.dom/binary/file;type=image

Or whatever.  For ***FTP*** URLs this is reasonable and extending
that syntax to something like

	ftp://host.dom/binary/file;type=image;content-type=image/gif

seems reasonable enough.  I'm not so sure that dropping that syntax
onto HTTP URLs is a good idea.  If I can follow a link with my browser
that will give me back something that my browser can't deal with, I
won't be happy.  Such an extension may be acceptible if it means
"image/gif is the preferred format if my browser understand it".
That way, you could say "http://host/file;content-type=application/oct..."
and expect it to work since every browser can deal with that type.
But "http://host/file;content-type=application/postscript" may
not always work out.

If the link specifies a content type that the browser is incapable
of presenting, firstly, this condition can be detected before the
browser goes to all the trouble to retrieve the document.
Secondly, it's reasonable for the browser to say

	"This link says Postscript, but I don't grok postscript.
	You want I should see if the doc is available in a
	format that I do grok?"

It's even reasonable for the browser to assume the answer to
that question is yes (given suitable documentation, or better
yet -- a user settable preference).

What's not reasonable is:

	* I am browsing some X-rays, and I want to include a reference
	to one of them in my report. I write
		HREF="http://med.com/xrays/100"
	There are very subtle features in this x-ray, so I'd like
	folks that follow this link to get _excactly_ the bits
	I was looking at. Hmmm... I have no way of expressing
	this. Oh well, maybe it'll just work...

	* My colleage is browsing my report. His browser is set
	to "lean and mean mode" -- it prefers low-res images where
	available. He follows the link.

	* A caching proxy server grabs the original 48MB tiff,
	and decides it can reduce it to a 16K gif faster than
	it can send the 48MB graphic over the wire.

	* My colleage sees a low-res version of the x-ray, and
	misses the subtle details, and gets NO WARNING that
	the data has been compromised.

It's all about ensuring reliable communication with expressive
links and fault detection mechanisms.

>  Such an extension may be acceptible if it means
>"image/gif is the preferred format if my browser understand it".

Yes, this is the idea, except that it's much more useful in
the case where the author and the reader are different parties,
i.e. in the case where you want to say "image/gif is the
preferred format if _your_ browser understands it."

>That way, you could say "http://host/file;content-type=application/oct..."
>and expect it to work since every browser can deal with that type.

That's news to me! I read that support for text/plain and text/html
is required, but I have seen no HTTP (or any WWW technology) requirement
for support of application/octet-stream.

It's reasonable to expect most browsers to handle that type (except
"kiosk" style browsers, like the one you get when you telnet
to info.cern.ch, that have no disk space to write to), but I don't
think there are any specs that require it.

Yes, there are associated error conditions. But they are well
defined, and the increase in functionality merits the complication.

content-length: 7949


			   *  *  *  *  *

  CERN httpd is a generic hypertext server which can be used as a
  regular HTTP server running typically on port 80 to serve hypertext
  and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a firewall
  machine -- that provides access for people inside a firewall to the
  outside world.  When running as proxy httpd may be configured to
  do caching of documents resulting in faster response times and lower
  impact on the network traffic to the outside world.

			   *  *  *  *  *

CERN httpd 3.0pre5 is available, source code:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/cern_httpd.tar.Z

This package includes EVERYTHING, so don't ftp the libwww.
Precompiled binaries are supplied for Sun4, Solaris, HP, NeXT,
NeXT-386, Decstation Ultrix and DEC OSF/1 from:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin

Sun4 binary is compiled with direct WAIS support.

For Sun4 there is also a cern_httpd_3.0pre5-lresolv.tar.Z which
contains an httpd linked with the -lresolv option.

Online docs:
	http://info.cern.ch/httpd/

This is still a prerelease, so please go easy on us if you should
encounter problems.  Correct address to send email about CERN httpd
is:

                  CERN HTTPD 3.0 PRERELEASE NOTES 4-5

3.0 Prerelease 5
 
     * New cache configuration directive CacheRefreshInterval for
       specifying the maximum allowed time between consecutive up-to-date
       checks regardless of expiry date. This is good for cases when it
       is vital to always have the most up-to-date information even if
       expiry date has been approximated to be too far off.
     * CacheDefaultExpiry time no longer defaults to non-zero for FTP or
       Gopher - it is always zero. I am thus forcing proxy maintainers to
       explicitly set these values if they want to have FTP and Gopher
       cached.
     * Fixed the bug which caused proxy truncate binary HTTP0 responses.
     * Fixed the bug that in the configuration file it wasn't possible to
       do Map'pings onto a WAIS URL. Now it's possible to run httpd as a
       WAIS gateway as well as a WAIS proxy.
     * Fixed the bug with invalid last-modified fields confusing the
       caching system.
     * Fixed the bug with headers sometimes missing form the proxy reply
       even though the original reply was HTTP1.
     * Now passes proxy URL's that were un-Map'ped by the rule system as
       they came in; this will fix the problems with servers that insist
       on having their URL's encoded in a special, non-canonical form
       (e.g. dranet.dra.com).
     * Fixed the bug that caused temporary backup files with IMG-GET to
       be left behind (thanks to Shouichi Matsui for the fix).
     * Fixed the bug that in a cascade of proxies the first proxy would
       strip away the keywords.
     * Fixed the bug that a-umlaut character caused Gopher listings to be
       truncated.
     * Fixed the bug that daily garbage collection sometimes didn't
       start.
     * Fixed the ProxyAccessLog (new & broken in pre4).
     * Content-encoding with FTP works again; now clients can uncompress
       transparently again (broken since 3.0pre1).
     * README files in Directory listings containing "<", ">", and "&"
       are now parsed corectly.
     * Bug in FTP using short directory listings fixed. Also file sizes
       are now shown as "-" and not "0" as before.
     * FTP is now generally more robust and knows how to handle more
       servers like Windows NT and OS/2.
     * Multiline error messages understood by FTP.
     * Gopher now handles characters like "<" in file titles.
     * Error messages improved in Gopher, FTP and HTTP.
     * Improved the code for CSO Name Server via Gopher.
     * Added Sun3 to the BUILD script.

3.0 Prerelease 4
 
     * IMPORTANT: CacheDefaultExpiry, CacheUnused and CacheClean are
       now matched so that the first match is used, not the last one,
       e.g.:

        CacheDefaultExpiry  */cgi-bin/*  0
        CacheDefaultExpiry  */htbin/*    0
        CacheDefaultExpiry  *            12 hours

       now works as expected.
     * Direct WAIS support on the proxy works again; WAIS support can be
       compiled in by unpacking the freeWAIS-0.3 distribution in the same
       directory as WWW and compiling it, uncommenting appropriate lines
       from the platform specific makefile WWW/All/XXX/Makefile.include,
       and then doing the normal BUILD in directory WWW.
     * KeepExpired directive; if turned On the proxy will not remove
       expired HTTP documents from the cache during regular garbage
       collection but use up all the cache space, thus increasing the
       effectiveness of if-modified-since [documents that have expired
       are still usually not modified and become valid again after a
       check from remote server].
     * ProxyAccessLog for logging proxy accesses, i.e. accesses that were
       not satisfied by the server in normal HTTP server mode, but
       required an external connection from the proxy server.
     * FTPDirInfo Top | Bottom | Off directive for specifying the
       placement of FTP messages in FTP directory listings.
     * DirShowHTMLTitles Off can be used to disable HTML TITLEs in the
       directory listings.
     * Proxy process now lowers its priority when it's doing garbage
       collection, and when it's retrieving a document to cache but the
       requesting user has interrupted the connection (thanks to Peter
       Parnes for the idea!).
     * Linux changes by Matt Ranney, thank you!
     * Made socket lingering optional - in Linux it's causing problems,
       and according to somebody it's not necessary at all. If I'm wrong
       Linger On enables it again.
     * ISC 3.0 port, thanks to Lauren Weinstein for it!
     * Fixes the bug that standard icon set was initialized even when
       there were icon settings in the configuration file.
     * Added a kludge that sends a cursor-return and line-feed after CGI
       script input (for scripts that do line-oriented reading).
     * Nasty divide-by-zero situation and a random-memory-free in garbage
       collection fixed, thanks to Henrik Nordstrvm!
     * When a directory listing cache file (e.g. pub/www/src) gets moved
       when a link in that listing is followed (e.g. to
       pub/www/src/.cache_dirindex), a correct entry is now written to
       .cache_info file, so that index no longer expires immediately.
     * Directory browsing title/heading & parent directory link problem
       for both HTTP and FTP fixed; now always correctly shows the
       directory in the title, and gives the parent directory link for
       all the others except root directory.
     * Fixed the strange bug with large CGI script outputs having a MIME
       header both before and after the response (happened when
       MaxContentLengthBuffer size was exceeded).
     * FTP module now returns a timeout message correctly. And yes, we
       know that there are still weird FTP servers whose output is not
       understood.
     * DNSLookup directive for disabling the reverse DNS lookup to find
       out the remote DNS hostname for cases when DNS seems to be a
       bottleneck. Disabling this will naturally prevent the use of DNS
       name templates in access control, and results in plain IP numbers
       in the logfiles.
     * ServerType StandAlone | Inetd directive to select the server type.
       If not set will default to StandAlone if Port is defined or -p
       option used, otherwise to Inetd.

First of all, you don't want people creating links to specific formats,
that defeats the whole point of format negotiation.  Stored links should
be to the most varient form of the URI except in very special cases.

What proxies need to know is more about how format negotiation works so
they can short circut a request to a varient URI with something in the
cache but your proposal doesn't do anything to address that.  Right now
a cacheing proxy must use some kind of heuristic and that should possibly
be addressed.  I suppose the proxy would need some way to ask the
server about it's conversions.  That could get real nasty though
(how good, how fast, from what to what, etc).  Ugh!

If all you want is links to specific data sets URI: works like this.
Let's say you access http://www.bsdi.com/ and you get this back:
    Last-Modified: Sunday, 08-May-94 20:48:20 GMT
    Date: Thursday, 19-May-94 19:06:21 GMT
    URI: http://www.bsdi.com/; vary=content-type,version,language
    URI: http://www.bsdi.com/index; vary=content-type,version,language
    URI: http://www.bsdi.com/index.html; vary=language,version
    URI: http://www.bsdi.com/En_US/index.html; vary=version
    URI: http://www.bsdi.com/1.19/En_US/index.html
    Content-Language: en_US
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/html
Then you know that http://www.bsdi.com/1.19/En_US/index.html (for as long
as it's valid) will return the exact same bits as you have in your hand
right now and you know that those bits are text/html in en_US.
The format of the URL in this scheme is total up to the server, it could
just as well be ``URI: http://www.bsdi.com/12309872''.

Please explain and give a specific protocol transaction where your scheme
of encoding the content-type in a standard way inside the HTTP URL is any
better than this.

Ok... but I happen to be interested in "very special cases."

I believe the proposal addresses exactly that situation: if the
link gives the content type, then the proxy is free to ignore
the possiblity that there are other content types, and serve
up the cached copy. I guess you have to do the same thing for
version, language, ... . The number of variant axes must be
set in stone, or this doesn't work...

Ah! The lightbulb goes on! I thought the server would just give:
	URI: http://www.bsdi.com/; vary=content-type,version,language
and that's it. This business of giving lots of URI: headers certainly
does address some of my concerns. I'll have to meditate on it a while
to see if it solves the whole problem I'm interested in.

Nope. This is sufficient. It's nearly equivalent: it's just a question
of what's explicit where vs. what's implicit where.

Hmmm... it seems that putting type info in the link is still
useful for FTP, though.

Thanks for clearing this up for me.

Well, it still doesn't solve the proxy problem for the general case where
the link is to a varient URI where there is still no way for the proxy to
know that a document in the cache is the proper match.  Of course, you
can use heuristics for the general case and use ``Pragma: no-cache'' when
you need it done right.  I would still like someone to think about this
some more.

It also doesn't address some other points you made in another
posting, like testing for error conditions and user interface.
But content-type in the URL doesn't really solve those either.

> does address some of my concerns. I'll have to meditate on it a while

Yes, cogitate on that for a while and see what you come up with.
Don't forget that you need to consider image depth, resolution,
colomap, and a million other details when asking for "the same thing".

I don't see how you can do exactly what you want to do in a reasonable
enough way that it will ever be supported.  There are some good things
to think about in there though.

Yes, we've covered that.  There was never any doubt in my mind.
The current FTP URL space has a number of problems.

Isn't that a bit prescriptive? I would prefer to see this statement expressed 
thus:

"You don't want to force authors to link to specific formats every time, 
although that should be possible if that is what the author wants to do."

> that defeats the whole point of format negotiation.

In the particular case that started this thread (check the subject line) 
defeating format negotiation was precisely what the original poster wished to 
achieve, in a particular situation.

Also, I would say that format negotiation is not in place at the present time. 

OK, contentious I know, but: browsers do not support it, users cannot configure 
it, servers don't support it and information providers don't work that way.

(Just an observation. I am dealing with the majority here - if you happen to 
know of a proof of concept browser/server pair that does, my point still 
stands).

Furthermore, discussion on this list has shown that the issue of automatic 
format conversion, were it to be implemented, is complex. There are lots of 
special cases we don't want to debar just so that whgat is percieved as the 
common type of transfer will work correctly.

> Stored links should
> be to the most varient form of the URI except in very special cases

I believe that it is those very special cases that are the present topic of 
discussion.

> Right now

> be addressed.  I suppose the proxy would need some way to ask the

I would refer you back to the recent discussion on image format conversion in 
the context of cacheing proxies, where this is discussed.

> That could get real nasty though
> (how good, how fast, from what to what, etc).  Ugh!

That was the general consensus, I believe, along with the realisation that 
'good' was a vector not a scalar. There also seemed to be some agreement that 
the best person to know what conversions and degradations were acceptable, on a 
case by case basis, was the author of the document who understands the actual 
meaning of each document, image, etc.

I can readily see that linking to non-specific versions would be the right thing 
in the default case, where a well chosen set of defaults will provide adequate 
results most of the time, and allowing the author to specify a particular file 
in cases where it matters should be a supported option. Equally, allowing an 
author to override the type of a known file for particular reasons is also 
catered for in Dan's suggestion.

Perhaps someone could post an example where the URI spec helps clear up the 
various example situations that have been posted in previous threads, such as 
medical images, prepress images, etc while still doing the right thing in 
typical situations where converting, say, an iris RGB to a Q=50 JPEG is a good 
and proper thing to do.

Sender: mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu
content-length: 4899

Mailcaps have a great deal of promise as a mechanism for centralizing
configuration information about handling MIME content-types,
permitting a variety of programs to successfully handle new items
with a relative minimum of fuss.  It is assumed that most programs
will have a (reasonably small) set of content-types they can handle
directly and will use this file to resolve others.

Of particular importance to me is the presence of MIME in the WWW
community, and the desirability of these two bodies of thought to try
to forge good things together rather than each do different and
incompatible things, as has happened in a few cases.

I believe both the mail-based MIME and WWW communities stand to
benefit from a unified content-type information file which is
somewhat, but not radically, richer than the present configuration.
I'd like to find some other people who are interested in doing this
and hammer out some issues.  I'm more interested in finding people who
are interested in extending the idea towards this kind of
functionality than in specific criticisms about the half-baked ideas
that follow, though those are fine too.

Some ideas include:

QUALITY VALUES.

HTTP includes the concept of quality values in content-type
negotiation so that, in principle, servers can be aware of the
specific dispositions of the hardware, software, and user preferences.
MIME attempts something similar through the multipart/alternative
structure, but the preference is strictly set by how the sender
chooses to order the body parts without regard for the specifics of
the viewing environment.

Adding something like an optional "quality" field to a mailcap entry
could provide this sort of information.  For example, consider the
following made-up mailcap excerpt:

  text/plain; cat; copiousoutput; quality=1.0
  application/postscript; ghostview %s; needsx11; quality=2.0
  application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput; quality=0.1

Clearly whether PostScript is to be preferred over plain text given
the above configuration is dependent upon whether X11 is currently
running.  More generally, what content-types are preferred is not
static.

Obviously, a WWW client could use the quality information in its
requests to reflect what form of information transfer is to be
preferred.  A normal MIME reader, however, could also use this
information to choose which portion of a multipart/alternative
structure to present, possibly overriding the default of presenting
the last body part possible.  This permits the specification of crude,
low-quality representations for complex objects for use in
impoverished environments without causing them to be preferred over
formats which can be directly displayed without loss.  Composing MIME
agents also might use this information (without the test conditions,
of course) to automatically order alternative body-parts.

FILE RECOGNITION

In general, when composing MIME entities, few people (or
non-interactive programs) sit down and decide "I think I'll insert an
image/jpeg and an application/postscript."  People are more likely to
think "I'll include this file I was working on which is named foo."

I have experimented with using the "nametemplate" field as a heuristic
for matching arbitrary filenames to content-types; I believe it
preferable to maintaining a separate configuration file mapping them
together.  However, that's not really ever what nametemplate was
intended to do.

It would be a big win to be able to define some (obviously
OS-dependent) mechanisms for specifying file attributes typical for
various content-types; all software that composes MIME entities, from
mail programs to HTTP servers, might use this.  

Consider the following made-up-off-the-top-of-my-head approach:

 application/postscript; blah; description=a PostScript(tm) file; \
  contenttest=ispostscript %s

Where the program "ispostscript" takes the filename of the prospective
body and returns with a zero exit status if that body is of type
application/postscript.  The test program might just look at the
filename, might check for magic numbers in the file, or whatever.

Here's another approach (actually two of them combined):

 text/plain; blah; matchfiles=*.txt
 application/postscript; blah; description=a PostScript(tm) file; \
  matchfiles=*.ps; magic=%!
 image/gif; blah; description=a GIF file; matchfiles=*.gif; magic=GIF
 audio/basic; blah; description=an 8-bit u-law mono 8000 Hz audio fragment; \
  matchfiles=*.snd,*.au; magic=.snd#000000010000000100001E40#

where the # delimits hexadecimal information.  Or something like that.

Along those general lines is the idea of providing additional
information to composing agents about making content-types.  For
instance, a field indicating what parameters are mandatory for this
content-type could be useful.

         *** ANNOUNCING THE BETA RELEASE OF NCSA httpd FOR WINDOWS ***

This is it, folks. Features are frozen. This version has many fixes
and enhancements, and most importantly of all...

             IT SUPPORTS UP TO 8 SIMULTANEOUS SESSIONS

But be forewarned. If you have a broken WinSock package, you won't be 
able to use the multi-threading. It is very demanding of the stability of 
the asynchronous server support features in the WinSock Spec. I have used 
these features to the max in order to provide fine-grain multi-threading 
so the server is as friendly to the Windows environment as possible.

A new command line switch, "-m" has been added. It should permit some 
WinSock packages with broken asynchronous closesocket() support to be 
able to handle multi-threading anyway. See the discussion below.

LOCATIONS:

   ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/rdenny/...

    to be mapped to a virtual directory tree as seen by the server.
* Includes NCSA "imagemap" support (DOS port), pre-configured
* Global and local document access controls
* If-Modified-Since support for caching proxy servers
* Access authentication using the "real" Unix crypt() for passwords
* Password file maintenance utility runs from DOS command line
* WinSock 1.1 compliant, uses recommended asynchronous API
* WinSock "fallback" mode for sub-standard WinSock packages (single-
    session only)
* Efficient cooperative multitasking, will not bog down your machine,
    or make clients wait on other clients' time-consuming transactions
* Common Log Format access log file, opened for shared read and flushed
    after each write

    authoring and administration references and primers.
* Includes Thomas Boutell's "wusage 3.0" statistics reporter (DOS port)
    pre-configured.
* WinCron utility included for weekly "wusage" runs and other periodic tasks.
* Demo pages (also useful for initial checkout and examples) that
    illustrate basic serving, ISINDEX, forms, image maps, password
    protection, and wusage
* Extensive built-in tracing facilities to help diagnose problems
* Icon animation, shows when (and how many) people are using your server

Unix httpd 1.1 major features not supported:

* PEM or PGP encryption
* Server-side includes

Unix httpd 1.3 major features not supported:
-------------------------------------------

* Enhanced icon mapping for automatic directory indexes
* CGI 1.1 enhancements
* Server-side include enhancements

Here is an excerpt from the release notes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2b2 is a beta-test update of NCSA httpd V1.2b1 for Microsoft 
Windows. It has been released as a replacement executable and these 
release notes only. The code is based on the Unix NCSA httpd Versions 1.1 
and 1.3 (hence the 1.2 -- in the middle) written by Rob McCool of NCSA. 
The Windows version was written by Bob Denny.

WinSock Bugs

Field tests have revealed weaknesses in some of the Windows Sockets 
packages that are in common use. My network I/O routines make use of 
features that were put into WinSock to permit concurrent transactions, 
and to minimize the impact of communications on the rest of the system. 
Also, httpd is a server, and therefore uses connection functions that are 
different from those used by client programs.

During the alpha test phase, I added workaround code to compensate for 
specific brands' WinSock weaknesses. This turned out to be a bad idea for 
several reasons. Instead, I have added two options to the server, which 
you can use to help isolate WinSock problems.

If you experience communication hangs, incomplete document deliveries, 
etc., try adding "-m" to the httpd command line. This causes socket 
closes to be performed in synchronous mode. The effect will be to reduce 
the efficiency of the server somewhat, but still permit multi-threading 
(assuming the rest of the WinSock package's async support is OK).

If you still have problems, your package is really broken. Add "-n" to 
the httpd command line. This disables multi-session support, disables all 
Windows efficiency optimizations, and reverts to simple blocking-mode 
operation. If this "cures" your problem, you need to gather evidence for 
submitting a bug report to your WinSock vendor.

Remove the "-n" and enable the network I/O tracing feature of httpd and 
look at the log. I will be glad to assist in interpretation. If it turns 
out to be a server bug, I'll fix it. If not, you'll have to live with 
single-session support and lower performance (with "-n turned on) until 
you can get your WinSock package fixed.

There are severe limitations with using COMMAND.COM as the shell for
executing scripts (see the  scripting docs). I am very interested to
hear from people who successfully get a real-world script to function in
a production environment. Also, I'd like to hear from people who are
using perl, icon, or Tcl.

Neither NCSA nor the authors are in a position to provide technical
support for this server. Direct your questions and problems to the
comp.infosystems.www USENET newsgroup. The authors do monitor this
newsgroup, as do many other people who may be able to help you with
questions and/or problems.

Server configuration and operation has been kept as similar as possible
to the Unix httpd.

Hi,

Quick question.

Its just come to my notice that the Cern HTTPD/cache decodes a URI, and then
re-encodes it before getting the document from the server in question.

Is this "safe" so to speak? It is causing a small, but no insignificant
change to a URI.

Paul

It should be safe. In my interpretation of the current URI spec,
it is safe, for example, if the client asks:

	GET http://www.hal.com/~connolly/index.html HTTP/1.0

since ~ is not a valid character in a URI, for the proxy to turn
around and ask the parent server:

	GET http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/index.html HTTP/1.0

Ah! Note: this is not "safe" for arbitrary URL's -- only for
URL schemes which are known to use the %XX syntax (all currently
defined URL schemes do: ftp:, http:, hmmmm... not sure about
gopher: -- the gopher folks seem to want to use their own syntax
for some things.) It is the consensus of the URI working group
(and NOT my opinion!) that new URL schemes are not bound to
use the %XX syntax, nore the significance of the /, ?, ;, =
characters.

It is also safe to change:

	GET http://www.hal.com/%7E%63onnolly/index.html HTTP/1.0
to
	GET http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/index.html HTTP/1.0

though it is NOT safe to mess with /, ?, ;, or = chars. e.g.
it's not cool to change:

	GET http://machost/volume/file%20with%2Fin%20it

to

	GET http://machost/volume/file%20with/in%20it

since this changes the meaning of the URL.


See the spec for details (sorry... I'm at a vt100 terminal, or
I'd give a machine-readable reference)

Hrm, okay, so in the future it should be okay. The cache in question was
a CERN one, no idea what version, that was translating '=' to %3D which
as Dan said is erm "NOT safe". That was the only thing I could see
causing problems (BTW from what I am told - not had a chance to check -
the BNF says that = should be escaped. Is that right?)

If Ari wants I can find out which version...

In some circumstances. Let me explain:

There are two purposes for the %XX construct:

	(1) distinguish data from markup, e.g.
	distinguish '/' as a pathname-consituent character
	(as it might be on a mac) from '/' as a pathname-separator
	character (as it in POSIX and the URI syntax).

	(2) allow transmission of URIs through transports that
	are only reliable for a subset of the 256 octets.

	I believe (2) was originally actually a hack to represent
	spaces in HREF attribute values, ala:
		HREF=ftp://machost/dir/file%20with%20spaces
	This is clearly bogus, since unquoted SGML attribute
	values have a much more limited syntax, and the simple
	way to represent the above is:
		HREF="ftp://machost/dir/file with spaces"
	What about URL's with " in them? SGML syntax includes:
		HREF="ftp://machost/dir/file with &#34; in it"
	So it is actually possible to represent an arbitrary
	sequence of characters in an SGML attribute value.

	But the (2) issue is still motivated by mail transport...

So ~ and %7E mean exactly the same thing. As long as the transport
is one in which ~ characters make it through OK, there's nothing
wrong with writing http://www.hal.com/~connolly/index.html, except
for the fact that some stupid implementation might copy that
into a mail message without changing the ~ to a %7E, and then
an ASCII/EBCDIC translation would munge the ~ char.

On the other hand, / and %7E do NOT mean the same thing. Nor
do = and %3D. %3D means "= as a data character", whereas plain = 
means, for example:
	ftp://host/dir/file;type=image


I hope that makes things clear.

By the way... these issues are the province of the URI working group,
whose discussion forum is the uri mailing list. Contact uri-request@bunyip.com.

Bad choice of words... Let me rephrase that... It's not like
WWW is bound by what the URI WG says.

They do talk about this stuff a lot though.

***************  May SIGWEB Meeting Announcement  ****************

The May SIGWEB meeting will be held at Sun Microsystems in Mountain View on
May 26th, from 2pm till 5pm.

The theme for the May meeting of the San Francisco Bay Area SIGWEB meeting
is the First Annual World Wide Web Conference (WWW94), held simultaneously
at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Agenda will be:

   - An introduction via telephone by an attendee of the Conference

   - A recording of the Keynote Address

     We'll attempt to record an MBONE transmission of the address, and will
     provide video if possible, but certainly audio.

   - A review of Web servers/services presented at the Conference

   - A conference call with Malcolm McAfee of Paideia on the Workshop
     "Teaching and Learning with the Web"

   - A review of the SIGWEB Survey (time and data permitting)

   - Breakout sessions (like the BOF's of last month's meeting)


Due to the distance and time delay, we may not be able to coordinate all
the events on the agenda.  Keep your fingers crossed.

Questions concerning this meeting may be directed toward 

 Jonny Goldman - meeting coordinator (jonny@synopsys.com, 415-694-1772) 
or
 Chris McRae - SIGWEB President, (mcrae@ora.com).

                -------------------------------------------------

SIGWEB May Meeting Time and Place

Date: Thursday, May 26
Time: 2:00 - 5:00 p.m.
Location:

	Sun Microsystems, Inc.

	Mountain View, CA

Directions to the meeting site:

        - Take 101 to San Antonio Rd exit North.

	- Make an immediate right on Bayshore Parkway

	- Make a first left on Garcia Ave

	- Finally, make a left onto the second drive and follow
	  the signs to building #6 (the 2nd bldg on the right.)

	The meeting will be held in a room directly off the main lobby.  
	A sign will direct you there.

               ---------------------------------------------------

SIGWEB is an organization started at the end of 1993 to facilitate
communication between practitioners of a field known generally as
Networked Information Delivery and Retrieval (NIDR) within the Bay
Area and surrounding region.  Started by Chris McRae (now at O'Reilly
& Associates - mcrae@ora.com), SIGWEB has quickly expanded to include
participation by several hundred people at its monthly events.  Past
events have included presentations by leaders in the development of
the World Wide Web and its client interfaces, Wide Area Information
Service (WAIS), Internet infrastructure, commercial applications of
the Internet (e.g. CommerceNet), and so on.  All aspects of NIDR, from
technical details and software applications, through standards and
end-user applications are open topics of discussion.  SIGWEB is an all
volunteer run group welcoming participation from all interested
individuals.

SIGWEB is based in the San Francisco Bay area, and meets once a month.

To join the SIGWEB electronic mail list, send a message to 
	sig-web-request@library.ucsf.edu

Can you Marc, or someone else, point me towards some sources of information

Subject: Statistics for Web Servers
content-length: 1318


I know that there are now millions of Internet users, however a large
proportion of these are using e-mail only. In order to establish a business
plan for a commercial WWW server in Ottawa I need to determine what sort of
traffic it might attract.

I am therefore interested in demographic information about WWW users or
statistics associated with specific servers. Any anecdotes, informed
opinions, advice or case studies will be very welcome. If you have
implemented a Web server yourself I would very much like to hear how
successful it has been and what sort of load it is carrying.

Another question is how many of these users have high-speed access as
opposed to dial up only? This will heavily influence the design of HTML
publications. As a Web server operator you may not know the answer to that
one.

I realise these are difficult questions but it is essential to answer them
to justify the cost of setting up a WWW server. If you have any information
that you can share with me or can point me at the appropriate sources it
will be very much appreciated. Please reply directly to this list, if
appropriate, or send me e-mail.

Thank you,
Mark.

Hi,

Is there some clever trick to display some text only when
the client doesn't support forms (So i can offer an alternative
link for accessing my data)?
Perhaps a clever CGI script?

Well, .zip archives presumably will be tagged as the content-type
application/zip (which is a registered content-type) or maybe
application/octet-stream.  Presumably any reasonable browser will
store the results in a file rather than, say, try to display them.
Though, who knows?  With a tar file, a user could well fire up emacs
and use its appropriate mode to browse the tar file.

In general, giving the recipient sufficient information to decide
whether the object should be viewed or just saved is probably better
than telling him what to do, though that may become more plausible
with Content-Disposition as it becomes defined.

True.

Ack!  If we're going to have lines that are only meaningful to Mosaic,
they should at least be tagged in some way so that other programs
using mailcaps won't try to use them, like maybe:

  video/quicktime; mosaic-internal-dump %s; x-mosaiconly; test=false

though it still is anything but clean and elegant...

>I *do* think that browsers should be able to save to a file after they
>download the data and "view" it.

Have to agree there.  Browsers also should provide a reasonably easy
way for users to download to a file directly without ever viewing it
if that's what they want.

Well, you can make a table of which User-Agent's have forms,
and then look at the HTTP User-Agent field. It's a hack, but
it works quite nicely. For example, ArchiePlex* generates
<IMG>'s with Mosaic's internal images only when the request
comes from Mosaic.

SYNTAX !!!

scheme://host/dir/dir/dir/file;atts  !!!!

NO NO NO NO NO  !!!!

It breaks on any system with version numbers. The semicolon is used on
most systems.

Even if you arn't lucky enough to have VMS there are still lots of systems 
that have version numbers, code management systems for example.

The scheme :-

scheme://host:port/dir/dir/dir/file//atts

Does work however and is backward compatible. Since a null directory is
never valid.

This scheme is very usefull when trying to URL a system with two variable
fields. A particular element within a database file for example.

So the FTP stuff becomes :-

ftp://host/dir/dir/dir/file//Content-Type=image/jpeg;Content-Language=Swedish

Subject: IRC URL
content-length: 1415


Hi folks,

I have an IRC link to the Web. the browser can connect to an IRC channel
and listen (will soon have send capability, come on guys what do you expect
for a three hour hack at 2am?)

So the question of the URL comes up. My first idea was:-

IRC:#WWW

to join the WWW channel, this soon became

IRC:%35WWW

After I realised that the anchor was a problem...


Then I thought that we should not make the mistakes of the news URL where
the field is not expandable. so instead of just assuming that the only
thing you can read is channel info :

IRC:JOIN/%35WWW
IRC:WHO/%35WWW

etc etc 

Then there is the problem of IRC servers, and the EFnet/Undernet divide.
IRC is about as stable and reliable as blammange. So it is essential
to be able to specify servers at random...

IRC://funet.fi/JOIN/%35WWW

But the problem then is of the referentiality of the link we want the user 
to go to their `best' server even though theu may have many. What I 
did instead was to use logical names EFNET and UNDERNET, and use the urls 
as follows:

$EFNET:/JOIN/%35WWW
EFNET = IRC://funet.fi/

The $EFNET is resolved by resolving the logical name (symbol or whatever)
to get the Root URL then doing the standard relativity calculations
(logical, not Lorentz!)...


Comment from the IRC link when I tried this out

`you want to connect IRC to the Web? You're mad'

Doesn't matter.  Semicolon is a reserved character in the URL grammar; if you
want it to represent itself in a filename you need to escape it.

Subject: Clickable Image  Support!!
content-length: 894

Hi everybody!!
I have a problem setting up my server to support Clickable Images.
The configuration seems to be correct, but I got always an error when  
I click on the image:
can't access file:  
file://localhost/htbin/htimage/ReDS/www/www-data/Img/pepsi.conf?228%2C 
102.
Well the path is correct, so what to do?
Where to find a tutorial on Clickable Image  Support, or it's so easy  
I don't need it?
I already have the CERN http Guide, well it seems so easy that I feel  
very stupid!!! :o(

Thank you for any suggestion !

Gianfranco

WWW Birds of A Feather @ IEEE MM'94 Conference

Minutes of meeting:

I. Attendance
	
	About 12 people attended. Two from Bell Labs, One from Sandia,
	two from MIT, GTE,  and a few others.

II. Topics

a. Hierachical caching, multi-part MIME messages

	briefly discussed as a good thing.

b. Continous (as apposed to stateless HTTP)

	A general consensus for need, but a feeling that it should
	not be part of the HTTP protocol

c. Multi-Threaded WWW clients

	Sure. When can we get them?

d. Embedded audio, movies, and other viewers

	Considered part of a new WWW client archicteture

e. New client architecture
	
	General consensus that one large "do-everything" client
 	is an outdated concept. Clients should be composed out
	of a hetergenous mix of pieces - all cooperating to produce
	one logical WWW client.

	However, there was much to still be resolved as to how these
	pieces communicate. Some were inclined to extend HTTP, so
	want a new protocol. I am partial to shared distributed memories
	along the tuple-space model of Linda, etc. 

f. Security

	lots of concern about the cost of firewalls (e.g. at Bell Labs).
	and also lots of concern about new protocols for continuous
	interaction, and the holes they might open up. 

	Basically, we face competing needs (1) to open up the protocol
	to allow more live embedded and interactive apps to work in
	conjuction with the client (2) the need for restricited protocols
	that can be verified for rigor and security.

g. WWW resource discovery

	Some interesting comments about librarians and their ability
	to master the task of locating information in one knowledge domain
	scattered among many sources. 

	Also some interesting sociological discussions about the potential
	jobs security and career opportunites for those who can master
	where to find things on the Web!

	Definite interest in URN type mechanisms that detatch physical
	name from logical name. 

h. Jobs
	
	seems that MIT students are in hot demand this year as summer
	interns to produce HTML pages for companies! Students get the
	opportunity to "learn about networks" and companies get nice
	looking pages.

An interesting concept was brought up at the recent WWW BOF
at IEEE ICMCS.

Languages such as SGML and HTML  describe document structure.
By design, style and rendering issues are left to the individual
viewer. 

However, many people would like to have more control over the
actual rendering of the document (alignment, font size, tabbing,
highlight color, etc, etc.)

How about an HTML style sheet attachment? 

That is, an author would create both an HTML document and a link
to an attached style sheet. Rendering and style data would
be placed on this sheet. 

WWW clients could either 

a) ignore this link
b) strictly follow the style attachment
c) use the style attachment as a default and allow the end
   user to have local overides for style attributes.

(I suggest C!)

I fully support this concept.  One of the drawbacks publishers (I mean
"real" publishers) see with WWW/HTML is their lack of ability to
provide editorial guidnace for their publication.  A style sheet is a
step in the right direction.  

Can this concept be incorporated in HTML+ ?

Hi Webers!
Sorry if my questions are fool...I am just a novice in the W3 world.
I put my server and browsers to do the job OK, all the thing works fine
but a have installed a variant of CSO PH (just to put rules e others
pretty things on the browser output). I use phf.c thats came with
ncsa_htpd...The only problem is that when I try put a inline image:

<IMG SRC="images/anygif.gif"> ...this generate a message:

Error Accessing Server
No conversion between document types....

In the beginning of phf.c output I have the MIME line: 

Content-type: text/html that I think that is the source of problems... I
have tried to change it by Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary...etc but
this do not work at all...

Any ideas?

Subject: How do you execute shell scripts in Mosaic......????????
content-length: 705

Hello,

	Has anyone managed to execute a shell script from a hypertext link in 
a html style document within mosaic. I understand it is possible, from the notes
I have seen on this matter I have changed the following files:

	added the following to the .mailcap file
application/x-csh; csh -f %s

	the following is included in the mime.types file
application/x-csh	csh

I have made the above changes and it does not work. I have the added constraint 
in that I am not using a http server, our network is strictly internal.
When you want to execute a shell script do you use a normal hypertext link, ie
use the href="filename" command?

Any advice would be most welcome.

Then I guess the server will have to translate it to a local filename,
just like everyone else.  The URL space has nothing to do with your local
filename space.

No, this will not work.  / is a reserved character.  You cannot depend

If it's never valid then why would you propose using it?

<sigh> Yes, stylesheets are VERY VERY important to the future of the web 
for publishing.  Tools like Mosaic are only really useful to the 
end-user.  They support few of the requirements a publisher looks for in a 
publishing platform.

Having talked to many, many publishers, I can tell you that they are 
excited about tools like Mosaic until they resize the window -- thus 
completely reformatting the document -- or until I show them how trivial it 
is for the consumer to change the font.

Publishing, like many things,  is the exercise of control over chaos --  

	editorial control over the chaos of the creator, 

	distribution control over the chaos of the marketplace and 

	presentational control over the chaos of the medium.

Presenting tools which rob the publisher of one third of their purpose is 
no way to develop new media or build confidence in this new technology.

See:

http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/.www-talk-1993q2.messages/443.html

...for a full stylesheet specification for HTML.

Hello,

Part of the reason that the number of html documents has ballooned
so much is that they are so simple to format.  By restricting
and/or complicating the formatting, you vastly reduce the number of
people who are willing to learn the system and use it.  The World
Wide Web was designed to expand communication globally.  Don't
fuss that up by adding a bunch of fluff.  There's a well known
concept in business that works.  It's called K.I.S.S.  -  Keep
It Simple Stupid!

Not in the Windows httpd, but... that's a COOL idea, and it would be really
easy to implement.

  <sigh> Yes, stylesheets are VERY VERY important to the future of the web 
  for publishing.  Tools like Mosaic are only really useful to the 
  end-user.  They support few of the requirements a publisher looks for in a 
  publishing platform.
  
  Having talked to many, many publishers, I can tell you that they are 
  excited about tools like Mosaic until they resize the window -- thus 
  completely reformatting the document -- or until I show them how trivial it 
  is for the consumer to change the font.
  
I am visually handicapped.  One of the things that makes my life a little more 
difficult is publishers' fondness for making things a little prettier by doing 
things like printing grey text on slightly lighter grey backgrounds (I find 
much of what's printed in Wired illegible, for example).  One of the ways that 
WWW viewers make my life easier is exactly by allowing me to play with fonts 
and colors so I can read more comfortably.

Stop talking to publishers.  Talk to readers.  Tell the publishers what the 
readers said.

Hear! Hear!!

On the other hand, simple formatting (i.e., justification) makes sense.
Going to the level of fonts, would imply that a 1 kbyte HTML file would 
balloon to something like a 100 kbyte postscript file. And then there's 
color...........

If someone really, really feels the creative need to totally control fonts, 
layout, color, etc. - create graphics files, not HTMLs.

Simon,

Are you asking about how to execute a script on the client side that
comes in from an arbitrary hypertext link?  If so, there's a potential
security issue.  There's essentially no limit on what damage the
script can do.

The proposal I mentioned in my previous posting adds one optional element 
to the existant <LINK> tag in html.  It does not complicate  HTML other 
than that.

The issue you raise is an important one which is why we have always 
strived to promote optional elements to the existing core "standard" 
rather than unnecessarily complicating it.

Much of the web is there because it is simple (comparitively) to learn 
HTML and to format documents.  Much more of the web is possible if we can 
add extra functionality which does not obscure HTML's simplicity.

Subject: Suggestion: URL string-search syntax
Cc: torrance@pompeii.east.sun.com
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
content-length: 2799

I have a suggestion for an addition to the #key syntax currently used
to enable a URL to refer to a labelled anchor within a document.

The suggestion is to extend this syntax to support reference to an
arbitrary text string contained within the referenced document.  As
with present #key URLs, this search would be done by the client after
the document is retrieved, and the # and whatever follows it would not
be sent to the server as part of the URL.

My suggestion is that #! be reserved as the header for a string to
be searched for in this fashion.  So <http://www.ai.mit.edu#!finance> would
retrieve the URL <http://www.ai.mit.edu> and then search for the first
occurrence of finance.  If it is found (case sensitive), the browser would
display that portion of the document (and probably hilight the string, or
otherwise indicate where it is).  If not found, I suggest just going to the
top of the retrieved document with nothing hilighted.  I also suggest
allowing spaces in the search string; this works at present in NCSA X Mosaic.
Should they be escaped?  Should we use a different syntax in the URL for this?

I have implemented this functionality by making small changes to NCSA X Mosaic.
If someone from NCSA would like to consider adding these changes, write me and
I will send them to you.

Reasons for this change:
I would like to be able to refer to parts of a document that was not
structured to facilitate such reference; for example, a document of which I
am not the author.  Eventually, I would like to see byte-offset ranges
available as a way to refer to parts of other documents as well.

This will support annotations which refer to specific parts of a source
document.  Smart browsers may be able to indicate the presence of these
annotations with marginal notes or changebars next to the sections to which
they refer.

There may be concern that the URL will break if the document is changed.
This is a concern already with references to internal named anchors.
One possible solution would be some sort of short identifier, automatically
computed by a browser/poster at the time a user is making an annotation,
which is unlikely to match anything but the original section, and which
may be designed to match that section even if it changes slightly.  We are
currently working on the design of such an identifier; suggestions are
welcome.

After looking over the current spec and picking apart the unstated but
possibly implied differences between HREF and URN, I have a question:

CAN <A URN="value"> mean retrieve the page that has this Uniform Resource
Name once it has been resolved into a URL?

Currently the spec says that the URN attribute only has value when in
conjunction with an HREF.

Is this the intended meaning and if so can that intended meaning be changed
in order to accomodate URN->URL resolution?

Over the course of trying to figure out how to more effectively handle
MIME information within the context of WWW, I discovered just how
depressingly far apart these two worlds are.

Consider the following HTTP response:

 HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
 MIME-version: 1.0
 Content-type: text/plain
 
 This is text in us-ascii; just testing.

Perfectly reasonable.  Now, suppose we tweak it ever so slightly:

 HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
 MIME-version: 1.0
 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
 
 This is text in us-ascii; just testing.

It works in exactly the same way, right?  After all, the default
charset of text/plain must be either US-ASCII (the MIME default) or a
superset of it (ISO-Latin-1, I guess.)  Section 2.4.4 of the HTTP spec
explicitly permits, even encourages, use of standard MIME parameters
to further specify the content-type.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way...

- Mosaic for UNIX:  Does not display, but instead prompts the user to
  save in a file as an unrecognized content-type
- Lynx:  prompts the user to save in a file
- WWW Line Mode Browser:  prompts to save in file
- TkWWW:  Gives some funky error about a missing parameter and stays
  on the current page
- Mosaic for Mac:  Does the right thing!

If anyone wants to test this on their browser, the URL for the test
document I used is http://www.cs.indiana.edu/test.params and should
still be there.  Varying things like the case of US-ASCII did not
appear to make a difference, although it's supposed to be
case-insensitive anyway.

It appears as though either:

- I am misreading the spec, and parameters specifying the character
  set should not be used for text/plain objects
- Most of the existing browsers are broken; servers don't generate
  parameters, so browsers don't bother to handle them properly even
  though they're in the spec

So, which is it?  And what do we do about it?

easier viewing) Of course they can; I do it alot for contrast (for example). 
It's a little harder for inline graphics, of course.

I seem to remember this discussion going round and round back at the 
WWWWW in July, and I don't think I've seen anything new this time around.

>From what I recall, the general concensus was that there was no concensus 
but the architecture that caused the least amount of chair throwing
was that if people were going to add support for style sheets, it should be 
via some LINK and processing instructions, not via intrusive modification to
the DTD (or at least nothing more than a <stysheet> tag.

I'm sure if somebody does a reference implementation and it doesn't suck too
badly, it'll get adopted...

Please note that my suggestion for the implementation of stylesheets in 
WWW in no way dicates what the user MUST see.  Stylesheets, to be 
effective, need to be a collection of HINTS or SUGGESTIONS regarding the 
visual presentation of information.

Ahhh, but we are entirely redefining publishing.  You tell Simon-Schuster 
and Paramount that they need to drop everything and start living on-line.

Subject: Media type registration in HTTP
Date: Tue, 24 May 1994 23:33:19 -0500
Message-Id: <26610.769840399@hound.cs.indiana.edu>
Sender: mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu
content-length: 3119

The current hypertext version of the HTTP spec, as well as the
(expired) Internet-Draft, reads as follows with regard to the
registration of content-types:

#  EXTRA NON-MIME TYPES
#
#   It is reasonable to put strict limits on transfer formats for mail,
#   where there is no guarantee that the receiver will understand a weird
#   format. However, in HTTP one knows that the receiver will be able to
#   receive it because it will have been sent in the Accept: field. There
#   is therefore a lot to be gained from a very complete registry of
#   well-defined types for HTTP which may nevertheless not be recommended
#   for mail. In this case, the content-type list for HTTP may be a
#   superset of the MIME list.

It seems to me this paragraph can be eliminated entirely, along with
the concept of a separate registry for HTTP types, in light of the
generalization of media type registration procedures detailed in RFC
1590.

The current document suggests an HTTP registration authority for
content-types; obviously there needs to be some kind of agreement on
what application/foo means so that people can effectively exchange
many types of information with confidence.  No registration procedure
is defined, however, for how this authority would accept and maintain
this information.  I suggest that, if we were to sit down and and
attempt to write such a specification, the results would bear a
striking resemblance to 1590.

Quoting from that document provides precisely the reason why the
concerns expressed about the strict limits on content type
registration no longer apply and establishing a separate authority
would be a Bad Thing:

#3.1 MIME Requirements for a Limited Number of Content-Types
#
#   Issue:  In the asynchronous mail environment, where information on
#   the capabilities of the remote mail agent is not available to the
#   sender, maximum interoperability is attained by restricting the
#   number of content-types used to those "common" content-types expected
#   to be widely implemented.  This was asserted as a reason to limit the
#   number of possible content-types and resulted in a registration
#   process with a significant hurdle and delay for those registering
#   content-types.
#
#   Comment:  The need for "common" content-types formats does not
#   require limiting the registration of new content-types.  This
#   restriction may, in fact, hinder interoperability by causing separate
#   registration authorities for specific applications which may register
#   values in conflict with or otherwise incompatible with each other.
#   If a limited set of content-types recommended for a particular
#   application, that should be asserted by a separate applicability
#   statement specific for the application and/or environment.

Anyway, I'd like to see the proposed HTTP content registration folded
into the existing one (for that matter, I wish content encoding could
also be folded into the existing structure, but that's a little
harder) and a note that HTTP exchanges "media types."

I'd say myself that you are in the right and most of the browsers are
broken.  The only thing to do about it is to send in bug reports to the
various browser writers and then, after they've had some time to
assimilate the bug fix into a new release, start deploying servers that
follow the spec as well.  This is the only way forward that I can see if
HTTP is going to start using kosher MIME as I think it should.

Subject: Metered Usage of the Internet: JSN

Please forgive the mass mailing, but I feel this is a subject which is
of great importance to anyone who benefits from the bountiful resources
of the Internet.

A very bad storm is brooding on the horizon.  In the future, you might
have to pay a charge for every E-mail message you send or receive,
every Usenet article you read, every kilobyte of data you transfer with
ftp, every hypertext link you follow with NCSA Mosaic or Gopher...

Hopefully this frightens you as much as it does me.  But it will
happen, unless YOU do something about it.

Please read the attached, fill out the requested info, and mail it back
to mike@essential.org.  It also wouldn't hurt to forward a copy of this
to everyone you know on the Internet.

Thanks for your support.

TAXPAYER ASSETS PROJECT - INFORMATION POLICY NOTE
May 7, 1994

- -    Request for signatures for a letter to NSF opposing metered
pricing of Internet usage

- -    Please repost this request freely

The letter will be sent to Steve Wolff, the Director of
Networking and Communications for NSF.  The purpose of the letter
is to express a number of user concerns about the future of
Internet pricing.  NSF recently announced that is awarding five
key contracts to telephone companies to operate four Internet
"Network Access Points" (NAPs), and an NSF funded very high speed
backbone (vBNS).  There have been a number of indications that
the telephone companies operating the NAPs will seek permission
from NSF to price NAPs services according to some measure of
Internet usage.  The vBNS is expected to act as a testbed for new
Internet pricing and accounting schemes.  The letter expresses
the view that metered pricing of Internet usage should be
avoided, and that NSF should ensure that the free flow of
information through Internet listserves and file server sites is
preserved and enhanced.

Jamie Love, Taxpayer Assets Project (love@essential.org; but
unable to answer mail until May 15).  Until then, direct
inquires to Michael Ward.

If you are willing to sign the letter, send the following
information to Mike Ward of the Taxpayer Assets Project
(mike@essential.org, fax: 202/234-5176; voice: 202/387-8030;

The letter follows:

Steve Wolff
Director
Division of Networking and Communications
National Science Foundation
1800 G Street
Washington, DC  20550

Dear Steve:

It is our understanding that the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and other federal agencies are developing a new
architecture for the Internet that will utilize four new Network
Access Points (NAPs), which have been described as the new
"cloverleaves" for the Internet.  You have indicated that NSF is
awarding contracts for four NAPs, which will be operated by
telephone companies (Pac Bell, S.F.; Ameritech, Chicago; Sprint,
NY; and MFS, Washington, DC).  We further understand that NSF has
selected MCI to operate its new very high speed backbone (vBNS)
facility.

There is broad public interest in the outcome of the negotiations
between NSF and the companies that will operate the NAPs and
vBNS.  We are writing to ask that NSF consider the following
objectives in its negotiations with these five firms:

PRICING.

We are concerned about the future pricing systems for Internet
access and usage.  Many users pay fixed rates for Internet
connections, often based upon the bandwidth of the connection,
and do not pay for network usage, such as the transfer of data
using email, ftp, Gopher or Mosaic.  It has been widely reported
on certain Internet discussion groups, such as com-priv, that the
operators of the NAPs are contemplating a system of usage based
pricing.

We are very concerned about any movement toward usage based
pricing on the Internet, and we are particularly concerned about
the future of the Internet Listserves, which allow broad
democratic discourse on a wide range of issues.  We believe that
the continued existence and enhancement of the Internet
discussion groups and distribution lists is so important that any
pricing scheme for the NAPs that would endanger or restrict their
use should be rejected by the NSF.

It is important for NSF to recognize that the Internet is more
than a network for scientific researchers or commercial
transactions.  It represents the most important new effort to
expand democracy into a wide range of human endeavors.  The open
communication and the free flow of information have make
government and private organizations more accountable, and
allowed citizens to organize and debate the widest range of
matters.  Federal policy should be directed at expanding public
access to the Internet, and it should reject efforts to introduce
pricing schemes for Internet usage that would mimic commercial
telephone networks or expensive private network services such as
MCI mail.

To put this into perspective, NSF officials must consider how any
pricing mechanisms will change the economics of hosting an
Internet electronic mail discussion groups and distribution
lists.  Many of these discussion groups and lists are very large,
such as Humanist, GIS-L, CNI-Copyright, PACS-L, CPSR-Announce or
Com-Priv.  It is not unusual for a popular Internet discussion
group to have several thousand members, and send out more than
100,000 email messages per day.  These discussion groups and
distribution lists are the backbones of democratic discourse on
the Internet, and it is doubtful that they would survive if
metered pricing of electronic mail is introduced on the Internet.

Usage based pricing would also introduce a wide range of problems
regarding the use of ftp, gopher and mosaic servers, since it
conceivable that the persons who provide "free" information on
servers would be asked to pay the costs of "sending" data to
persons who request data.  This would vastly increase the costs
of operating a server site, and would likely eliminate many
sources of data now "published" for free.

We are also concerned about the types of  accounting mechanisms
which may be developed or deployed to facilitate usage based
pricing schemes., which raise a number of concerns about personal
privacy.  Few Internet users are anxious to see a new system of
"surveillance" that will allow the government or private data
vendors to monitor and track individual usage of Information
obtained from Internet listserves or fileserves.

ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES

We are also concerned about the potential for anti-
competitive behavior by the firms that operate the NAPs.  Since
1991 there have been a number of criticisms of ANS pricing
practices, and concerns about issues such as price discrimination
or preferential treatment are likely to become more important as
the firms operating the NAPs become competitors of firms that
must connect to the NAPs.  We are particularly concerned about
the announcements by PAC-Bell and Ameritech that they will enter
the retail market for Internet services, since both firms were
selected by NSF to operate NAPs.  It is essential that the
contracts signed by NSF include the strongest possible measures
to insure that the operators of the NAPs do not unfairly
discriminate against unaffiliated companies.

Recommendations:

As the Internet moves from the realm of the research community to
a more vital part of the nation's information infrastructure, the
NSF must ensure that its decisions reflect the needs and values
of a much larger community.

1.   The NSF contracts with the NAPs operators will include
clauses that determine how the NAP services will be priced.
It is important that NSF disclose and receive comment on all
pricing proposals before they become final.  NSF should
create an online discussion list to facilitate public dialog
on the pricing proposals, and NSF should identify its
criteria for selecting a particular pricing mechanism,
addressing the issue of how the pricing system will impact
the Internet's role in facilitating democratic debate.

2.   NSF should create a consumer advisory board which would
include a broad cross section of consumer interests,
including independent network service providers (NSPs),
publishers of Internet discussion groups and distribution
lists, academic networks, librarians, citizen groups and
individual users.  This advisory board should review a
number of policy questions related to the operation of the
Internet, including questions such as the NAP pricing, NAP
operator disclosure of financial, technical and operational
data, systems of Internet accounting which are being tested
on the vBNS and other topics.

3.   NSF should solicit public comment, though an online
discussion group, of the types of safeguards against
anticompetitive behavior by the NAPs which should be
addressed in the NSF/NAPs contracts, and on issues such as
NAPs pricing and Internet accounting systems.

Given how new the web is, and how wet the ink on the specification is,
don't be surprised that the browsers don't conform to the
specification. Usually, network protocol standards take years to shake
out. That the web has grown as quickly as it has is phenomenal;
however, I don't think we can avoid a year or two of shakeout (if not
more) as the specs get re-written, browsers and libraries get brought
into conformance, etc.

True, but it's not clear to me how readily it can be said that this
really applies here.  The MIME spec for content-types hit RFC stage
(which HTTP, HTML, and URLs have not yet done) in June 1992 and is
progressing along the standards track nicely; syntax has been
unchanged since then.  The idea of content-types was originally
proposed in RFC 1049, in which they too were fields delimited by
semicolons, in March 1988.  This isn't some new, wild concept that
just popped up; it's one of the most stable aspects of the spec for
WWW stuff.  We've had our year or two.

The root is that there's no good way to generate parameter information
given the current structure of most servers (e.g. how can a server
look at a given file and determine what its charset is?)  Thus, few
servers produce documents with parameters, so clients that are
developed exclusively by testing with existing servers without
consulting the specs don't notice anything wrong.  That's probably OK
in the early stages, but we're getting to the point where people
should be able to expect things to work the way it says they will.
Alas, this is in direct conflict with the prevailing idea that we
should build a taller skyscraper yesterday, and worry about pouring
the foundation later on.

I am releasing the sources for diswww, a stand-alone gateway that
enables WWW users to access Discuss, a network electronic conferencing
system written at MIT.

I installed a copy of the gateway on
    http://www.mit.edu:8008/

The sources are available by anonymous FTP from
    ftp://sipb.mit.edu/pub/diswww/diswww.tar.gz
Note that this site currently also serves the RTFM.MIT.EDU FAQ
archives, so you might run into the annoying "Maximum number of users
exceeded" message...

I also created a mailing list for announcements and discussion of
diswww porting and development.  It's intended to be fairly
low-volume. The list name is diswww@mit.edu, and requests for
addition/deletion should be sent to diswww-request@mit.edu.

If you want more information about the gateway, send me mail.

PS.  The sources require that you have Discuss installed on your
     system.  Just in case you are interested, the sources for Discuss
     and some limited documentation are available by anonymous FTP
     from ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu/pub/ATHENA/discuss/discuss1.6.tar.Z

Yes.  It goes against the intended use of URLs because it implies that the
returned directory will have filenames that are meaningful to the user.
But maybe that type of URL should be valid. I'd return titles, not the
directory list.

I have huge directories of files with filenames that are utterly
meaningless to the user (news items, hierarchical menus, people and company
profiles, etc.).  I'd hate to allow users to waste server time grabbing
huge meaningless directories.  I'm totally against any proposal that would
require filenames to be meaningful to the user, or even the client, for
that matter.  They need to optimized for the server and whatever software
creates and maintains them.

I'm generating tons of files and filenames automatically.  Twice I tried to
use meaningful file names (partly because AppleSearch, which I'm using,
returns filenames), but the complexities of automating that process are
nasty, especially when you're designing for the least common denominator
O/S -- DOS, with 8 chars and an extension, or even worse, CompuServe, with
six chars and an extension!  Further, the HTTP spec rather clearly says
that URLs aren't meant to be interpreted by users.

Here's an alternative idea -- instead of returning a directory in response
to a URL like that, return a list of document <title>s as HREFs!  Hmm, I
like that one...  It would save the server from having to respond to a
series of HEAD instructions from a robot, among other things.  Adding file
sizes might be nice, too.

My apologies to those who are also on Web4Lib who heard the same rants from
me yesterday... but at least I've come up with one good idea (I think)
since then.

Forgive me, but what's to prevent browser clients from being able to read 
.ps files; can http not point to a postscript file as it would any other 
non html file, and thus provide a gateway? Wouldn't this solve the 
publishers' problem, and keep HTML simpler?

Subject: Metered Usage of the Internet: JSN

Please forgive the mass mailing, but I feel this is a subject which is
of great importance to anyone who benefits from the bountiful resources
of the Internet.

A very bad storm is brooding on the horizon.  In the future, you might
have to pay a charge for every E-mail message you send or receive,
every Usenet article you read, every kilobyte of data you transfer with
ftp, every hypertext link you follow with NCSA Mosaic or Gopher...

Hopefully this frightens you as much as it does me.  But it will
happen, unless YOU do something about it.

Please read the attached, fill out the requested info, and mail it back
to mike@essential.org.  It also wouldn't hurt to forward a copy of this
to everyone you know on the Internet.

Thanks for your support.

TAXPAYER ASSETS PROJECT - INFORMATION POLICY NOTE
May 7, 1994

- -    Request for signatures for a letter to NSF opposing metered
pricing of Internet usage

- -    Please repost this request freely

The letter will be sent to Steve Wolff, the Director of
Networking and Communications for NSF.  The purpose of the letter
is to express a number of user concerns about the future of
Internet pricing.  NSF recently announced that is awarding five
key contracts to telephone companies to operate four Internet
"Network Access Points" (NAPs), and an NSF funded very high speed
backbone (vBNS).  There have been a number of indications that
the telephone companies operating the NAPs will seek permission
from NSF to price NAPs services according to some measure of
Internet usage.  The vBNS is expected to act as a testbed for new
Internet pricing and accounting schemes.  The letter expresses
the view that metered pricing of Internet usage should be
avoided, and that NSF should ensure that the free flow of
information through Internet listserves and file server sites is
preserved and enhanced.

Jamie Love, Taxpayer Assets Project (love@essential.org; but
unable to answer mail until May 15).  Until then, direct
inquires to Michael Ward.

If you are willing to sign the letter, send the following
information to Mike Ward of the Taxpayer Assets Project
(mike@essential.org, fax: 202/234-5176; voice: 202/387-8030;

The letter follows:

Steve Wolff
Director
Division of Networking and Communications
National Science Foundation
1800 G Street
Washington, DC  20550

Dear Steve:

It is our understanding that the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and other federal agencies are developing a new
architecture for the Internet that will utilize four new Network
Access Points (NAPs), which have been described as the new
"cloverleaves" for the Internet.  You have indicated that NSF is
awarding contracts for four NAPs, which will be operated by
telephone companies (Pac Bell, S.F.; Ameritech, Chicago; Sprint,
NY; and MFS, Washington, DC).  We further understand that NSF has
selected MCI to operate its new very high speed backbone (vBNS)
facility.

There is broad public interest in the outcome of the negotiations
between NSF and the companies that will operate the NAPs and
vBNS.  We are writing to ask that NSF consider the following
objectives in its negotiations with these five firms:

PRICING.

We are concerned about the future pricing systems for Internet
access and usage.  Many users pay fixed rates for Internet
connections, often based upon the bandwidth of the connection,
and do not pay for network usage, such as the transfer of data
using email, ftp, Gopher or Mosaic.  It has been widely reported
on certain Internet discussion groups, such as com-priv, that the
operators of the NAPs are contemplating a system of usage based
pricing.

We are very concerned about any movement toward usage based
pricing on the Internet, and we are particularly concerned about
the future of the Internet Listserves, which allow broad
democratic discourse on a wide range of issues.  We believe that
the continued existence and enhancement of the Internet
discussion groups and distribution lists is so important that any
pricing scheme for the NAPs that would endanger or restrict their
use should be rejected by the NSF.

It is important for NSF to recognize that the Internet is more
than a network for scientific researchers or commercial
transactions.  It represents the most important new effort to
expand democracy into a wide range of human endeavors.  The open
communication and the free flow of information have make
government and private organizations more accountable, and
allowed citizens to organize and debate the widest range of
matters.  Federal policy should be directed at expanding public
access to the Internet, and it should reject efforts to introduce
pricing schemes for Internet usage that would mimic commercial
telephone networks or expensive private network services such as
MCI mail.

To put this into perspective, NSF officials must consider how any
pricing mechanisms will change the economics of hosting an
Internet electronic mail discussion groups and distribution
lists.  Many of these discussion groups and lists are very large,
such as Humanist, GIS-L, CNI-Copyright, PACS-L, CPSR-Announce or
Com-Priv.  It is not unusual for a popular Internet discussion
group to have several thousand members, and send out more than
100,000 email messages per day.  These discussion groups and
distribution lists are the backbones of democratic discourse on
the Internet, and it is doubtful that they would survive if
metered pricing of electronic mail is introduced on the Internet.

Usage based pricing would also introduce a wide range of problems
regarding the use of ftp, gopher and mosaic servers, since it
conceivable that the persons who provide "free" information on
servers would be asked to pay the costs of "sending" data to
persons who request data.  This would vastly increase the costs
of operating a server site, and would likely eliminate many
sources of data now "published" for free.

We are also concerned about the types of  accounting mechanisms
which may be developed or deployed to facilitate usage based
pricing schemes., which raise a number of concerns about personal
privacy.  Few Internet users are anxious to see a new system of
"surveillance" that will allow the government or private data
vendors to monitor and track individual usage of Information
obtained from Internet listserves or fileserves.

ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES

We are also concerned about the potential for anti-
competitive behavior by the firms that operate the NAPs.  Since
1991 there have been a number of criticisms of ANS pricing
practices, and concerns about issues such as price discrimination
or preferential treatment are likely to become more important as
the firms operating the NAPs become competitors of firms that
must connect to the NAPs.  We are particularly concerned about
the announcements by PAC-Bell and Ameritech that they will enter
the retail market for Internet services, since both firms were
selected by NSF to operate NAPs.  It is essential that the
contracts signed by NSF include the strongest possible measures
to insure that the operators of the NAPs do not unfairly
discriminate against unaffiliated companies.

Recommendations:

As the Internet moves from the realm of the research community to
a more vital part of the nation's information infrastructure, the
NSF must ensure that its decisions reflect the needs and values
of a much larger community.

1.   The NSF contracts with the NAPs operators will include
clauses that determine how the NAP services will be priced.
It is important that NSF disclose and receive comment on all
pricing proposals before they become final.  NSF should
create an online discussion list to facilitate public dialog
on the pricing proposals, and NSF should identify its
criteria for selecting a particular pricing mechanism,
addressing the issue of how the pricing system will impact
the Internet's role in facilitating democratic debate.

2.   NSF should create a consumer advisory board which would
include a broad cross section of consumer interests,
including independent network service providers (NSPs),
publishers of Internet discussion groups and distribution
lists, academic networks, librarians, citizen groups and
individual users.  This advisory board should review a
number of policy questions related to the operation of the
Internet, including questions such as the NAP pricing, NAP
operator disclosure of financial, technical and operational
data, systems of Internet accounting which are being tested
on the vBNS and other topics.

3.   NSF should solicit public comment, though an online
discussion group, of the types of safeguards against
anticompetitive behavior by the NAPs which should be
addressed in the NSF/NAPs contracts, and on issues such as
NAPs pricing and Internet accounting systems.

Given how new the web is, and how wet the ink on the specification is,
don't be surprised that the browsers don't conform to the
specification. Usually, network protocol standards take years to shake
out. That the web has grown as quickly as it has is phenomenal;
however, I don't think we can avoid a year or two of shakeout (if not
more) as the specs get re-written, browsers and libraries get brought
into conformance, etc.

True, but it's not clear to me how readily it can be said that this
really applies here.  The MIME spec for content-types hit RFC stage
(which HTTP, HTML, and URLs have not yet done) in June 1992 and is
progressing along the standards track nicely; syntax has been
unchanged since then.  The idea of content-types was originally
proposed in RFC 1049, in which they too were fields delimited by
semicolons, in March 1988.  This isn't some new, wild concept that
just popped up; it's one of the most stable aspects of the spec for
WWW stuff.  We've had our year or two.

The root is that there's no good way to generate parameter information
given the current structure of most servers (e.g. how can a server
look at a given file and determine what its charset is?)  Thus, few
servers produce documents with parameters, so clients that are
developed exclusively by testing with existing servers without
consulting the specs don't notice anything wrong.  That's probably OK
in the early stages, but we're getting to the point where people
should be able to expect things to work the way it says they will.
Alas, this is in direct conflict with the prevailing idea that we
should build a taller skyscraper yesterday, and worry about pouring
the foundation later on.

I am releasing the sources for diswww, a stand-alone gateway that
enables WWW users to access Discuss, a network electronic conferencing
system written at MIT.

I installed a copy of the gateway on
    http://www.mit.edu:8008/

The sources are available by anonymous FTP from
    ftp://sipb.mit.edu/pub/diswww/diswww.tar.gz
Note that this site currently also serves the RTFM.MIT.EDU FAQ
archives, so you might run into the annoying "Maximum number of users
exceeded" message...

I also created a mailing list for announcements and discussion of
diswww porting and development.  It's intended to be fairly
low-volume. The list name is diswww@mit.edu, and requests for
addition/deletion should be sent to diswww-request@mit.edu.

If you want more information about the gateway, send me mail.

PS.  The sources require that you have Discuss installed on your
     system.  Just in case you are interested, the sources for Discuss
     and some limited documentation are available by anonymous FTP
     from ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu/pub/ATHENA/discuss/discuss1.6.tar.Z

Subject: Using Mosaic and HTTPD with multiple network interfaces
Date: Fri, 27 May 1994 10:35:11 -0400
From: "Amarendranath <nath@src.umd.edu> Vadlamudi" <nath@src.umd.edu>
content-length: 1687



We are trying to use Mosaic and the CERN httpd to setup
a client-server connection between two Sun workstations..
Everything works fine when we use the standard le0 ethernet
interface for communication between the client and server.

However, for our situation we actually need to use two (maybe
more later) physical interfaces to each machine. One connection
is using PPP and the other is using Frame Relay. We have
configured the IP layer to recognize the different interfaces.

For instance, if one wants to telnet from one machine to the 
other using either protocol, one would simply say "telnet fr1"
for Frame relay or "telnet ppp1" for PPP. So in effect we 
use different IP addresses for each of the various interfaces.

I would like to setup the two machines
so that Mosaic sends out a request on the PPP connection to
the server and the server will deliver the data on the Frame
relay connection..

But since Mosaic sends the client address to the server when
it makes the connection, I am not sure how to even set about
achieving this goal.. 

Example: 
Client ppp1 makes a connection to server at ppp2 with a request, 
but the server should send a reponse back to client at fr1.

Is this possible at all ? How much work would it involve ?

Any help or pointers with getting this setup working 
will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

	I'm not comfortable with your choice of  "!",  though. 
Maybe it's because it  "looks like"  a shell escape.   (not that I'd 
ever advocate  *using*  such a thing)   ;-)   Maybe it's that I might 
want to use  "!"  for negation. 
 
	Also,  what about the  Nth occurance  instead of the first? 
Given that you're considering texts of which you are not the author, 
this might be a really handy addition,  eh?

	Problem:  byte offsets are *not* an interoperable metric. 
Some filesystems don't have a notion of  "this file contains n bytes". 
The number of bytes  PROBABLY CHANGES  as the document goes from server 
host storage (disk) to TCP (on-the-wire).   In many cases,  the  "document" 
is the output of a program and you'd have to hold the whole thing, 
count the bytes  (or at least count up to that point),  and then place 
the pointer.   A better metric would be a line offset or record offset, 
but I suspect that even that isn't suitable for  some case, somewhere.

	[disclaimer:  what I'm about to suggest comes from a (perhaps AR) 
POV that quoting should be avoided unless required to resolve ambiguity] 
 
	About the quoting idea:  what if we chose  #"  for your scheme? 
So a URL like  mydoc#myanchor  would work as you'd expect today, 
and a URL like  mydoc#"mytext"  would look for the text as you suggest. 
Maybe someone will suggest another  "quoting"  method  (in which case 
I can throw away my disclaimer above as I embrace the better idea). 
Parenthesis?  Brackets?  Braces?

Subject: Re: statelessness
content-length: 1464

Earlier this month there was a brief discussion on state in HTTP servers,
which I just now got around to reading.  For anyone interested, I've
got an experimental server which maintains state by controlling subprocesses,
assigning them to clients and keeping track of it all.  This allows arbitrary
state to be kept in the server, since you can write any program you want
to keep the state.  Plus it doesn't clutter up the http daemon with any
kind of data description language, which might otherwise be required in
order to allow keeping arbitrary state usefully.

The server is accesable at <http://alumni.caltech.edu:8000/>, source for
the program is also available there.  A fair number of people have poked
around there, but so far no one has made any comments.  I view it as
an interesting exercise, but probably not useful for anything real.

My current opinion is that client-side state is definitely the way to go.
One reason: the user can pause the client, vacation for a week, then
continue querying with the state saved in the client (or saved to a
client-side file somewhere).  If the server keeps state, no matter what

for which there is no good solution. (The session concept has the same

be shut down after some amount of inactive time?)

	Right.   And Internet Mail is broken.   Let's not see HTTP 
break because someone misinterpreted the spec.   We need to clarify this. 
I say that we should clarify it in the looser direction w/r/t plain 
text and trailing whitespace in particular.   I see no reason to 
penalize clients and servers that have platform limitations ... 
unless it's just out of spite.   What's the deal, Dan?

	If by this statement you're pointing out a misimplication 
in my note,  I accept the correction.   I didn't mean to suggest 
that HTTP is for human consumption.   What I *did* (still do) 
mean to suggest is that,  to the greatest extent possible, 
HTTP be clearly defined as a  PLAIN TEXT  protocol. 
 
	I think we all agree that  "plain text"  protocols are a 
Good Thing.   But we've agreed to that without bothering to define 
what on earth  "plain text"  is.   I don't think  HTTP  should be the 
protocol to bear the  plain text  torch,  but I think it'd be foolish 
to plow blindly forward without thinking carefully about it.  There's 
so much in HTTP that's wonderful,  things like the URL being a single 
blank-delimited token;  see it all the way through!   (you'd better be 
discarding any trailing white space from your GETs;  are you???) 
 
	That's why I said ... 
 
> >     Try this:

	Better:  "a line of text is end-of-record terminated", 
where  end-of-record  is defined by local O/S considerations.

	And add one more:  TAB and SPACE process the same. 
 
	This isn't arbitrary,  it fits the  "be conservative about 
what you generate and liberal about what you accept"  rule. 
(or do we disagree about that too?) 
 
> Let us keep the HTTP protocol clear and free of such kludgery.
 
	This is not kludgery!   This is robust design.

	Certainly.   Any HTTPD will have to map local conventions to 
on-the-wire streams.   Any HTTPD will have to map end-of-line to 0x0D 0x0A. 
We can make certain demands of the various HTTP server implementations. 
I say we *not* demand that  "plain text"  (including HTTP headers) 
be anything more than outlined above. 
 
> Similarly for the blank line that ends the headers: I'm not sure if

	That's the problem.   It doesn't specify! 
 
	I'd support a clarification that it  NEED NOT  be empty. 
If you specify that it  MUST BE EMPTY  (eg: CR/LF/CR/LF)  then 
at least you've specified,  but you'll have tightened the spec 
in the direction of least ease of implementation.

	And they're beyond the scope of this argument.   But ...

	Which can safely become  LF, LF, LF  on a UNIX client host. 
You wouldn't want the  "save to disk"  option to leave those CRs in 
there,  would you?   Still,  here too,  any trailing white space should 
be considered fair game.

Just a quick note on how we see HTML+ going in the immediate future,
this is taken from the HTML+ workshop at WWW'94. Proper minutes where
the difference between my opinions and those of others can be distinguished
will be posted in due course :-)

1) First priority is to build a coherent spec defining what we do now to
give to the commercial companies.

2) HTML+ should start to emmerge soon. This will offer much better support
for tables and figures. Maths will follow.

3) We have been discussing with companies which work in the special needs
field. We are confident that the spec we have can be made to interoperate
with SGML markup developed specifically for braille and voice synthesis.
The move to HTML+ will be used to encourage a move away from some HTML
markup conventions that are a problem in this area.

On this point there will be some negotiating and bargaining between the spec
editors over resolving legacy issues between HTML+ and DTDs designed for
special needs. BTW this process takes time and also means that the process
of standardisation cannot be the usual internet model of the first person
to produce code. This is not an electronic democracy but a meritocracy. Some
peoples votes count for more than others because of the people they represent.
Those providing support for people with special needs, both at the
severe level and less severe such as dyslexia have a rather more influential
say than certain others.


That said the issue of style and style sheets is very important. The main
priority though is supporting the forms of expression such as tables
and maths which are currently not supported before doing pretty fonts etc.
That said support for many items such as centering just falls out after a
proper implementation of tables has been done. We prefer to defer thinking
about this until the current changes are more complete.

We want to be able to support magazines which have a strong typographical
impact such as WiReD. We don't see that allowing the publisher to give
more typographical information is a bad thing. On the other hand we do
not intend to produce a page description language or move to a paged 
display model in the near future. 

Keeping it simple while still allowing powerful expression is the objective.
It is not our aim to produce a spec that is simple through not being
functional. We want to be both functional and simple.

I don't consider it spite. I just consider it clean design.

We clearly disagree. I think both sides of the argument have
been presented. I don't plan on writing any code in this area
any time soon, so it's really up to somebody else to decide
what to deploy. I might try to influence the HTTP spec editor,
though :-)

I disagree. Internet mail and USENET news serve a community
that is not tied together by reliable 8-bit protocols. HTTP
does. I see no reason to support multiple representations
of the same information in HTTP headers.

For example, look at XDR (part of NFS, etc.). Some systems
are little-endian and some are big-endian, but they all write
the bytes on the wire in the same order.

Indeedy weedikins they can.  But PS is notorious for its lack of
links and for looking grotty on a display (Ok - Display postscript
looks nice, but Ghostscript ain't it!) 

In effect - we'd turn our web into a glorified FTP server, while we
want to link all this stuff together, and put annotations on it, and
display it on VT100 terminals.  Decompiling postscript (especially 
arbitrary postscript) is _hard_ and you lose a lot of content on
the way.  ok: is this bold thing a header or is it a definition?

PS is not quite what we want.  PDF is closer to the intersection of
the web and publishers wants.  New PDF with links will be better.
Now if they would only give away the viewers PDF could flourish on
the web.

Ugly hack:
hack the client to send a 
	Reply-To: <ip-address> 
along with its other HTTP requests (Accept: foo/bar ...).

Then hack the server so it groks Reply-To.  That's the software
version of fixing this - it sucks because it ties you to this
particular server and this particular client.

Better hack:
Hack the IP interface to reroute packets going down to PPP1 to
FR1.  Still ugly - and loses if you only want to redirect Mosaic
packets.  (or vice-versa: get PPP to make believe it is on frame
relay.  Get Mosaic to lie about its present IP address...  This
requires that the FR client (? - what is on the FR node anyway?)
to lie convincingly too.

Best hack:
Avoid the situation altogether; live with slow PPP connection
or drop PPP altogether...

This doesn't solve one of the big performance problems when using http,
which is the cost of establishing a connection for every single request. 

Timing out connections is not that big a problem; if the connection hasn't
been used for a while, then the extra delay involved in restablishing a 
connection doesn't matter - it's repeated connections that really 
cause the problems.

Christian's hack isn't *that* ugly, when you consider that it
could be used for web robots and slideshows as well.  It
does need to be Reply-To: <socket>, instead of just <ip>.

If one didn't mind generally making the connection between
the machines asymmetric, it ought to be relatively easy to
modify the routing tables on both machines such that
A looks up B, and uses PPP0, then B looks up A, and uses FR0.

There is another problem too. SGML is inherently structured, and
current URL's offer no standard sub-document naming method, nor
support for TOC's etc. I have a short SGML document describing a
scheme that overcomes the problems (in the short term at least). If
anyone is interested, let me know. If sufficinet interest is shown,
I'll post it to the list. The basic idea is simply to do this:

   http://book/chapter=2/section=1/para=5

but there are other ideas in the paper as well (like named TOC's etc.)

  That's good to hear. If you are doing tables, I would recommend using

  In this case, I think it is good. A bad stabdard now could cause
  huge problems later. A good standard now will guarantee the

  In addition to the fine point you have made about different
  publishers wanting different typographical styles, I would add that
  SGML should only be used to define the structure of a document, not
  the formatting (which is where stylesheets come in). This allows
  things like structured searches top be performed very efficiently,
  and has other benefits as well (Machine independence for example.
  Could you *really* render HTML on a voice synthesis machine? How
  would it know when a new chapter in a book began? H? elements are
  used primarily for font effects in HTML...)

  A nobel idea. I am sure that you will do a fine job on HTML+.
However, I don't feel that any DTD will ever satisfy the needs of
everyone. I feel that HTTP needs to be extended to allow for
negotiation on DTD's, stylesheets, pay-per-use, encryption, and other
things in order for commercial publishers to be really successful. For
example: Say Encyclopedia Britannica was online. How could they charge
people for using it? What would stop someone in a country with lax
copyright laws from copying everything, and then putting it onto the
net somewhere? What if they had the Encyclopedia Britannica marked up
using an DTD they designed (down converting to HTML is possible, but
can produce weird results)?

I would like to see HTML+ as the common thread, where is all else
fails, every server, and every client should understand it, but I
would also like it to be possible to have clients and servers who are
aware of more than one DTD, and more than one stylesheet. As machines
become faster, and as the public domain SGML parsing engines become
better, and easier to use, there will be very little reason to
restrict client to only one DTD, and it seems short-sighted to do so. 

This is all IMHO of course.

I thougt that is why there was an initial discussion of besides a
URL, URN of a URF, for Universial Resource Fragment.

We have internally even floated the idea of extending it with one more a
URB for a universial citation identifier.  Not very much after that we
will need an URI - Universial Idenditifier for Intellectual Property
clearance, pointing to a master holder of IP-rights...

The URL,URI,URF,URN etc discussion is becoming extremely critical in my
opinion, and its time there is some movement through IETF or other channels..

I would like to state the case for being strict. The problems due to
misinterpretation of the spec should be solved by making the spec clearer
and unambiguous, not by making the servers ambiguous.

I take the middle line HTTP at present is designed to support debugging
using telnet. The developers want that. We should look towards the day
when we can go towards a more compressed binary form for header information.
This should be a clean replacement of the RFC822 idiom with something
else. But we dont have to and don't need to think about that at the moment.

Have to disagree with you here Dan. It is easy enough to make the protocol
byte order neutral so that the machines automaticaly detect and adapt to the
byte order being sent. Adopting one as a `standard' is unnecessary and a bit
pointless when the `standard' adopted by the internet is different to the
standard in the marketplace which is set by MSDOS, not by the handfull of
UNIX machines. All processors comming out today are bi-endian, protocols should
be as well.

The scheme I use in PROTOPLASM is to send a version encoding number at the
start of the stream. This has by definition bit 31 clear and bit 7 set. It
is sent out in the byte order as the sender by default. Doing this means that
the same code can be written for all platforms without ugly #ifdefs which
is a worthwhile saving in itself since kludges like configure arn't needed.

One thing we must insist on in any new scheme. It MUST have a version number
system worked out in advance so that we don't need the HTTP/1.0 kludges.

The CONTENT of the document returned is what has the filenames, not any
URL. So this stays with the notion of opaque URLs, unless you would argue
that putting wildcards in the request url in the first place is not
opaque.

Don't allow the server to "see" these directories. You can do this with
alias control. The concept of server-generated directory listings is very
powerful, and extends the capability of the Web in a truly useful way.

The NCSA and CERN HTTP servers support titles, and even automatically
extract the HTML title from HTML documents that appear in a directory. The
file names needn't mean anything. And you _do_ want to know the size before
fetching, right? And the last modified date so you can tell if it has
changed..., and you need to know the filename in order to "address" the
file and get it. I suppose you could hide the filename, omitting it from
the directory listing, and only show the title, size and last-mod date. But
I think the file name is useful.

The Windows NCSA server already supports the ability to have HREFs in the
titles. It also displays the size and last mod date. BUT... the intent of
permitting HREFs in the title is to permit annotations, to allow the title
to link to an expanded description for the file, not to hide the file name.
I don't see the benefit in hiding the file name in a directory listing.

The above discussion doesn't directly address the issue of using wildcards
in file names for server generated directory listings. Instead, it
addresses the issue of server-generated directory listings. It's a fact of
life that files have names, and that people deal with files by their name.
It seems to me that using HTTP/HTML to serve files (without authentication)
is a good idea. It sure gives a friendlier interface than anonymous FTP.

I explained wrong or you misunderstood.  Let me give an example.  Let's say
there's a directory with filenames like this:

83499A.htm
18132H.htm
BG602A.htm

Meaningless to most users, right?  That's what my generated filenames look
like.  I'm suggesting that if the client requests a directory list *.htm,
the default would be to a document back that looks something back like
this:

<title>Directory of myhost.mydomain.com/mydirectory/*.htm</title>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://myhost.mydomain.com/mydirectory/83499A.htm">This is the
title of the first file</a>

<li><a href="http://myhost.mydomain.com/mydirectory/18132H.htm">This is the
title of the second file</a>

<li><a href="http://myhost.mydomain.com/mydirectory/BG602A.htm">This is the
title of the last file</a>

</ul>

I'm suggesting that perhaps something like this should be the *default*
behavior, so that the default deals with information that's intended in all
cases to be meaningful to the user.  I have no objections to allowing other
behaviors, including returning the file names.

I don't mean to rule out including other directory-related information in
the HTML that's returned, such as creation and mod dates, etc.  Perhaps the
default might include those.  Maybe have switches to retrieve any and all
portions of the headers.

One of the great benefits, as I mentioned, could be to speed up robots and
spiders, who typically make a series of "GET HEAD" requests.  This would
effectively batch all of those together, at the server, instead of
requiring a long series of transactions.

I must agree with you. This problem is hurting not only the WWW but also
CORBA and other groups. One bad thing about the WWW is that you cannot
do an equivalency test on documents/objects. All we have is "if they have
the same name, then they are the same". This leads to one shortcoming of
the WWW: that even if a document of the same content resides on a local
web server, if the URL' points to Botswana, that is where it will be 
copied from. Without some for of equivalency test, doing anything about this
(like tracking documents/versions) is impossible. Perhaps we should try to
generate some suggestions for the IETF? I feel that this is a *hard* problem
though...

<SECTION>
<TITLE>Introduction</TITLE>
<PARA>
Recently, the World Wide Web project has gained a great deal
of momentum. The World Wide Web proposes to tie together all the
information sources available on the Internet, and has gained a great
amount of success by providing a single hypertext interface to such
services as Usenet, FTP, and mail. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
One of the crucial elements of the World Wide Web is the URL, or
Uniform Resource Locator. Currently, URL's appear much like a
Unix filename, with extensions for deciding the type of service to be
used, the port number for the server, and other such parameters. While
URL's are in wide use, they do suffer from a number of problems,
including object uniqueness and equality problems (CORBA is
currently facing similar issues). An IETF group is working to overcome
these problems, but one problem that remains is that all of an object
is retreived(except in searches), and that there is no way to take
advantage of the inherent structure in a correct SGML document. 
</PARA>
</SECTION>

<SECTION>
<TITLE>The URL syntax</TITLE>
<PARA>
The generic URL has the following structure:
<VERBATIM>
   scheme:path[?search|#fragment_ID]
</VERBATIM> 
where scheme names the service to use (ftp, wais, http etc.), path
specifies the location of the document, and the optional search
parameter specifies a list of keywords to search for. In theory, this
provides a single, simple naming scheme, but in practise, almost all
of the different servers use a slightly different syntax.
</PARA>
</SECTION>

<SECTION>
<TITLE>The URL Path Extensions</TITLE>
<PARA>
This document specifies extensions to the generic URL which can be
used in conjunction with SGML document servers to provide a much finer
level of control over what is to be retrieved. The extensions have, as
far as possible, been designed to be compatible with the concepts in both
the URL and HTTP RFC's. 
</PARA>

<PARA>
The key concepts are that an SGML document can be represented as a
tree of nodes, in much the same way that files and directories
correspond to nodes in the tree of the file system. As such, we can
map elements into an extended Unix path to create something like the
following: 
<VERBATIM>
   http://ebt.com/collection/book/chap=5/para=2
</VERBATIM>
where the extension syntax consists of an element GI and a specifier
saying which one of possibly multiple elements to chose. The equals sign
here is arbitrary. Any character that cannot be used in an element GI
in the Reference Concrete Syntax may be used (which agrees with the
TEI). In addition to element GI's the following keywords should be
supported: 

<TEXTLIST>
<TI>toc</TI><TT>Table of contents. If a specifier follows
                it is the name of the TOC to use.</TT>
<TI>max-bytes</TI><TT>Specify the maximum number of bytes to transfer. If
                the number of bytes exceeds this, generate a TOC as a
                guide to a more specific search. If the requested
                element is a graphic, scaling might be used, or a
                small icon attached to a hyperlink with a higher
                max-bytes value could be sent. </TT>
<TI>username</TI><TT>Specify the name of the user.</TT>
<TI>passwd</TI><TT>Specify the password to be used. The password is
                not encoded.</TT>
</TEXTLIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The grammar for the path extensions can be specified as:

<VERBATIM>
    extended_path_member ::= member_name optional_specifier
    member_name          ::= SGML_GI | '!' keyword
    keyword              ::= 'toc' | 'max-bytes' | 'username' | 'passwd'
    optional_specifier   ::= empty | '=' specifier_list
    specifier_list       ::= specifier | specifier ',' specifier_list
    specifier            ::= string | number
    number               ::= [0-9]* | [0-9]* '.' [0-9]*
    string               :: '"' character_constant '"'
</VERBATIM>
where the character constant rules follow the rules for ANSI C.
</PARA>
</SECTION>

The group of recognised keywords is currently very small, as time
goes by, this will be expanded to include ideas from the TEI, and
other groups. In addition, it is expected that the specifier data
format will be expanded over time to allow for selection based upon
attribute values. In addition, the choice of using the bang character
as a keyword marker is arbitrary, and may need to be reconsidered. A
sharp sign might be more suitable, but might confuse Mosaic.

<SECTION>
<TITLE>Other extensions</TITLE>

<PARA>
The following are a few extensions, or notes on how the extensions
mentioned above will work with the normal HTTP URL's.

<ENUM>
<ITEM>In HTTP, anything following the # character is interpreted as an
identifier for a fragment of a document. A set of keywords will be
used here to specify document fragments. Currently, the supported
keywords will be the same as those in the extended URL path space
grammar, with the addition of the following three:

<TEXTLIST>
<TI>ebt-search</TI><TT>For using the EBT query language in
                       searches</TT>
<TI>element</TI><TT>An arbitrary element number</TT>
<TI>node</TI><TT>The internal node identifier</TT>
</TEXTLIST>

</ITEM>

<ITEM> The normal HTTP search mechanism (the '?' character followed by
a '+' seperated list of keywords) will be supported.
</ITEM>

<ITEM> In addition to the normal HTTP search mechanisms, extended
searches using the EBT query language will be supported via text
following the fragment ID delimiter. Such searches would appear like
the following:   

<VERBATIM>
    http://collection/book/section#!ebt-search="foo within bar"
</VERBATIM>

</ITEM>

<ITEM> There will be some pathalogical cases where the above
extensions can be used to create an illegal URL. In such cases, the
server should move back up the path until a legal URL is created. For
example:

<VERBATIM>
    <a href="http://ebt.com/collection/book/!toc/!toc/!toc/list=2">
</VERBATIM>

is basically meaningless. This should be reduced to:

<VERBATIM>
   <a href="http://ebt.com/collection/book/!toc">
</VERBATIM>

which is legal, but perhaps not what the user wanted. If a legal URL
cannot be found, an error should be returned.
</ITEM>

<ITEM>
By supporting multiple named TOC's, is is possible to easily create
alternate views of the document. For example, it should be  possible 
to have lists of figures etc.
</ITEM>
</ENUM>
</PARA>

Let me announce I'm interested in this problem as well.  We're working
on a system for replication of files across organizational boundaries,
and one obvious application is distribution of web documents to
alleviate hot spots and long distance queries.  We need URLs that are
relative, and we also need a way to check whether two documents are
the same.  (Actually, there's even more to the problem.  Time-outs are
probably needed for a wide set of scenarios and intermediate
distribution agents are needed for other scenarios.)

Yes, I understand. You want the file name hidden, and a textual title to
replace the file name in the directory index as the hot-spot.

Where would we get the titles for the (non HTML) files? This could be a
daunting task on a large library. The current servers don't prevent
information "meaningful to the user" from being displayed, they just don't
require it. You can set up a title for a file, if you dont, and it's HTML,
the server will extract the title automatically and show it, else no
description is shown, just the file name. In this case, it is the choice of
the system administrator. I prefer the laissez faire approach.

At this point, being a server developer, I am going to bow out of the
discussion. I will implement that which is deemed "right".

Well, yes, things do need to be added to the transaction layer, but
that shouldn't affect too much how the document language should be 
constructed.  Pay-per-use (hooray for David Chaum's great keynote
address at WWW'94!) and encryption belong at the HTTP layer (along 
with server-side and client-side programs), while stylesheets are an
issue above HTML.  Define a strong document language, and the stylesheets
will be created with ease.  As for arbitrary DTDs... aren't they really
different document types, and thus should have unique MIME types anyways?
Additionally, the level of programming browsers would need to properly
display arbitrary DTD's would be huge, and these browsers are big enough
already.

Actually, they are setting up an online service (www.eb.com?).  I
think the model they are using is to sell the service to institutions
(universities, etc) and use access control restricted to
*.berkeley.edu, for example.  However, if any server in that domain
has open proxying supported (as the CERN server does - does NCSA's?)
then *anyone* can get that information, as the proxy service is open
to anyone (or is it configurable?).  I see this as analogous to the
easily-forgeable sendmail problem awhile back, which was solved via
the enlightened self-interest of the sendmail authors to enable
complete tracing, so that unauthenticated mail could never be fully
anonymous.  Hopefully a similar solution will become available for
proxy servers - the best solution I can think of is to simply pass
along the name of the originating host, or perhaps even the complete
path.  If this is currently in the HTTP spec let me know.

OK first off re keeping the layers separate, very good point. Before we put
security enhancements or rather enhancements for security into HTML we
have to put them into the transport layer. Both Dave Ragget and myself
are working on the security side as well as the HTML+ side so we are
aware of the issues, state of play etc.

The issues of authentification etc should be the subject of some RFC proposals
in the near future. For a preview of Shen see :-

http://alephinfo.cern.ch/AL2F01$DKA100/hallam/INFOGEN/SECURITY/REF/security_spec.html

NB the scope of Shen is very much wider than just HTTP or HTML. The
idea is to provide the security support required for non browser
applications.

The issue of style sheets is `defered' we want to look at them but the 
form they take cannot be decided until we have got a few less balls in the
air. NB DTDs are no damn use as they stand for this purpose. They define
document structure, not presentation. 


There are some changes required to HTML+ for security. These include the
use of logos and trademarks in a defined area that does not scroll. We
also have to support writing "Top Secret" or "Confidential" in this area.
The linking of DNs to trademarks is an issue.

Whenever you get a copy of WiReD you know it is genuine because it has the
trademark stamped on the front cover. Misuse of a trademark is a criminal
act in many countries when the intent is counterfeiting.

There will be support for prohibit copy, prohibit cache etc.

Errrm sorry, it is quite possible to forge non traceable mail but I'm
not going to let on how.

The issue of support for proxying etc is being thought of but we are
not there yet. The big question is about the level of trust you place
in the client. In any copyright protection system you have to put some 
faith in the user and client.

I would be interested in knowing what requirements you have of testers.  (I 
have seen your later mail making it clear that you do want testers NOT 
devlopers).

I am looking at putting up a server shortly, so this could fit in quite nicely.

There are a number of apps where some sort of state is inevitable. For the
security extensions state must be maintained to prevent replay attacks. It is
not possible to use the time/date for this purpose because not all machines
have GMT and those that do are often baddly configured.

The security extensions also require state to ensure that the first time
a secure area is accessed a warning notice is displayed. This is a legal
requirement to enable prosecution of malicious unauthorized use.


For database operations it seems best to track the state in a manner that
prevents the server having to unnecessarily keep state over periods of years.
For this limiting the detailed state requirements to the persistence of the
connection. This provides a nice balance and allows the clients and servers
to be relatively simple, requiring no long term storage of state.

If we want to look into keeping state outside the connection context then 
we should think about Prospero or other protocols. HTML is only meant to
be logicaly equivalent to the universal set of web protocols. We do not have
to optimise for every last case.

I like this idea, and would like to see a post.  We have some
people interested in building a document management system, and
it would require granularity beyond the "document", and down to
the containers/entities.

There was another reply after this that discussed the URx structures
that are grappling with this problem (as well as CORBA).  IMHO these
are critical issues to getting to a robust collaborative environment, 
where things are continously edited.  Many of these features can
be thought of in terms of Lotus Notes, which really is a pertinent
model for development of HTML+/HTTP/URx.

I never argued for stylesheets in HTTP, only the negotiation of
stylesheets, and DTD's. One advantage of SGML is that you can have
many different stylesheets for the same document. If you make each DTD
a special mime type, then how do you negotiate for the stylesheets or
DTD's to use? What I am arguing for is something entirely
open-ended... 

>Additionally, the level of programming browsers would need to properly

This is not true. Again, I was arguing for some negotiation protocol
on SGML-awareness; the SGML standard itself has levels of conformance
defined. Many light-weight browsers could limit themselves to one
particular DTD, or exclude some features of SGML to simplify parsing,
but even this, I feel will be unnecessary. If someone took SGMLS and
cleaned it up, and connected the output to a rendering system, we
would have a pretty good system, at the cost of probably 250k. Now if
the browsers used only HTTP, a lot of the lower-level protocol layer
could be removed, *removing* 250k. We're even. Other protocol types
*could* be handled outside the browser...

I agree that a more "heavyweight" protocol for online odocument
delivery is desired. For a lot of commercial publishers, the
connection time penalty will become a serious problem. However, I do
not think that a lower-level protocol for screen display is needed.
All that is needed is more intelligent renderers. Beside, there are
half a dozen protocols for distributed graphics (NAPLS, RFC??? etc.).
With intelligent renderers, stylesheets, arbitray DTD's, pay-per-use,
and encryption, etc. the WWW will live a long life indeed. Without all
of these, I feel it will never live up to it's full potential.

What happens when each of these scripts invokes a multi-megabyte
frontend? Every time a connection over HTTP comes in, we reexecute it.
There *are* ways around this, but I think they feel kludgy.

I addressed this earlier. All I asked for was a *negotiation*
protocol. Nothing more.

Correct, that is why they *are* "damned usable". By defining *only*
structure, they are formatting independent, meaning you can *present*
that data any way you please. The *presentation* is usually defined by
a *style sheet*, bringing us a full circle. One of the *worste* parts
of HTML is that it defines *presentation*, meaning that every document
on the Internet in HTML relies upon the formatting properties of HTML,
and must be updated if those semantics change. You must be pacing
problems now where you have to maintain backward compatibility with
older documents in HTML+. If HTML had defined structure, and a
"default" stylesheet, that problem would not be anywhere near so
great, particularly if the browsers understood arbitrary DTD's, and
stylesheets associated with them. There are a lot of people out there
with *huge* amount of data (800,000 pages is common), and they want to
be able to analyse that data using the structure of SGML (searches are
fast too), you don't get *that* with HTML. My question, as always, is
simply: why go for a restricted solution to a problem, when, with 
slightly more work, one could go for a truly general solution? It's
kind of like the story of the doctor in India: She saw a drowning man
in the river, swam out, and brought him to shore, then 2 men came
down the river, she swam out, and saved them too, then 4 men, then 16
men, and she was so busy saving people, she never did manage to stop
the person throwing the men into the river.

How about areas of text visible only to those who should see it? Do
you send it across the wire, and use an attribute to tell the browser
to hide it, or do you ask the server not to send it? In the former
case, we need encryption, in the later, SGML aware servers...

Do you think this will stop people from copying it? I remember well
the days when most software came with copy protection, and people
spent *weeks* breaking it, and then distributing copies. On a network
of 20,000,000 people, do you think trademarks will work? How about in
countries where there are no laws, or where the government just
doesn't care?


I'm sorry if I come over a bit strong, but I feel the WWW could be one
of the most important things to have ever come along, but I feel that
it is has surpassed anyone's wildest dreams with it's success, and if
some problems aren't fixed soon, we might be stuck with them for
good... it's full of so many possibilities, let's not waste them.

My hat *does* go off to all have have brought the net this far, and it
will be ready for those who take it further.

Postscript is functionally a write-only medium.  Once a document has been 
instantiated in Postscript, little further interpretation is possible 
without a full Postscript interpreter.  

Consider a link within a PS document. Without a full PS intrepreter embedded 
in each renderer, such a link is useless.  In the simpliest instance, how 
can I know the positioning of the link without rendering the entire page? 

Once a document is expressed in HTML, there are lots of things I'd like to
and can do with it.  Further intrepretation and manipulation of information 
is the goal of any good information system, not only presentation. 

The problem is richness of presentation AND the functionality of 
non-linearly structured information.

The same argument could be made against HTML to a degree. By
down-converting into HTML, you lose information in much the
same way. HTML documents are generally not as structured as they
could be...

And yes, HTML is not as structured as it HAS to be, but that is another

Ah, I think I see... I was interpreting style sheets as analogous to
templates (i.e., we have a style sheet for each section of the online
version of our magazine, to try and give a coherent look to things).
I now realize you mean stylesheets as in, "this is how to render this
arbitrary DTD".  This I am more comfortable with, definitely, though I
think there is a long way to go in improving what we have before
attacking this problem (even though I hear your point made in the
subsequent parable about the Indian about attacking problems at their
root level rather than their symptoms).

As to whether arbitrary-DTD SGML browsers could be made lightweight, I
defer that to more knowlegable people, as I have almost no experience
in SGML (though since it is an environment I figured it would be a 
rather large beast).

If a lot of work could be put into making the X protocol as compact and
compressible as possible (I heard there were benefits in X11R6 but I'm
not sure) I think this could be the way to go.  Add in better security
and we're set.  X Windows can run on just about every platform out there,
and there is a large cache of usage-history to draw from.

This is more of a technical issue, but I'll make an attempt at
commenting on it anyways.  The system overhead to open sockets for
every transaction isn't necessarily higher than keeping one socket
open for a period of time.  I do expect to see large commercial
publishers getting web hits on the order of NCSA's 100,000/day within
the next year, but with a combination of strong servers and
round-robin IP addressing this isn't necessarily a problem.  The
back-end databases I envision most publishers will be setting up for
interactive services will probably dwarf the IP overhead.  Combine
that with proposals for an MGET method in HTTP, and the connection

No one disagrees, the question is simply where is the most appropriate
place in the spectrum of protocols and standards and what is the
appropriate level of attention to pay to each.

Multimegabyte programs on the server you mean?  Modular programs, of course...

Well, our trademark logo isn't necessarily a mark of authentication, of
course - someone with a full-color photocopier could make an attempt
to copy it, and it would of course be illegal.

Trademarks will of course work as they always have.  I'll avoid
getting into issues of copyright and trademark and "the net being
above the law" as it doesn't really belong on www-talk - for an
interesting discussion on it check out the MTV vs Adam Curry debate
on the newsgroups.  But I will say that these issues don't have to 
necessarily be a separate part of either the document language or
HTTP - simply give us authentication and encryption and I think
publishers will be happy.

But Notes is a monolithic database.  It only works because servers
spend a lot of time synchronizing databases.  It only looks distributed.
Is there something that can be applied to a distributed/heterogeneous
web?

Actually, I once considered:

Stephen, 

Indeed, the URN work answers only some of the important questions.  The
higher purpose here, I believe, is to answer this question: 

"What information do we need to make an "appropriate" retrieval decision?"

I've been thinking about this for some time and have a short list of
questions. 

<SOAPBOX ON>

Before I present them, I'd like to go on record once again and state my
belief that this is the single most important issue facing the global
Internet short of the exhaustion of the address space. 

As an on-line publishing enabler, we have seen what happens when an 
Internet repository achieves even the least level of notoriety.  

In some cases, this has had a positive effect and has been used to limit 
socially irresponsible behavior.   See "Canter and Siegal."

But consider the current barriers which traditional publishers face when
providing useful and popular information to their customers.  

I have had to turn away business -- or have lost potential business on the
basis of cost -- because we could not support the infrastructure required
without unfairly requiring the publisher to shoulder the entire cost of
delivery.  (And the business I lost did not go elsewhere. Currently no 
one is capable of supporting it.)

I say "unfairly" because we already have support for cost effective
information distribution in the real world.  There are trucking companies
and bookstores and fulfillment houses which exist and compete with each
other to keep costs down.  The publisher can leverage these existing 
services.

On-line, we have no such extant infrastructure and without it -- or a
technical infrastructure which supports the on-line analog -- publishing
on the global Internet will remain what it is now, an unsupportable and 
ineffective hack. 

It's a "chicken and egg" problem.  Without an established technical
infrastructure, the publisher cannot participate in anything other than a
cursory fashion, and without the publisher -- and its content -- there is
little incentive to provide this infrastructure. 

This is not simply a commercial issue. Interesting content is interesting 
irrespective of its pricing model.

And I fear that, should we look, we would find a full 40% of resource 
object retrieval across the Internet to be ill considered and wasteful.

<SOAPBOX OFF>

Ok, What do we need to know to make an "appropriate" retrieval decision?

First, let's assume the following:

	- a URN is -- AT THE VERY LEAST -- a reference to a collection of
	  zero or more URLs.

	- a URL uniquely identifies a single instance of a resource object

	- a resource object is some thing which can be retrieved from a
	  repository

	- a repository is a collection of resource objects which supports 
	  one or more methods of external retrieval

Our goal:

	- an appropriate retrieval decision must provide an optimal solution
	  in terms of the provider's resources, the consumer's use, and the 
	  use of the network infrastructure between provider and consumer.

The questions --

	(Consumer Use Questions)

	- if we retrieve this URL, can we use what we get?
	- ... do we have enough local cache to hold a copy?
	- ... is it in a form we can use (render/manipulate)?
	- ... ... is it in a language we can understand?
	- ... ... if it is non-text, can we use it without conversion?
	- ... ... ... can we convert it to a form we can use?
	- ... ... is it compressed?
	- ... ... ... can we uncompress it?

	- ... is there a fee to retrieve and use it?
	- ... ... can we afford it?
	- ... ... can we pay for it?

	(Repository Use Questions)

	- is the repository active?
	- ... do we have permission to use it?
	- ... does it support a retrieval service we can use?
	- ... is it free enough from use to acceptably fulfill the request?

	(Network Use Questions)

	- which repository is the closest?  
		(Where "close" is measured in terms of 
			network distance (hops),
			cost of bandwidth, 
			timeliness of response)

Who can answer these questions --

	(Easiest to Hardest)

	The consumer or her agent is most able to answer the Consumer Use 
	Questions.  The renderer "knows" what it can render, what it can 
	convert, what it can interpret.

	The repository is the only place to answer the Repository Use 
	Questions since it is the only comprehensive source of the answer.
	
	(It is possible to query the "main" repositories from some central
	service to monitor its load and accessability.  This implies a far
	larger intrenched infrastructure than we currently support.)

	Now, the hardest...

	I believe it is only truely appropriate to answer the Network Use 
	Questions at the consumer's site.  To be able to effectively 
	retrieve, I or my agent needs to know a hell of a lot about the 
	intervening network infrastructure than you might expect.  

Here's and example:  Assume I live in Los Angeles and know that O'Reilly 
and Associates has something really nifty to retrieve.  (Easy assumption, 
that. ;)

Now, I find that ORA has two servers, one in Cambridge MA and one in 
Sebastapool CA.  Which do I choose?

Well, (and this is obviously a stacked deck) Sebastapool would be the 
worst choice since ORA's Sebastapool office is connected to the network  
through Cambridge.

The user should never have to know any of this. 

As someone who provides mechanisms for publishers to provide content to 
consumers, I am EXTREMELY interested in exploring this problem and 
helping to provide a workable solution.

I assume that when you say "prohibit" you mean "request that it not be
done"?  This brings up the whole interesting issue of whether it is
irresponsible to create something that provides the appearance of
security without actually providing it.  If publishers send
information out onto the wire, people will be able to copy it and give
it away.  If they are under the illusion that they can do anything
more than make it inconvenient to do so, well...

I think this problem pretty much goes away if you price your
information appropriately and in small chunks.  How much time would
you waste searching for a old pirated copy of the Britanica entry on
Uganda if you could get the authoritative, up-to-date entry from the
source for only $1?

Designing clients to they are trustworthy necessarily means designing
clients so they are not powerful and extensible.  There's a real
trade-off involved in how much we're willing to cripple client
software in order to provide a false sense of security to existing
publishing entities clinging to old ways.

I wonder if the easiest way of handling searching with HTTP is to add 
a SOLO method? Paul-Andre has already added SOLO support to libwww, and
SOLO is comprehensive enough to cover most searches simple enough that
you'ld want to handle them with HTTP.

It depends where you come from, who you are and what you're doing.  If
you're a relatively well off resident of a fully developed nation, $1
might well be much less than your time spent searching for the
information would cost.  However, if you're poor, $1 might seem like an
awful lot and you're time would be effectively free in comparison, so
you'd probably hunt out the pirate copy.  Also, say you wanted
information on all the countries in the world; then you $1/entry could turn
into a several hundred dollar query.  Thats an awful lot of paper
encyclopedias.

Hello all -

My question might seem slightly weird but - here i go :)


Is there a way to do a global "reverse-order" of text inside an HTML 
document (from "document" to "tnemucod"...;)) ? and, alternatively - is 
there a utility that can perform this revrsal task in ascii ?? (which can 
later be converted to HTML format...)

thanks for your advice,
Tsam.

Errrrm...I won't ask why you need this :-)

Is rev(1) any use ?
Here is the man:
REV(1)                   USER COMMANDS                     REV(1)

NAME
     rev - reverse the order of characters in each line

SYNOPSIS
     rev [ filename ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     rev copies the named files to the standard output, reversing
     the order of characters in every line.  If no file is speci-
     fied, the standard input is copied.

Inferring from your email address, in particular the country code, I have this 
advice to give:

Don't do this. Its a hack. Get a browser that supports right to left ordering 
properly.

At WWW94 I spoke to Toshihiro Takada about Mosaic-L10n, the internationalised 
Mosaic, and we found that a mixture of hebrew and english was rendered 
incorrectly. (All english or all hebrew is OK). He is now looking at the 
problem, which goes like this:

hebrew-words-1 english-word hebrew-words-2 gets rendered on screen as

  hebrew-words-1 english-word hebrew-words-2|
  <<<<<<<<<<<<<  >>>>>>>>>>>> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<|margin

in other words you get the second bit of the sentence first (reading right to 
left). The correct algorithm requires scanning ahead to detect changes to a 
labguage written with a different direction, rendering it to a buffer or 
otherwise determining the length, saving the position, offsetting by the length 
and rendering it into the gap. This algorithm will also work for snippets of 
hebrew in english text.

<soapbox>
although I do not myself speak any languages that require other than ISO 
Latin-1, I regard multinational support as crucial to the success of the Web, 
assuming we want to go on calling it the World Wide Web and not the Much of 
Western Europe plus the United States Narrow Web. Otherwise we disenfranchise 
huge sections of the user population.

Hello all,
 
I'm trying to install the htngate/htn2html software but I cant 
get it running.

I have the complete Hytelnet system(which works fine) but can't register
the service in my inetd.conf on port 8002.

Is there any maintainer of this software? 
Or someone who knows more about it?

Thanx,

>From the recent WWW conference it became evident that many people had a
confusion between HTML+ and HTTP.  Specifically, there was a large body
of opinion towards placing type information into HTML.  For example,
placing within the HTML+ document information such as "here's a picture,
and the alternative text for the image is blah blah blah".  e.g.
	<FIG src=/some-image>
	If you don't have image viewing capability, you'll see this text
	</FIG>

The belief is that clients which cannot display images (or audio, or
whatever) should be able to display something.  IMHO, this model this
seems to be completely incorrect, as it merely duplicates (badly) the
format negotiation protocol already present in HTTP.

It was even suggested that many different types of alternatives to be
inlined within a document (e.g. <alt type=audio/basic>DATA</alt><alt
type=text/plain>Hello world</alt>), which could lead to huge data files
being downloaded, when the user only EVER wants to see one of the types
of data object.  The best comparison here is between audio and images. 
A visually impaired client will typically only want the audio
descriptions of images and if it has to download the complete image
every time it asks for a soundbite, it will double (at least) the amount
of data the client needs to download.

When you request a URL from a server, you transmit information
specifying exactly what data formats you understand.  If you have a line
mode browser, it will not request objects of type image/gif or whatever.
 This allows the server to find the best "fit" to the requirements and
return that object and only that object. This also means that the type
of object returned may very well NOT be the same type as determined by
heuristics on the URL extension.

A case in point: we have several maps on our Web site which are
"clickable"/"ismap'd", allowing users to select objects within the
image.  When viewed from a graphical client, this works as expected. 
When viewed from a text only client, a menu is given showing textual
descriptions of the objects within the image.  It works because of the
usage of different methods in HTTP, and because the client will not ask
for an inlined image.  If the inline image tag was corrected to be a
generic inline include which could cope with different media types, then
this system would work with even more ease.  This is a simple system to
maintain, as the ismap data and the menu data come from the same source,
on the fly.

This leads to one of the valid points in the argument for placing
alternative data within an object: maintenance.  If the objects are
always brought in from the server then it means to some extent that each
alternative must be in a seperate object, typed individually.  This
could lead to an unhappy webmaster looking after the web, maintaining
many files per document.  This may be true, but it is a problem to be
addressed by making a better scheme for editing and serving objects.  It
should not be addressed by placing all of the data into the same object
with conditional display clauses: the only way that works is if the user
edits the objects using raw HTML, with "vi" or similar.  This is not the
way forward;  editors are appearing and will appear with greater
facility for looking after a true hypertext document (rather than merely
understanding HTML) in the future.  This is the area in which
alternative object types should be examined.

Reply-To: charles_ashley@cosmos.learned.co.uk

Hi there -

Some criticism on the Lynx from WWW94...

Not too impressed with your Lynx WWW94 Special.  If you are going to continue  
this sort of publishing venture, do it right.  Hire professional journalists,  
not computer hacks typing from their diaries.  Not every reader is a computer  
hack.  It doesn't do your publication much good, nor does it make a very good  
impression of WWW94 who weren't there.

I thought Bill Thompson's comments - written in a style which looks like they  
were straight out of a notebook - were incomplete as best.  Benefit of the  
doubt: perhaps he just didn't go the right sessions.

Arguably the 3 top issues of WWW94:
- DigiCash
- HTML+ (what, when, where...)
- VRML & modelling cyberspace

Of these, the Lynx mentions the first one.  Hard not to, since everybody was in  
attendance.  But where are the more in-depth comments from David Chaum? How  
will DigiCash work?  Was he asked to expand on some of his themes in any way?   
How did his views go down with the audience?  


No mention of the ongoing HTML+ debate, a key issue affecting all Webbers. ALOT  
of time was spent on this issue.

Very little mention of VTML & 3-d webspace, although there was a workshop and  
alot of talk about it.

So, what's the beef?  If you guys are going to claim to have titles like editor  
and reporter, do things properly.  Proper journalism, please!

I have no problem with The Lynx WWW94 Special Report if it's for "internal use  
only", as a publication for the whole world via the Web?  I worry that you are  
giving the Web developer community a bad name with sloppy "journalism", and in  
fact doing damage to the Web community itself by trivializing many of the  
issues.  To quote;"...only six people at Robert Cailliau's session were  
Web-initiates, and one of them was Tim Berners-Lee's father!"

It's all very exciting doing an online journal.  But please remember that  
people actually read this stuff, not all of them familiar with internetworking  
and webs of information.  Is "amateurism" something we want associated with WWW  
publishing?

I hope some of this criticism will be of use to your future issues, and to the  
Web community at large.

Have you been following the talk about Trader's in
the ISO ODP  (Open Distributed Processing) work
being done?

Basically, a trader is an active agent that maintains a
rights to a repository of services. Clients contact
the trader, specify their requirements, and get back
ordered lists of candidate server requirements.

There is a lot more to it than that, and I
can give you pointers to the committe members
if you want.

I think the "chunking" idea is still the way to go.  Any useful browser 
under the current window systems will let the user copy the information 
somehow (even if has to be screen-shot by screen-shot).  Just a basic 
fact-of-life/feature/opportunity/bug in computing.

It will be interesting (if I live that long) to see how society copes with 
the ability to copy physical objects cheaply under nanotechnology...

Errm a little more. In order to fudge the thing you have to have access
to the private key. This can be prevented in the large site set up (eg
CERN) where the key that the vendor responds to is not accesible by the
employees. On a home site it is party time of course. There is no way I 
can prevent home users being naughty but I can make it a little harder...

We are making the levels of security quite clear. The security is limited to
that of the private key. As it is J random hacker at CERN or MIT will not be
able to read confidential documents and then export them off site. But
this will not prevent the likes of the members of the crypto-lab.

Nope, the idea of the prohibit channels is not really for the likes of
WiReD. By the time second hand copies are passed round it will be
avaliable for free from the archive site, archive is free, current you
pay is what we want to encourage.

The prohibit channels are more for security clearance systems and very
high levels of security. They are not primarily intended for the magazine
market.


Remember this is a revenue maximising operation, not a copy prevention one.
On the home market there will be people breaking copyright just as they do
with cassettes, CDs and videos. What I can guarantee though is that a good
system manager will be able to guarantee that Medical records etc are not
copied when they should not.

the WWW94 home page but couldnt find anything that indicated
where I could order the proceedings from.

Compliance!  Now there's a nifty idea.  What's the plan for arranging
for compliant software?

If there's a solution to this problem, then it would also be nice to
know which clients are safe and don't have exploitable holes in them.

Nope, because you cannot disable e. g. taking a photograph of the screen.
Or you disable displaying the secure data at all. :-(

Subject: Page breaks when you print formatted html docs

content-length: 936

Hi!

As an adjunct to preparing some lengthy documents in html for
viewing across the web, we'd like to be able to print the documents
in some nice-looking fashion.  Mosaic allows us to print the
postscript version, which includes the nice fonts, graphics, etc.
Is there any code we can imbed in the html doc which will force page
breaks at appropriate spots?  Like the tops of sections beginning
with <h1>, etc.?

Thanks!

The only way to stop copying is at the operating system level -- no MS or X 
Windows Clipboard, no screen shots, no copying of any data at all.  If the 
data can be copied in some close to clear-text form, it can be compromised. 
 Just look at how many commercial versions of UNIX now implement shadow 
password files.  If you want to protect the data, you have to completely 
protect the data.

Hi all,

I'm writing a index-tool for indexing the whole Uni-Ffm-WWW-space. That
means indexing several servers. Additional I want to generate meta-info
about the pages to feed it to my site.idx file for ALIWEB. The maintainers
of the servers should add the <meta tags> with information about the files,
wether the file should be announced in ALIWEB or not , and so on. I remeber
a thread some weeks ago about the <META> - tag and some proposals.

So, are there some standards meantime? Is there anybody who has developed
something in this direction I can use too?

regards

Two questions to those (Ari et al.) who are working on proxy and caching:

Recently, a new HTTP request header was introduced (Pragma: no-cache)
to make it possible for clients to ask intermediaries to refrain from caching
a document.  As I gathered from the discussion, its main purpose was to make
the Refresh function of clients actually refresh the document by causing it
to refresh any intermediate caches also.

Apparently, the name of this header doesn't match its intended
usage.  What you want is a request for the cache server to refresh the
document in cache, instead of bypassing the cache altogether.  My question:
don't we rather need a Pragma: refresh header?

The second question: several occasions have arisen in which it would be useful
for the remote server (not the client) to explicitly indicate that
the document sent must not be cached.  (For example, the case of WIRED,
where fragments of copyrighted material are cached, but copyright is not
on the individual fragments.)  Can I suggest that the Pragma: no-cache header
is added to the valid HTTP response headers?  (It's not yet there on

  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers.html

).  Maybe with an HTML equivalent, too.

Hi all,

does anyone have an answer to why there seem to be a lot of null's
in ncsa's logfile?

I noticed the problem when editing the file with vi and got the following
message:

"apa" 24707 lines, 3806181 characters (1705786 null)


When i saved the file after editing the null's went away.
The problem isn't that annoying but still it's 45% of the file size.

I think we should stay sensible about this screen copying thing. Lets face it,
copying a large document screen by screen is enough to drive you scatty.

I reckon that small-scale screen copying of some sort should be allowed. For
instance, suppose I download a medical document which I would like to
reference in my bibliography --- in that case I would like to be able to
copy the title and paste it into my bibliographic software. Surely this
cannot be wrong. If all kinds of copying are disabled, we risk angering users
to the point where they start cracking and begin using non-compliant software.

Since most folx who would answer this question were in Geneva last week
I'll ask it again:
 
Concerning the attributes of the anchor tag:

After looking over the current spec and picking apart the unstated but
possibly implied differences between HREF and URN, I have a question:
 
CAN <A URN="value"> mean retrieve the page that has this Uniform Resource
Name once it has been resolved into a URL?
 
Currently the spec says that the URN attribute only has value when in
conjunction with an HREF or a NAME.

>From the current HTML spec;
--
All attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary for the 
anchor to be useful. See also: LINK . 
--

Is this the intended meaning and if so can that intended meaning be changed
in order to accomodate URN->URL resolution?

Of course you can suggest that, but there is already the Expires: header which
gives the server complete control over when a document should be regarded
out-dated. If only information providers would support that header!

You could use the HTML+ element "META". Example:
 <meta name="keywords" value="image,compression,multimedia">
 <meta name="description" value="Hierachical Compression of
  5-D Image with 1-16 bpp">
Remember, META is a header element, don't put it in the body.

Maybe the ICE indexer could be of help - we'll do ALIWEB data
gathering real soon now (TM). Check out:

   Hi all,

   I'm writing a index-tool for indexing the whole Uni-Ffm-WWW-space. That
   means indexing several servers. Additional I want to generate meta-info
   about the pages to feed it to my site.idx file for ALIWEB. The maintainers
   of the servers should add the <meta tags> with information about the files,
   wether the file should be announced in ALIWEB or not , and so on. I remeber
   a thread some weeks ago about the <META> - tag and some proposals.

   So, are there some standards meantime? Is there anybody who has developed
   something in this direction I can use too?

   regards

At least once such tool is available... see

  http://www.ai.mit.edu/tools/site-index.html 

This documents a Perl script I wrote which indexes a site; it can
optionally build multiple indices with the disposition of a particular
document controlled by a <meta> tag with NAME="distribution".  On the
downside, it only works if you're running the NCSA server (it parses the
server config files to find the documents it has to index).

(If you've got another server, and want to try to adapt the script, you
should only have to change the function '&handle_ncsa_toplev' which reads
the config files, and then does one or several to the '&index_directory'
routine.  That routine takes a directory name and partial URL as arguments,
and does a file walk in that directory; it shouldn't have to be changed to
work with other servers).

WRT to the copying debate, I suspect that the ultimate solution to this
issue is to make it easier for people to find and use the originals than to
make their own copies.  As the volume of information that's usefully
accessible expands (thanks to better latency, smarter servers, etc.) I
suspect that navigational issues -- indexing, search, retrieval, etc., will
assure that most people won't bother to invest a lot of time and money
storing lots of stuff locally if it's accessible via the net.

It seems very counter-productive to me to try and stop people from copying
article, though I would like to see browsers that make it *much* easier to
re-use URLs and URNs, which would have the same effect.  If we create tools
that encourage people to share documents "virtually," a lot of the
intellectual property issues go away.  Ted Nelson has been saying this for
years, of course.

The purpose of this is to encourage people to write the text. At the end of
the day most people do not have editing tools capable of editing multiple
format documents.

Why are we so interested in the text? Simple the images do not work in
braille or in a voice synth.

To do it properly would require browsers to be able to include text chunks.
Unfortunately this is not really feasible within SGML.

No there is a coherent model. HTML contains only text and pointers to audio,
images etc. We have drawn the line at incorporating SMILES strings or
TeX or whatever. These can be linked via MIME though.

But there is no tage to state that you only want some HTML that does not
inline images. It is perfectly permissable to request a HTML that inlines
image formats that you cannot display and for the server to serve it. In
fact this is required, the server cannon know a priori what type of data
a link points to.

In general:

Compliance level IV	Designed for compliance.
Compliance level III	Tested in accordance with approved suite
Compliance level II	Synthesized from the specs
Compliance level I	Validated as correct using approved technology.


For security compliance there would have to be `whole system' checks.
Validation could only be made for a particular product on a particular

Could you rephrase your question in terms of example markup
and client-server interactions?

Off the top of my head, this seems like a resonable usage:

	See <A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt"
		URN="URN:EITF:rfc/822>The Format for Internet
		Messages</a> for more info.

Clients that grok URNs can use the URN attribute, and other clients
can use the ftp: address.

This still strikes me as something of a hack, but it's a reasonable
hack in the near term.

Dave Raggett, Tim Berners-Lee and I discussed the META element
for a while. I don't like the idea. Tim didn't either, and
Dave Raggett eventually agreed that there might be better
ways to express these sentiments.

What is the meaning of the META element? I've heard several
things:

Proposal: It's for http headers:
	<META name="Expires" value="Tue Aug 12, 1994 10:33:32 CST">
Answer: Then why not write:
	<HTTP-HEADER name="Expires" ...>

and what happens when some dork writes:
	<HTTP-HEADER name="User-Agent" value="bogus">

I can see the need for:

	<EXPIRES DATE="...">

but not a general HTTP header escape mechanism.

Proposal II: It's for private indexing techniques. Then why not
	use comments or processing instructions?
	<?keywords a,b,c,d>
	<?description lksjdflkjsdf>
or
	<!-- @#@# KEYWORDS: a,b,c -->
	<!-- @#@# DESCRIPTION: ... -->

As long as these techniques are private to one implementation, this
is all you need. If you get to the point where you expect other
folks to understand the meaning of these idioms, just propose
new tags:
	<KEYWORDS>a,b,c,</keywords>
	<description>lkjsdlfkjsldf... </description>

And about indexing... anybody who's interested in these problems should
probably try to follow the discussions about URC's on the
uri-request@bunyip.com mailing list.

Also, at WWW '94, it was suggested that the TEI header might be a workable
technology to use in this area.


If you're gonna hack, go ahead and hack. If you're trying to get it
right, make sure you've done your homework. But don't hack and pretend
you're getting it right :-)

Well, if you do that and your browser doesn't understand these tags
the text in between ends up in your document, which is not where
you want it. At least with <META ...> that doesn't happen.

So you're saying current browsers are broken. So what's new?
We can decide (a) we need to fix them, or (b) we can never
have non-empty elements in the HEAD.

I was working under assumption (a). If you choose (b), you
can still write:

	<KEYWORDS words="a,b,c">
	<description text="alsdkfjlkj sldfkj sldf">

*ARGH*  The need for this element should be obvious from prior www-talk
discussions and from my paper at WWW94, but here we go again:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--
 The META element can be used to embed document metainformation not
 defined by other HTML+ elements for use by servers/clients capable
 of extracting that information.

 Servers should read the document head to generate HTTP headers
 corresponding to any META elements with the HEADER attribute,
 e.g. if the document contains:

     <meta header name="Expires" value="Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT">

 The server should include the header:

     Expires: Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT

 as part of the HTTP response to a GET or HEAD request for that document.
 When the HEADER attribute is not present, the server should not generate
 an HTTP header for this metainformation; e.g.

     <meta name="IndexType" value="Service">

 would not generate an HTTP header but would still allow clients or
 other tools to make use of that metainformation.

 Other likely names are "Keywords", "Created", "Owner" (a name)
 and "Reply-To" (an email address).  
-->

<!ELEMENT META - O EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST META
        id      ID      #IMPLIED -- to allow meta info                  --
        header (header) #IMPLIED -- generate HTTP header                --
        name    CDATA   #IMPLIED -- metainformation name e.g. "Expires" --
        value   CDATA   #IMPLIED -- associated value                    -->

Because metainformation may or may not also be useful as header information,
depending on the capabilities of a given server and the existence of
future tools which make use of that information.  Nevertheless, it is still
metainformation whether or not it is used within response headers.

> and what happens when some dork writes:
> 	<HTTP-HEADER name="User-Agent" value="bogus">

Not a damn thing, as User-Agent is not a valid RESPONSE header.  Furthermore,
how the server decides what is and what is not a legal name for a header 
is left to the server implementation -- the META element only provides a means
for document authors to include that information within the document head.
In other words, it could easily ignore any META headers named "Date" or
"Last-modified".

> I can see the need for:

But can you anticipate the needs of everyone?  My original proposal called
for an EXPIRES element like the above and an OWNER element like

        <OWNER name="...">

It was shot down because it does not satisfy the general need for document
metainformation which can be parsed without pre-knowledge of the purpose of
that metainformation.  To take an example from an earlier discussion:

        <META name="IAFA-Template" value="document">

would be useful for automated tools that build IAFA indices.

> or

Because it is not for PRIVATE indexing techniques.  There is a multitude
of uses for this information, most of which I did not think of when the
META element was originally proposed.

Love to, but HTML lacks any ability to add new elements which
contain content without breaking compatibility with existing browsers. 
Thus, including the above in any existing document will result in the line 

a,b,c,lkjsdlfkjsldf... 

appearing at the top of the display.

Is that a person or a mail robot?  It did not respond to my request yesterday.
Is that discussion archived on the web?

It was?  Could you elaborate?  WWW94 would have been a lot more useful
if the workshops did not compete with the speakers.  For example, I believe
all of you (i.e. Tim, Dave, and Dan) were off talking about development
futures during the presentations about indexing (Thursday morning).
Had you been more involved in the general conference, I think the panel
on future developments would have been broader in scope.

The META element is not a hack.  It was proposed 6 months ago as a valid
addition to HTML+ (now HTML 3.0).  The "header" attribute was added two
months ago when it became clear that not all metainfo is desirable as
headers.  It was designed to provide a useful function within the limits
imposed by the hack we call HTML (which, by any measure, is a damn good hack).

Even if we were to completely re-engineer HTML 3.0 so that it could contain
arbitrary SGML and be able to define new elements on the fly (which can be
correctly parsed by all HTML 3.0 clients rather than simply ignored), there
would still be a need for general META elements so that tools (e.g. MOMspider)
could find that information without having to hard-code its name within the
tool itself.

Good. Examples. I love examples. As a counterexample, consider:

	<EXPIRES DATE="Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT">

How would they make use of that information? Unless and until there's
a public agreement about what such data represents, you're talking
about private techniques. When such general consensus is reached,
then we add it to the spec. No?


> Other likely names are "Keywords", "Created", "Owner" (a name)

Yes... all these belong in the <HEAD>...</HEAD> of an HTML document.
The HEAD is by design isomorphic to the HTTP headers, or the headers
of a mail message or a news article. You don't need an extra META
element to say this.

I would still like to see a definition of this term "metainformation."
You might say that the TITLE of a document is metainformation. You
might say ADDRESS is metainformation. But I don't see how this distinction
is useful.

No, and I'm not trying to. New elements can and will be added over
time.

I find that original proposal quite on target, and I don't see how
the counterargument carries much weight. What examples motivate
this "general need for document metainformation" that are not
satisfied by new HEAD elements?

This is news to me. What is this public agreement about how these
indexing techniques work? I can imagine some sort of relational
database abstraction behind it all or something... hmmm...

In how many cases is this information exchanged between parties, vs.
the number of cases when it is only used privately by one party?

Sad but largely true: HTML is defined by the behaviour
of Mosaic. The HEAD element has long been documented as info
that doesn't go in the text flow with the body elements, but
the Mosaic code doesn't make any distinction between HEAD
and BODY.

Ok, fine... so make all the new elements empty. Or just fix Mosaic. :-)

Stu Wiebel from OCLC said he'd been looking at the TEI header
as a URC mechanism. Several other folks nodded and grunted.
I haven't looked closely at the TEI stuff yet, so I can't
say much more...

>The META element is not a hack.

I disagree.

I moved my discussion of the META element to the www-html list since
it seemed like the appropriate thing to do.  I am beginning to wonder
about the utility of splitting this list -- it seems to me that WWW
and HTML are inseparable and changes to HTML cannot be made without
effecting all WWW developers.  The same can be said of HTTP.
Am I alone in this view?

In fact, I think it would be a better idea to just change the list name
to "www-developers" and thus make it easier for newbees to see that we
aren't talking about "how to use" issues.

Below is a replacement LineMode/Implementation/DefaultStyles.c that is a
little bit more "friendly" looking (at least to my eyes).  Maybe you'll
like it better also, maybe not.

I would really like to do some more hacking on the output but alas, I
haven't the time right now.  Just in case anyone is interested, here are
a couple of suggestions for formatting the output a little nicer still:

Headers could look something like this:

HEADER LEVEL1
=============

Header Level2
-------------

Header Level3

And lists should have bullets:
    Some text leading into the paragraph
      * Item1
      * Item2, this item is
	very long
      * Item3
    More text in next para.

Put me down in favour of the current META element proposal.  I know of at
least one project where its use is almost certain (the alternative being
comments which I consider to be a *real* hack).  Its a great way to play
with indexing engines and put out new headers without hacking all the servers
to bits.  It gets my vote.

As suggested at the WWW '94 Conference, we have now set up the
www-proxy mailing list.  This list is meant for *technical* discussion
about WWW proxies, caching, and future directions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TO SUBSCRIBE, send mail to:

	www-proxy-request@info.cern.ch

and in the message body write:

	subscribe www-proxy Your Name

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TO UNSUBSCRIBE, again, send mail to www-proxy-request@info.cern.ch, saying:

	unsubscribe www-proxy

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The list address itself is:

	www-proxy@info.cern.ch

Mail sent there will be distributed to all subscribers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNDERSTAND THIS:
 - *NEVER* send un/subscriptions to the list itself!!!  To unsubscribe
   from any list blaa@foo.bar, send mail to blaa-request@foo.bar
 - always read all the messages from the list *before* replying to any
   of them -- this way the same question won't be answered many times
   and noise-level goes down
 - let's keep the discussion strictly technical; have flame wars
   somewhere else

----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't know what a WWW proxy is, read our proxy paper:

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proxies/

This kind of thing shouldn't go into the HTML. Instead you need a better
utility for converting to Postscript. In the longer term, style sheets
will carry this info for specified page sizes etc.

Is anyone working on an improved Postscript filter?

Can anyone email me with info on indexing requirements for HTML
and other document types? I am interested in what kinds of info
people will need to index documents and what should then be picked
up by HTTP servers and placed into the HTTP header.

The current META element is perhaps too open ended ...

My example would be more like this:

See <A URN="URN:IANA:IETF:rfc/822"> The Format for Internet Messages</A>
for more information.

Then the client would take the URN and hand it off to its favorite
URC server and get back a set of URLs (how we represent a set of 
choices to the user is another question) which the user can select or
have the client select. Then the client would take the selected URL
and do it's normal operations on it.

I guess my question would be more along the lines of: is the HREF
in your example required or optional?

According to the DTD, HREF is optional -- mostly because there's
no way to express in SGML the sentiment "either the NAME attribute
or the HREF attribute must be present."

>From the HTML spec:
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/A.html
All attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary
for the anchor to be useful. 

It's reasonable to change that to say:

All attributes are optional, although one of NAME, HREF, or URN is necessary
for the anchor to be useful.

Whereas in the near term, an A tag with a URN attribute
but no HREF attribute is useless to most of the community,
I suggest that you use the URN for the lasting name, but for the
benefit of existing clients, you include a redundant
HREF.

Actually, now that I think about it, If you're not going to include
a redundant URL, why don't you just write:

	<A HREF="URN:IANA:IETF:rfc/822"> ...</a>

???

This would work also. I would like to be able to make this distinction
in HTML though. Simply to keep in the spirit. There also seems to be
something in HTParse.c that is causing that example URN to be invalid
since HTParse.c: scan() function makes the assumption (which may be
a correct one according to the current URL spec) that no other colon
should exist beyond the first one. This is causing HTParse() to turn
the above into "URN:rfc/822" by basically looking at the first colon
READING BACKWARDS.

Is this correct?

Well... it depends on how you want to look at it. The URI working
group's definition of URL is
	scheme:anything

The WWW definition of URI (the contents of the HREF attribute) is:
	scheme://hostport/dir1/dir2;param=value?search#fragment
where all the parts are optional, but only certain combinations
make sense. (See
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/URI_Overview.html
for details)

So any WWW URI is an IETF URL, but the converse isn't true.
HTParse.c assumes you're handing it a URI.

Now if you define the syntax of URN to be:
	URN:anything
then any URN is a URL, but it's not a URI.

It would make more sense to me to define the syntax of URNs
such thaty they are also URIs. So in stead of:

 	HREF="URN:IANA:IETF:rfc/822"
you would write:
 	HREF="URN://IETF.IANA/rfc/822"


It's just an expedient measure to hasten deployment. The syntaxes
have equivalent expressive power.

Well, I have just put it in and showed it to Tim...

Hmmm I guess that what I have learned is that taste is difficult to discuss  
:-(

I think the solution is to put in a new command line option saying 


	- userinterface <classic> | <modern>
	
Now, I know somebody will reply - why not

	- userinterface non-existant

but then I will just start to talk about the unknown powers of the Line Mode  
Browser ;-)

Thanks!  I wasn't expecting anything but I'm glad to hear you are
willing to tweak it.  Please send me the patches if you don't mind.

> I think the solution is to put in a new command line option saying 
> 	- userinterface <classic> | <modern>
Or as one person suggested to me in private mail, you could write a
textual version of the style information and parse it in.  So then
you would have:
	-style {classic|modern|gobblefork}
Which would simply point to files (perhaps defaulting to a standard location
and perhaps having a WWW_STYLE_PATH, etc etc).  And then users could easily
edit the style to their taste.

And *THEN* we could start putting these in our documents:
	<LINK REV="WWWStyle" HREF="...">
and the WWW linemode browser could load that specific style for that
specific document (allowing for the user to override them of course).
And then you could write a style editor, and then we could standardize
it, and then... Oopps, sorry, I got a little carried away.

Just making headers and lists a little prettier will make me happy :-)

Yes: we need to be able to express more machine-readable semantic
information in documents, but NO, I don't think META is the
way to do it.

A semantic network represented by typed links is the mechanism
I see emerging. Using HyTime markup, we might write:

	<ilink linkends="billgates microsoft" anchroles="officer corporation">
	<urlloc id=billgates>public-figure:/Gates/William</urlloc>
	<urlloc id=microsoft>corporation:/USA/Microsoft</urlloc>

Ok, I've added a couple of lines to HTParse.c that fix this and a few
other things that the current URL spec breaks:

in scan() I added these two lines just before the line 
after_access = name;:

    if(!strncmp(name,"URL:",4))
        name=name+4;

This takes care of the current URL spec that requires URL: in front of
a URL. Normal WWW URLs still work normally.

Next, in that first for loop that scans for scheme I added a 'break;'
as illustrated:

for(p=name; *p; p++) {
        if (*p==':') {
                *p = 0;
                parts->access = name;   /* Access name has been specified */
                after_access = p+1;
!!!!here----->  break;   <-------here!!!!
        }
        if (*p=='/') break;
        if (*p=='#') break;
    }

This fixes the apparent small bug that causes URN:bla:bla: to get fouled up.
Everything else seems to work normally.

Can anyone see anything wrong with these two changes?

I don't think that's a very good idea. Now you've got a piece of

Blech. Hack. Barf. Who writes HREF="URL:..."? Why?

Why is this a bug? That code is written to the URI spec, and per
the URI spec, URN:blah:blah: is garbage.

Change the URN syntax, not the HTParse() code.

Hmm.  I'm already doing that kind of tagging -- creating links to
background documents and such, using URLs.  I'm interested in creating tags
that *aren't* links, for the kinds of purposes that META is also intended
for -- automatic creation of new indexes, etc.  In other words, not
anchors, just semantic tags.

This would allow, for example, an investment company to have a proprietary
file on Microsoft (don't we all?) that's automatically linked to incoming
tagged news articles.  More important, the system that processes incoming
articles could see that a company is mentioned for which there is no
backgrounder, which would trigger a search of public sources.

But then again, I've never delved into HyTime in any depth at all, so maybe
I'm misunderstanding what's going on in your example.

In any event, I *really* would like to see explicit support for this sort
of thing in HTML.  Headers are a good place to start, though, so perhaps we
shouldn't go too far with this discussion until the original issue
regarding META reaches some resolution.

BTW, one of the things I might stick into META elements would be lists of
all of the companies mentioned in an article, all of the people, all of the
products, all of the fizzbins, etc.  Getting that sort of information --
the names of the META elements and the lists of items in them -- in
response to the HEAD request would be of great benefit to navigation
automation.

(Have you seen Topic from Verity? It's a nice engine for doing
just this sort of thing... it's natural-language based.)

Why? It seems like a separate data format might work better for
your app. A client could get and display the HTML, but it could
also ask for the document in application/x-people-places-things form,
(be sure to check with Apple before using that name... :-)
which might look like:

	(PERSONS (GATES WILLIAM)
		(CLINTON WILLIAM)
		)
	(CORPORATIONS MICROSOFT)
	(COUNTRIES USA)

I can imagine a set of navigation mechanisms based on this sort
of information. I don't see that HTML is the most convenient
representation of the information, though.

If you've got a specific way to attack the resource discovery problem
with these semantic tags, I'd be very interested.

But if you just want a general mechanism to express machine-readable
semantic information, you're barking up a non-existent tree. From
what I've learned from the knowledge-representation researchers,
the best way to exchange arbitrary semantic information between
domains is to write it out in the natural language. Then the
domain-specific parser extracts the parts it's interested in.

Oh, yes, indeed I have.  I'm familiar with the commercial products that do
things like this.  In fact, a lot of my ideas and strategies have come out
of kicking around ideas with some people who were involved in its creation.
One of my best friends from high school, many ages ago, manages the
Minerva project at Booz-Allen & Hamilton, which bought ADS, the company
from which Verity spun out.

But the whole idea is to use the Web as a communications mechanism.  I
don't particularly want to be off on my own island.

Heck, no, but the Web's momentum is hard to ignore.  I'm really happy to
work in an environment in which dozens of people and companies are trying
to build the best servers and browsers.  I don't think there is anything
similar.

>If you've got a specific way to attack the resource discovery problem

I do, but it's still in the idea and prototype stage.  And I'm not ready to
share it in public, except to say that it's collaborative.  And uses an
organic model.

Ugh.  Although I'll admit that that's true, there are some promising lines
of research into things such as merging pre-existing taxonomies into
semantic networks and such.

But where I'm really headed is the creation of an environment in which many
natural language processors, er, I mean people, are involved in creation
and maintenance of a web of information.  That oversimplifies radically,
though.  But it's why the Web and HTML are critical -- they're the means to
allow really large numbers of people to participate.  Check out my essay,
<a href="http"//198.92.133.3/mendicants.html">Mendicant Sysops in
CyberSpace</a> for a bit of the philosophy behind this.

Perhaps a concrete example will help.  My main practical project right now
is establishment of a net-based library for Sarajevo.  Its creation and
maintenance will involve ex-Yugoslavians who are scattered all over the
world, thanks to the diaspora.  I'm prototyping tools that will allow these
people to collaborate on structuring and maintaining a set of information
resources that reflects their collective points of view.  One of the areas
in which they'll collaborate is in determining how the documents in the
library are tagged for various purposes.

I should emphasize that I don't expect people to collaborate as one big
homogenized group, but as many subcommunities whose work as a whole is
interconnected.  Nor do I expect that more than 5-10 percent of the library
"members" will get involved in the collaborative process.  But when you're
talking about reaching thousands of people, even if only a few percent get
involved, that's a lot of "natural language processing" power.

Bill Gates talks about "Information at Your Fingertips."  I think that "A
Librarian at Your Fingertips" is much more interesting.  Not that I think
Bill doesn't understand...

A WWW URI will work exactly as before. It doesn't change anything except for
testing to see if it's a URL with the required 'URL:' pre-prefix. 

Is there ever to be a reconciliation between WWW URIs and IETF URIs?

According to the current IETF URL draft a URL should be prefixed by
a 4 characters identifier so you know you have a URL as opposed to a 
URN or LIFN or whatever.

Why is URN:bla:bla:bla garbage? It fits the WWW definition of 
scheme:path just fine. The only small problem is that, according to the
BNF, _path_ is an xpalpha which cannot include ':' since ':' is part of
reserved. ':' is also the only element of reserved that is not used 
anywhere else. I _could_ escape the other colons but I would rather not.

I know of no URL that will break if that small change is made. I know that
in itself not a good enough reason to do it but if it makes WWW and the
current IETF proposals compliant then it buys us something, right?

> Change the URN syntax, not the HTParse() code.

I'm trying to make sure that it won't matter either way.

Ok, so this is a small issue. In effect, you've stolen URL: from
the scheme namespace. Aside from the fact that there's not reason
to do this, it's pretty harmless.

>Is there ever to be a reconciliation between WWW URIs and IETF URIs?

Neither has an architecture that is compelling just by its
elegance and simplicity, but WWW has an installed base of
about 2million, last I heard. I have seen _no_ motivation
for many of the syntactic features in the IETF URI papers.

Two things convince me: (1) a formal argument, or (2) time.
The WWW stuff has some time behind it. The URL: noise
has neither.

Why do you need to distinguish between URLs, URNs, LIFNs, etc?
Why not just use the one big happy address space that's
currently deployed? When you discover new ways to resolve
addresses (be they protocol-independent, location independent,
or whatever), you just make up a new scheme, and away you go!

My question remains unanswered.

In a WWW URI, hierarchical names are separated by /. This is a
convention with about 4 years behind it.  If you're going
to use the WWW architecture to deploy URNs, why not stick with that
convention and write
	URN:/blah/blah/blah

I believe you're unnecessarily complicating matters. If this
URN:blah:blah syntax is deployed, folks will have to deal with two
syntaxes for the same features. It's not the end of the world,
but it's a pain in the ass for no reason.

I didn't say anything about not using the Web. I just said you might
not want to use HTML. Lots of apps in the Web use GIF for images.
Because data is not represented in HTML hardly means it's not accessible
through the web.

Great! When you get this thing ready for general use, I'd like
to use it to moderate the revision of the HTML spec!

Seriously... we are badly in need of a collaborative knowledge-base
editing tool. But it's a hard problem. I expect that building a tool
that works for the knowledge domain you're talking about _or_ the
knowledge domain I'm talking about is doable in the near term.

Building one that works for arbitrary knowledge domains isn't likely
to happen without a LOT of work.

That's why I see this semantic tagging stuff as an application-specific
need, and not something we need to be able to do within HTML.

I agree.  Although at some sufficient level of abstraction WWW and HTML are 
separate topics, the two are so tightly intertwined (IMHO) that it is 
worthless for me to even bother to try personally archiving HTML messages 
separately from WWW messages -- they are all dumped in the same folder (MS 
Mail :)).  If HTML use on the Web drops to only a small percentage of total 
Web use, I for one will reconsider the split idea.

Perhaps we aren't all looking at the value of the Web in the same way.  I
don't think that semantic tagging is an application-specific capability; it
appears to be to be utterly essential to the Web's scalability.  If it's
not enabled, it's going to be very hard to find things.

Without the possibility of semantic tagging, there's no way to automate the
linking of Web documents in ways that take advantage of its capabilities.
We'll be stuck with the old flat-file and relational models (which have
already reared their ugly heads in this discussion) that have limited value
in this environment.  They have their place, but unless they're storing
semantically related information, they'll have a hard time coping with the
scale of information-sharing that's becoming possible.

I'm bothered by the introduction of the relational model into this
discussion.  It's much too limiting.  The relational model doesn't work for
a few reasons.   In a relational model, the number of sets of objects is
basically fixed when the database is created.  You can't easily add
infinite new "columns."  As I suggested earlier, in a semantic structure,
you can add "fizzbins" any time.

The second big problem is tht in the relational model, there's no way to
express an object that inherits characteristics of two parents.  For
example, if you have manufacturing companies and service companies as one
way of categorizing, and public companies v. private companies as another,
the relational model has no way to express the full set of relationships.
You have to express it as manufaturing companies that are public or private
and service companies that are public or private, or the other way around,
but not all of the relationships.

Talking about lists and help - is it just me, or is list-proc doubling

Agreed... complex documents (documents built in a recrusive tree
structure) such as HTML documents cannot be intuitively represented in
RDBs...we need semantic-type data models. 

Unfortunately databases constructed according to these kinds of data models
tend to be filled with cross references and links....in fact so many of
them that they *could* be very difficult to maintain manually.
Therefore, if we are interested in data integrity, we need to consider
building some kind of a database level (like HAM) into the web. Such a
database level would accept and serve document objects and maintain the
integrity of the links between them.
While I suspect that tables would be easier to manage manually, they are
not rich enough for the kind of document we are interested in.

Lets face it, data integrity is a big problem at the moment (links to
non-existent documents, etc), and it is a problem that can only worsen.

With all this talk of collaboration, complex semantic relationships etc. it
look like we are moving towards consideration of a layered hypertext
architecture. Development of such an architecture would probably prove to
be one of the most challenging internet development programs ever.
However, I reckon it is worth considering :-)

Just musing :-)

Here MIME headers get doubled as well, and yes, I'm using MH too. But my

Hi!

I can't use the compose key in Mosaic input fields.
If you know why, please write it to me.

I use NCSA Mosaic on SUN Solaris 2.3, and would like

3.0 Prerelease 6
 
     * Distribution now contains the ICE indexing package by Christian
       Neuss.
     * DirAddHref directive by Guenther Fisher.
     * Fixed the SIGPIPE bug with POST which caused CGI scripts to exit
       prematurely without a reason.
     * Fixed the bug that prevented uid and gid from being set correctly
       when they were specified in the inlined protection setup (external
       file worked fine).
     * Fixed the stupid problem with gc_info file not being initialized
       with certain gc's.
     * SCO support by Brian King (thank you!).
     * A-umlaut problem with FTP README files fixed.
     * Fixed the bug with conditional GET from the client causing a
       closed connection when there was no cache file on the proxy for it
       and the remote server sent "Not modified".
     * Fixed the bug with proxy URL re-escaping when the original
       hostname was in upper-case.
     * ~ and : are no longer escaped in automatic redirections.
     * Fixed the bug that httpd would try to bind to port in -gc_only
       mode.
     * ParentUserId and ParentGroupId to set the uid and gid of the
       parent process right after binding to port (some people complained
       that setuid() is slow on certain systems).
       If CacheLastModifiedFactor is Off then CacheDefaultExpiry is used
       instead of zero LM factor.

Hello All.

I have been asked to look into the hardware required for running a WWW
server for our campus. We hope to provide a reasonably large selection
of information to audiences both internal and external to our college.
We would probably require sound and a reasonable amount of space for
development. There is a reasonable chance the machine will also be used for
other applications, eg Usenet NEWS. I am looking at a Unix machine.

Would it be possible for other people who have experience of this to share
some of the ideas on the kind of hardware required? In particular:
Machine type, disk space and RAM. I have already had some good ideas
from various sources about using a SUN machine (well, the person concerned
would say that as he works there 8-) ), which I am inclined to follow. I
am considering a SUN IPX with 32 Meg of RAM and up to 2 Gb disc space. Would
this suffice/be overkill?

All thoughts and comments appreciated.
ThanX in advance,

Richard Hughes

Does anyone know the details of installing Mosaic on a PC that does not
have network connection ?  (This may seem bizarre but it is necessary to
read HTML docs produced.)

As I understood, nullsock.dll is necessary in the windows/system dir.  
This however has not stopped the windows messages "Call to undefined dynalink"
on various occasions.

Worse still is the win32 version which shuts windows good and proper on exit.

Any help available ?

For what it's worth, we're looking at an organic model with cellular
structures.  Layering would be derived from it, rather than being the
structural basis.  An organic model seems necessary to limit the level of
complexity apparent to users.  Actually, it's a web of hierachies from
which larger hierarchies are derived.  An ant farm... or a beehive.  ;-)

If you need to hack today, i.e. you have some application where it's
easier to hack the documents to tell your converter where to put page
breaks than it is to fix the converter to "do it right," I'd suggest
writing:

	<? pagebreak>

or
	&pagebreak;

The <? pagebreak> thingy is a "processing instruction." It's a kind of
SGML escape mechanism. It's almost like a comment, except that it _is_
part of the ESIS, that is, the parsed representation of a document.

The &pagebreak; thingy is an entity reference. It presupposes that
somewhere in the prologue (DTD), somebody has written:

	<!ENTITY pagebreak SDATA [pagebreak]>
or
	<!ENTITY pagebreak "<? pagebreak>">
or
	<!ENTITY pagebreak "<pagebreak>">

The handy thing about the &pagebreak; form is that it works like a
macro that you can later redefine without editing your documents. For
example, suppose folks had been writing &br; all along in stead of
<br>.  And suppose the first version of the HTML DTD that defined br
defined it thusly:

	<!ENTITY br "<? linebreak>">

because we believed linebreaks had no structural significance. Then,
we decide after a while that in fact they do have structural
significance -- the parts of a postal address, for example, are split
into separate lines to distinguish street address from city and state,
etc. Then we could revise the DTD to read:

	<!ENTITY br "<br>">

and presto! without changing the documents, they all benefit from this
change. (Some documents would potentially become invalid, since
<?linebreak> is allowed anywhere, and <br> might only be allowed in
certain places).

On the practical side, I think you can choose either form of markup
and get the results you're after -- namely, that it doesn't show up on
the screen when you preview it with Mosaic. Quick check... Crud.
Mosaic displays &pagebreak; and <?pagebreak>.

So much for that idea!

Oh well... there's always the old comment hack
	<!-- pagebreak -->

Our campus info server used to be an IPX and it could easily handle the
(then) gopher based CWIS, 40-50 simulataneous browser logins and some
(then) experimental http deamons.  We now use a Sparc10/52 as the info
server and this supports both gopher and HTTP CWIS interfaces, a second
HTTP server for an electronic journals project, some WAIS databases, loads
of interactive line mode browser logins, a few shell users and a whole
heap of network gateways and bits and bobs.  I'd say that the IPX should
give you plenty of oompf and a bit of headroom.  If you run SunOS4.1.3
instead of that nasty Solaris 2.x you'll find things might be a bit
faster (and certainly a damn sight easier to manage :-) ), but that's upto
you.  A big advantage of using Suns is that they are usually one of the
platforms that alot of PD software is developed on and so things tend to
be easier to port than some of the more esoteric UNIX platforms.

But it sounds like such a good idea -- what are the chances of having 
that implemented and put into the HTML spec?  (I.e., that <? ...> and 
&... forms are not displayed by browsers.)  It seems very useful, 
along with being proper SGML.

	I'll get over it.  I'm in a state (again; this happens to me 
a lot) where this thing is intuitively obvious to me,  and I feel 
strongly that it's right,  but I lack the formal argument which would 
persuade you (or at least the HTTP spec editor).

	Likewise, of course.   ;-) 
 
	I'd like to know if there's some forum other than  www-talk 
where this can be properly hammered out.   Then,  hopefully,  HTTP 
will follow that common lead.  (as will,  hopefully,  whatever else 
new and wonderful comes up,  maybe even  son-of-SMTP)   But where?

	IP ties together a community of machines have radically 
different local representations of  "plain text",  floating point, 
integer,  sound,  image,  etc.   You mentioned EBCDIC.   I have a whole 
raft of logs that confirm that HTML is regularly stored and processed 
in EBCDIC  (though sent on the wire as ASCII,  because that's what we 
agreed to in the community).   There's also that weird charset that 
CDC used for the Cyber.   Dunno if it's still alive.   If so, 
then it's just as viable for representation for HTML as ASCII, 
but we speak ASCII "on the wire".

	Right.   And I say that  "plain text on the wire" 
is  "ASCII, delimited by CR+LF".   I think you agree,  right? 
But we try to make our servers  "liberal about what they accept" 
by making the CR optional.   Fine.   I say,  take that one step 
further and make trailing white space insignificant.   If you 
accept the former,  how do you justify rejecting the latter?

Here's my view:

The DTD will have a declaration:
	<!ENTITY #DEFAULT SDATA "&#38;unkown;" --display the markup-->

which says (in SGML) that arbitrary entity references are legal and
(in application conventions) that if you see an entity that you don't
recognize, just display the markup. So you might see:

	When &alpha; > &beta;, it is clear that...

So in the future, &pagebreak; won't be silently ignored -- it'll
either be handled in some way specified by the DTD, or it'll be displayed
as &pagebreak;.

On the other hand, <? pagebreak> should _not_ be displayed. The fact
that Mosaic fails to recognize this as markup is just a plain old bug.

The question of how to manage the namespace of processing instructions
remains. I suggest we don't manage it at all -- we leave it wide open
for private mechanisms (text formatting systems, index generators, and
the like). This leaves the possibility that private mechanisms will
clash, but ...

I am suggesting we accept neither missing CR nor trailing whitespace.
Just fix the broken code.

If you want to hack in code in your servers that accepts missing CR,
and throws away whitespace at the end of a line, go right ahead.

I really wish you wouldn't though, as many developers use the "it
works with server X, so it must be right" methodology. So we will have
broken clients that work with hacked servers, and so new servers will
have to support the broken clients, and the spec documents will get
cluttered up with "NOTE: you really should add this hack and this
kludge if you want to interoperate with 80% of the existing
implementations."

I say: be precise, strict, and exact, in all distributed computations.

Suppose, in the future, we want to be able to take the md5 checksum of
the HTTP headers. If you corrupt the bytes by throwing away whitespace
at the end of a line, you defeat such efforts.

HTTP is currently based on a reliable 8-bit transport (TCP, not just
IP). Let's keep it that way.

	Thank's for being consistent.

	You can't do that in a truly heterogeneous world (or network). 
I'm not saying it's right to be imprecise, lax, or inexact, but that's 
what you're going to run into.   Be a boy scout,  "Be Prepared".

	You're saying that HTTP is  -not-  a plain text protocol. 
 
	If it's not a plain text protocol,  then GET should have been 
something like  (in C): 
 
		sprintf(GET_REQUEST,"%c%s",0x01,URL) 
 
	where 0x01 is just some arbitrary bit pattern that we chose 
to mean  "GET".   But it's not.   Blame this on Tim if you don't like it. 
Going with a plain text protocol made HTTP  1)  easier to debug,  and 
2)  easier to extend.   The same is true for ignoring trailing white 
space.   (optional CR is just a courtesy we give to UNIX,  I s'pose) 
 
> HTTP is currently based on a reliable 8-bit transport 
> (TCP, not just IP). Let's keep it that way. 
 
	TELNET is currently based on a reliable 8-bit transport, 
but you don't expect your shell to be as strict as you seem to want 
HTTP to be.   HTTPD's not a shell?   Sure it is.   "Shells take their 
input from humans only",  not true! 
 
> Dan 
 
	BTW,  all I'm suggesting is that we retain (formally) 
one aspect of current behaviour.   The servers I've been able 
to check don't care about trailing white space;  some even allow 
the blank line (end-of-header) to be just blank (not empty) already. 
Let's keep it that way.

What is a "plain text protocol"?  If you answer, please be very, very 
precise.

HTTP depends on reliable, 8-bit transport.  The fact that HTTP has byte 
sequences that spell out English words has no implication on other aspects 
of the protocol.

The security extensions have been designed specifically to ensure that headers
can be MD5'd. A signed header consists of two parts, one that is signed and
another that is unsigned. So a gateway must preserve absolutely the signed
parts but can add in extra bits into the unsigned portion (eg going through
a gateway).

is running on info.cern.ch:

	http://info.cern.ch/wit

Read more about it in the WIT; and USE THE WIT to discuss it, don't

Bare in mind that this was put together in a big hurry in a few days
so forgive me if it doesn't do yet all the things that it could do.

Have fun WIT'ting around!

Whoah.. who woulda thought you could get flamed for quoting Dave Raggett..
I mean _that_ Dave Raggett folks! :-))

But then, it was on march 16 when he suggested "META" for storing meta
information on HTML documents:
> Before you start inventing new elements, consider the HTML+ META
> element. This was added as a general solution to adding meta
> information to HTML documents. This scheme allows wobots to scan
> this information efficiently using the HTTP HEAD method.
and now it's already june.. I guess that the WWW world just moves
pretty fast. However, IMVHO Jens' question deserves an answer, and
since Mr. Connolly seems to be more competent in this area, perhaps
he could elaborate on the One True Way Of Adding Meta Information.
;-)

Seriously, this is important. The only way to actually get people
to add such information (which is necessary for all kinds of local
and global indexes) is have editors provide a special field for
filling it in. But this requires that a standard has to be agreed
on by the time real WYSIWYG editing tools arrive - and this is
gonna be pretty soon... :-)))

Now where's that asbestos suit...

For the record the SGML handbook gives an example of using <!ENTITY> to
define processing instructions with the PI keyword, see page 41 - B.6.2.1

        <!ENTITY page PI "newpage; space = 3">

The keyword PI indicates that the entity will be interpreted as a
processing instruction when referenced! This provides a clean way of
abbreviating longer processing instructions which would normally
be defined with the <? ...> mechanism.

H ave been sent requests to summarise the information received following
my request for help. This I will do, probably at the end of the week so I
can correlate any info gained. Thanks for the flow of information received

I have listened to the recent discussion about meta information with interest. 
It reminds me of the discussions about meta information that happened in the 
scientific datasets community some years ago. As looks like happening here, the 
proponents of 'we don't need no meta information' won. So, apart from some 
notable exceptions, such as the NASA work on PDS, scientific datasets don't have 
proper meta information, there are no real standards worth a damn, and 
visualisation systems throw any meta information away. Ho hum.

But discussions of the best, truest and most holy way to alter the DTD to 
express this or that have seemed a little closed and high flying. Yes some 
people know enough to suggest an addition to the DTD when they want to add a 
meta information element - but the vast and increasing majority don't. Many 
information providers will not even know the DTD exists; just that they use a 
special Web editor to write Web pages. The implementation details are as 
irrelevant as they are to the user of a wordprocessor, or a paint package.

Similarly, I have little sympathy for the idea that all meta elements are left 
open ended and un-specified, as if each information provider should be capable 
of designing their own, well specified, incompatible, system. That may be true 
of some people - perhaps many of those on this list - but we are not a 
representative selection. Once good authoring tools come into play, we will be a 
massively un-representative selection!

I would much rather see a suitable selection of generally usefull elements which 
will, inevitably, be adopted as a defacto standard in the absence of anything 
else. 

Then they will get used, acquire critical mass, and become useful. 

At WWW94 I suggested to Dave Raggett that the meta elements be firmed up a 
little so that there was a usable set for commonly required ones, and a simple 
procedure for registering new ones. That way, the system is extensible and 
useable. The WYSIWYG editors just incorporate the latest crop of registered 
extensions each time a new minor version comes out.

If new elements are registered this avoids duplication, which is I think self 
evidently a good thing. If some elements are standardised they will get used, 
which is also clearly of benefit, and if a significant proportion of the web 
documents out there have some, usable, meta information - all using the same set 
of tags, not all different ones - we have a big win.

I have developed a somewhat similar facility, in this case,
designed to allow students and staff here to annotate 
problem sets and course notes.  The working prototype is

http://willow.tc.cornell.edu/Annotated/cs212_ps4

The current design requires you to "log in" to read anything.
You can use any name you like (but won't be able to add
annotations) or you pretend to be a CS212 student, in which
case use "cs212" as your password.

Feedback appreciated.

Subject: Meta information
content-length: 1082

I followed the discussion in March about meta information. The German
Etext project needs TODAY a way to include meta information for indexing.
So I went the proagmatic way and included the following in each header:

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Rotkaeppchen</TITLE>

<META name="BOOKTITLE" value="Reclams Maerchenbuch">
<META name="TITLE"     value="Rotkaeppchen">
<META name="YEAR"      value="1990">
<META name="PUBLISHER" value="Philipp Reclam jun. GmbH & Co.">
<META name="ADDRESS"   value="Stuttgart">
<META name="AUTHOR"    value="Gebrueder Grimm">
<META name="TYPE"      value="INBOOK">
<META name="PAGES"     value="103-108">
<META name="ISBN"      value="3-15-040005-8">

</HEAD>

I followed the Scribe (or BIBTEX) conventions as close as possible.
The meta info will not be shown by a browser. But there will be problems
when more meta info is needed, there is no way of further grouping the
meta informations. Except putting everything in the value field like

<META name="BIBTeX" value="@Book(Grimm,
				author='Grimm',
				title ='Little red riding hood')">

Any comments?

Subject: The value of navigability (related to META...)
content-length: 5878

        The Web's inexpensive creation and distribution of
          information calls for a focus on navigability

               (More lessons from the 15th century)

A while back in the META et cetera discussion, I mentioned the idea that
perhaps there's some underlying disagreement about the Web's value.  Nearly
everyone agrees that the capabilities under discussion are Good Things, but
there's some (often unspoken) dissent about which things should be
implemented sooner, rather than later.

Thanks to the income generated by the sale of my multimedia newsletter and
CompuServe forums a couple of years ago, I've had the freedom to spend much
of the last couple of years trying to understand the implications of the
convergence of inexpensive computers and networks.  I'm convinced that the
greatest obstacle, and thus the greatest opportunity and the area where the
most value can be added, is "information navigation," as I like to call the
broad concept of finding stuff in the midst of an information overload.  At
the risk of tooting my own horn, I'll add that this hasn't been casual
research; my strategic analysis and planning has involved some very bright
people whose names you'd probably all recognize.

Right now, the Web is providing tremendous access to information.  It is
rapidly accelerating the dream of "information at your fingertips," to
borrow Bill Gates' phrase.  But that's really just a start; access is
merely the enabler for navigability.  We really want a librarian at our
fingertips, I believe.

A simple supply and demand equation: Thanks to inexpensive networks and
computers, the supply of information is rising faster than our ability to
consume it.  The result is that the value of any given document is dropping
(even though overall volume is increasing).  The cost of *finding* a given
document is rising, however, for the same reason, especially when you're
just looking for something interesting.  Surely we've all had the
frustrating experience of seeing the cost of the time to find something on
the net (or a commercial on-line service) exceeding the value of the item
when we finally track it down.

The implication for HTML/HTTP is that features that improve document
navigability are paramount.  It's very tempting to follow the old
publishing paradigm and focus first on rich formatting and such, that would
be wrong and some other technology will surpass the Web quickly.

I like to make the comparison of today's convergence of inexpensive
computers and networks to the 15th century convergence of inexpensive
printing and paper (see <a
href="http://198.92.133.3/mendicants.html">Mendicant Sysops in
CyberSpace</a> on my server for a related short essay).  Illustrated
manuscripts, prior to Gutenberg and cheap paper, were beautiful things,
with carefully crafted letters, layout and images.  They're still
treasured.  But as we know, a lot of that beauty was abandoned by early
printing technologies.  At the same time, things were added -- punctuation,
title pages, consistent indexing, tables of contents and other navigational
structures.  The reason behind this was very much as it is today --
publishers wanted to be able to create catalogs of books created with
consistent structures.  Navigability was more important than appearance.

As we invent header structures for HTML documents, we're doing almost
exactly what printers-publishers did in the 15th century when they created
title pages.  Their book catalogs consisted of a collection of title pages;
a Web catalog will consist of a bunch of fields from the headers of
documents.  As we invent the structural tags of HTML documents, we're
mirroring the invention of tables of contents and punctuation that followed
Gutenberg and the Italian paper factories.  As we invent semantic tags,
we're mirroring the invention of consistent indexing.

There will be great pressure from the publishing industry, where I come
from, to focus primarily on the richness of the markup of individual
documents.  For the most part, those people should be ignored!  They don't
understand the paradigm shift that is underway.  They are married to mass
media models, in which the appearance of a document attracts readers and
customers to it.  In the new paradigm, there are too many documents to
view, so the appearance is less important than navigability, just as the
appearance of books in the 15th century didn't have to approach the beauty
of the illustrated manucripts on which they were based.

I don't mean to give short shrift to typography, layout, etc.  We should
all remember that eventually, printing technology gave us the kind of
quality that was present in illustrated manuscripts, though it was
centuries in coming.  I understand very well the importance of appearance,
in part to make documents readable, not just merely attractive.  But today,
as we invent this new means of communication, navigability is far, far more
important.

In the 15th century, printing and publishing became separated from writing
and editing.  A similar separation is occuring today; this one, which we
might call "virtual publishing," separates ownership of information from
its publication.  For example, it's practical for you to "publish" my
essay, mentioned above, in your newsletter or other document, without
having to buy the rights to it.  That's something really new, with profound
implications that I won't go into here.  I mention it because it only works
well if information is extremely navigable; it it's easy for me to find a
bunch of interesting stuff on the net and "virtually" organize it at my
site (which I've just barely begun to do, I should admit, 'cause the tools
are still crude!).

  To a certain degree, I agree with you here.

  Define markup, and I'll decide whether to agree or not.

One of the reasons why I have been asking for arbitrary SGML, and
arbitrary stylesheets is to aid navigation. An SGML document is (or
should be) basically a tree. One can use such structure for
sub-document navigtion, which might be important for very large
documents. The thing with stylesheets is perhaps not so much for
navigation, but with a generic stylesheet mechanism, parts of a
document can be formatted to best help people understand the
information. Such formatting might include removing large parts of
irrelevant data (for example, if you had a play, you might remove
everything *except* the names of the speakers, and when you clicked on
the speaker name, a box containing the speakers lines might appear).
This might seem like formatting, but it *is* related to navigation and
understanding via visual, and perhaps aural clues. 

I agree that net navigation is important. I also believe sub-document 
navigation is important. Let's try to support both.

The issue is more subtle than this. A colleague of mine, who is an
expert in these things, likes to start his lectures on SGML and TEI
with examples from pre-Gutenberg and early printed scholarly works, to
show the navigational aids that were lost when printing became
mechanized. Those books are pure Hypertext! On one page you could find
basically everything that was ever written on, say, Genesis 1:1,
logically mapped out, with cross references, annotations and
annotations-on-annotations, textual variants and bibliographic
references.

There is one more argument, and here we shouldn't ignore the pressure
from publishers: (good) publishers also have a commitment to long-term
availability. You can still follow a bibliographic reference in a book
published 200 years ago, but can you trust any URL in 200 years from
now?


PS. I like the last sentence of Nick's <a href=
"http://198.92.133.3/mendicants.html"> Mendicant Sysops in
CyberSpace</a>, which reads:

  "While starting a new venture in information navigation, Arnett is"

To preserve some semblance of brevity, I didn't mention that one of the
great frustrations for mendicant scholars studying illustrated manuscripts
was that each library had its own methods of indexing and linking.  Sound
familiar?  ;-)

That's odd.  It works from here...  What browser & platform are you using?

The rest of that sentence is *important*!  ;-)  It is:  "also working on a

Sarajevo library via the Internet</A>."

And then there's a copyright notice...!

That's a good question.  I'm drawing a distinction between markup that is
structural (within a document) and markup that is navigational (among
documents), except that if I'm not careful, I'll be trapped in a tautology.
Clearly, any kind of markup could potentially be interpreted for
navigational purposes.

I guess the difference is the explicit purpose of the markup.  For example,
tagging the words, "Bill Gates," with the information that he is chairman
of Microsoft seems to me to be explicitly for navigational purposes.  It
doesn't define the structure of the document in which is contained; it can
be used to define the relationship of the document to other documents.

I've never really made the distinction between net navigation and
sub-document navigation.  That's a matter of ownership and physical
location, primarily, I think.

I'm not sure I understand about the tree structure.  Surely you aren't
implying that *all* SGML documents should have a hierarchical structure,
which is how I interpret "tree."  Are you?

On the other hand, I have created documents like the one you describe,
which clearly are a great benefit of hypertext.  I love documents and
sub-documents, as you say, that expand and collapse according to complex
rules (complex to the programmer, that is).

As you all know, Ari Luotonen is not working on the CERN HTTP server for the moment. This leaves only yours truly to reply to bug reports and questions to www-bug and httpd. Furthermore, as I am working intensively on getting a new Library out in 1 week, the response time might drop a bit. Especially on questions concerning CGI scripts and Server cache, as I am new to this :-(

Thanks in advance for your comprehension

  OK. If, as it seems, you are saying that document structure markup
  is unimportant, I'll have to disagree strongly. The value of
  structured data cannot be underestimated. I *do* agree that
  navigational markup should be an integral part of any networked
  documents.

  I agree. So why build the one without the other? The best thing I
  could imagine would be a single method for naming a collection of
  documents, a document, or a part of a document.

>I'm not sure I understand about the tree structure.  Surely you aren't
>implying that *all* SGML documents should have a hierarchical structure,

  At the risk of upsetting everyone here, I'll point to HTML as an
  example of a "flat" DTD, so certainly, *all* SGML is not structured.
  I will say that I think almost all documents have some inherent
  structure that *could* be made explicit. Such structure can be used
  tp qualify searches, and to aid navigation...

  Given structured documents, and stylesheets, such things are easy to
  accomplish. One could generate TOC's in the same way...

It sounds to me that for the large part, we agree, but for some
reason, I feel that what has been said has not answered any questions,
nor brought any difference of opinion. Did I miss something?

<HEAVY SIGH> 

When will we realize that it is not possible to control HOW people choose
to use information? 

I like to think of Information as the Ultimate Corrosive.  You cannot 
control it, divert it, or contain it.  

Information permeates the universe and yet has no place of its own.  It has 
no geometry nor geography. 

Information has no handles or hooks, no tabs or slots.  It is 
uniquely formable but cannot be fixed.

What you can do is to observe it "in process."  But the moment you try to 
impose any form of intention or will upon it, it's gone, like truth in 
politics.

I think we ought to bite the bullet and support SGML's marked sections.
This allow you to switch on/off sections of a document with simple entity
declarations that can be set in the <!DOCTYPE> declaration or set by
client-side scripts or user preferences. It is too late to do this for
HTML 2.0, but I see no reason why HTML 3.0 compliant browsers should
duck this issue. The parsing mechanism is quite easy to implement.

Thank you to those who helped me solve my problem of installing Mosaic on a non

This kind of hierarchical info could be handled neatly with special
SGML elements. I am currently looking at how TEI handles this and
hope to come up with some concrete proposals later this month.

You can see the kind of thing that TEI allows in:

 a) The Classification Declaration - the <taxonomy> element

    http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV3&id=HD55

The <taxonomy> element has two slightly different, but related, functions.
For well-recognized and documented public classification schemes, such as
Dewey or other published descriptive thesauri, it contains simply a
bibliographic citation indicating where a full description of a particular
taxonomy may be found. For less easily accessible schemes, the <taxonomy>
element contains a description of the taxonomy itself as well as an optional
bibliographic citation.

This provides the means to define novel indexing schemes while preserving a
degree of interoperability. An alternative approach is to allow people to
define separate indexing DTDs and let each document specify which such DTD is
being used. Interoperability then rears its head, and can perhaps be assuaged
through the use of shared architectural forms.

 b) The Text Classification

    http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV3&id=HD43

This is used to classify particular documents using schemes that have been
declared via the <taxonomy> element. Thus a document can be classified by
reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification, the Library of Congress
Classification, or any other system widely used in library and documentation
work. Alternatively, the document can be classified by providing a set of
keywords as defined by say the British Library, or by referencing any other
taxonomy of text categories recognized in the field concerned, or peculiar to
the material in hand.

The home page for TEI is http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html

Yep - what I am trying to do is execute a script that compares the
script that you have asked to be executed with a set of scripts stored
in a directory that only I have write access to - if the script to be
executed is the same as one in my directory then the script gets
executed, otherwise the user get a message/window displaying the 
first page of the script and gets asked if they really want to execute
the script (the default being NO).

I'm sure there are all sorts of security holes with this strategy that
I haven't thought about - which I hope you will now tell me about !

That's effectively what I did - and it worked (with Mosaic and Lynx)
(I have used .mailcap and .mime.types in my $HOME directory and
mailcap and mime.types in /usr/local/lib/mosaic)

Nick Arnott's discussion is very stimulating:

The development of the printing press provided the means for the mass
dissemination of information but the other side of the coin is the
resultant rise in literacy to the point where a mass market, or audience if
you prefer, exists.  Printing wasn't inexpensive prior to the press, it
was pretty much non-existant.  Umberto Eco in "The Name of the Rose" has
fictionalised the strangle hold that the church had on "knowledge" in the
middle ages.  Thank goodness that this is no longer possible given the
quantity of information and the many ways of accessing it today.

and ...

We are unlikely to see the burning of individuals because they provide
contentious or inflamatory material by whatever means.  

The press changed the world almost beyond recognition.  The rise of
capitalism and scientific, historic and technological principles were
impossible without the ability to diseminate information and stimulate
intellectual activity in as wide a group as possible.

In the late 18C and early 19C the industrial revolution in Europe led to
the centralisation of the population in enormous cities.  Glasgow grew from
20,000 people in 1820 to more than 200,000 less than ten years later. 
Already the move back out of the cities has begun and is almost completely
facilitated by cheap PC's and reliable global networks.  

The Internet (web gopher AFTP et al) provides the model for a fundamental
change in society as large or larger than either the explosion (excuse the
hyperbole - these things are difficult to overstate) in literacy or the
development of the assembly line model of production.

Nick Arnott is absolutely correct in identifying navigability as the
crucial issue in this arena.  I see it in terms of threads.  Instead of
information enclosed in quotes, packets or nuggets, the idea of a pathway
through a sea of data where the compass bearing is an interest or a study
is a Web model and perhaps the most succinct.  Even as the thread is
followed documents along the way are old or new or updated seconds after a
copy is requested.

On Gopher, Veronica provides a good but unlinked method of finding
information but I havent seen, and to be honest I'm not sure what it would
look like, a web thread manager.  So much of the information is
in non .txt or .html format that providing indexing or keyword access to
much of the data is laborious and limited.

Interestingly there is a discussion going on about meta information which
seems highly related to not only object oriented methodology but also some of
the methods incorporated in the building of Intelligent Systems.

This methodolgy, although I do not claim to be an expert, allows for the creation of Frames (and scripts).  Essentially it groups information about entities in
a semantic manner.

The basic construct is Frame_Name, Slot, Facet, Value.

Here the frame name may be man, he has certain attributes or slots, which have values.  I could illucidate further, but this is not my point.  This point is tha
there seems to be an interest in semantic knowledge, grouping information in places where it is needed.  Intelligent Systems methodologies are related to studies of the ways people store information for use.

Perhaps it is the case that we could build Hypertext systems in a semantic way,
then to embrace these two above methodologies.

If you're really talking about testing for an *exact* match with a set
of scripts you've already vetted, compute a crypto checksum, e.g. the
MD5 hash of the incoming script and compare it against the checksum of
the pre-vetted script.

Asking the user if he is sure he wants to exexute a script puts the
user in an awkward position.  He usually doesn't have enough context
or enough knowledge to be able to sort out the issues properly.  If
you're serious about the strategy of permitting execution of
pre-vetted scripts, then you might want to extend that strategy to
handle new scripts.  Whenever a new script is presented, bring it over
and put it in a temporary place.  Then inform the user that the script
needs to be vetted.  The user can then be directed to review the
script and sign off on it before it's executable.  Don't force the
user to make the decision inline and without any support tools.  Less
convenient?  You bet.  Security always is.

A much simpler strategy is to create a controlled environment via
chroot and execute the script in that environment.  A wide range of
useful scripts will work ok.  Some safe and useful scripts will not
work because they'll need access to things outside the controlled
environment.  It's a trade off, and I don't know how often there would
be a problem.

This is fruitful.  The problem is classifying information.  Nick Arnott
thinks what we need is an electronic librarian - when I need to find an
item in cyberspace I go to a librarian who spends most of her time (for
which she feels guilty) traversing the net and indexing - on paper and in
her head the things she finds.  She is the best source I know.  

How do we use, catalog, retrieve and add value to information inside our own
heads?  A thread manager would automate this basic function on the web.

Places where it is needed?  There is only cyberplace.  The problem is
finding related information when no-one has thought to provide a hard link. 
It is almnost but not quite on the tip of your finger so to speak.

These are early days and even as we speak many people are titling and
heading their documents with more and more care and consideration for the
sheer mass of other docs available.  Perhaps, like ascii for .txt's and
Dewey for books and articles, an international standard classification
system for general information are needed.

The whole piece was about priorities -- the *relative* value of these
things.  I would never suggest that document structure markup is
unimportant.  It's very important.  The only point I was trying to make was
that navigational markup adds greater value than structural markup in the
context of the Web.  That doesn't imply anything about the absolute value
of each.  They're both high.  In a perfect world, where one didn't have to
set priorities, one would want each fully implemented immediately.

This could have interesting spin-off benefits.  If taxonomies' descriptions
were to become accessible via a standard mechanism, that would help solve
some of the nasty problem of needing a priori knowledge of the contents of
a information source for searching.  There's also some interesting research
into the merging of partially overlapping taxonomies to map sources to one
another and to create richer, er, meta-taxonomies.  There's some hope that
this is a means to begin to automate the generation of semantic networks.

While these are nice to have, they are not entirely needed. Much the
same effect can be achieved using different stylesheets. In one
stylesheet, one can say "any text enclosed by this element should be
hidden" and in another, one can say "any text enclosed by this element
should be rendered in italics".

This mechanism could suffice for things like expert and amateur
differentitation, but could fail for mixed languages etc.

Marked sections are very convenient for authors, and I agree that they
are not very difficult to implement. But I have some trouble imagining
the user interface at the client side. Should the browser present the
user with a message box saying:

	+---------------------------------+
	| This doc has multiple levels.   |
	| Check the ones you want to see. |
	|                                 |
	|  O  STGDIR                      |
	|  O  SPEECH                      |
	|  O  MRGNNUM                     |
	|                                 |
	|           +----------+          |
	|           |    OK    |          |
	|           +----------+          |
	+---------------------------------+ ?

How will the user know what the entities mean, by trial and error? One
method is to prescribe the entities and their meaning, but then we're
back at the problem of choosing semantic primitives. When you say
`user preferences' you seem to assume something like this.

The client-side scripts could indeed provide a solutions, since they
would allow the author of the document to, in fact, program this
dialog box himself.

BTW. this is different from the `folding elements' that were discussed
earlier. The folding element would have a button in the text that
indicated a hidden text. With marked sections, there is no indication
in the text at all.

But this would require you to define a structure in which ALL of the
elements you might possibly want to switch on/off can coexist. This is
simply not possible for many real documents.

Marked sections are a boon because they allow you to encode alternatives
which you know cannot co-exist in the same document structure.

That isn't the whole truth.  Not all bibliographic references can be
followed.  And in many cases you would at least have to pull out the
"backups" (visit archives of obscure works) to trace down something.

In both cases, the reference is only as good as the maintainer.  If you
want reliable links then only link to reliable sources.  And why not have
electronic libraries that archive the data of popular URLs?  If someone
wasn't saving all the books you would have the same problem.

I have my doubts that everything published electronicly is worth saving.
However, that doesn't mean that it isn't worth being published.  Take for
example mailing lists and newsgroups.  Some of them are archived forever
and ever and some are not.  But even in the later case people are still
happy to create followups and reference articles are soon drop into oblivion.

Sorry. It seems like we have been vehemently agreeing :-) 

I agree that navigational markup (on the Web scale) is of crushing
importance at the moment, but in time, the problem will be solved.
If we leave other issues until this is solved, we might miss a golden
opportunity for laying a foundation to build upon, and be stuck with
heavy renovations later. My only concern (which I'm sure is shared by 
everyone) is that we try to get as close to the elusive "right thing" 
as possible, as quickly as possible.

I hope this isn't too much of a tangent, but I must point out that there is
little or no evidence to suggest that the printing press directly led to a
rise in literacy. In fact, the long delay between the arrival of books and
the spread of literacy suggests that there is no cause-effect relationship.
Immediately after Gutenberg the masses bought indulgences and other
printed items, but literacy didn't spread until the Industrial Revolution,
a couple of centuries later, led to the creation of new wealth.

Those who argue that computers are widening the gap between the haves and
have-nots need only point to the 15th-16th centuries as a precedent.  But
the counter argument is to say that the printing press and paper moved the
Renaissance forward, which eventually led to the a narrowing of the gap via
the wealth created by the Industrial Revolution.

We can hope that just as Copernicus' access to many points of view of
cosmology helped him see a new universe, the Web and technologies like it
can make many points of view available to a relatively few bright people
today... and that those bright people will invent and create things that
will bring wealth and literacy to others.

Although I'm involved in bringing the net, the Web, etc. to poor
communities here in the U.S. and back to Sarajevo... but I have no
illusions that we'll see a sudden widespread rise in literacy because of
it.

If you haven't read Elizabeth Eisenstein's books on the printing press as
an agent of change, I'd highly recommend "The Printing Revolution in Early
Modern Europe" (Cambridge University Press, 1983).  Great stuff for anyone
engaged in this business.

I guess it's time to start the WWW-philosophy list.  ;-)

Subject: WWW html IS a User Interface.
Cc: Robert.Foster@radiology.msu.edu

Greetings,

I have been following some of the discussion regarding non-complication
of HTML syntax, style sheets, navigability, etc. and I would like to
add to and emphasize what I feel are some important points while
deliberately ignoring the technical problems of implementation...

_/]Keeping something simple is still possible with expanded capability.
Computers become more complex all the time but simplicity of use should
always be the goal for engineers and designers creating new systems.
The goal, in my mind, is to keep stylistic specification as simple as
the current HTML syntax while providing increased capability.

_/]Stylistic conventions should be a part of HTML/HTTP for the following
reasons:

>From Nick Arnett(nicka@mccmedia.com):

 |I like to make the comparison of today's convergence of inexpensive
 |computers and networks to the 15th century convergence of inexpensive
 |printing and paper (see <a
 |href="http://198.92.133.3/mendicants.html">Mendicant Sysops in
 |CyberSpace</a> on my server for a related short essay).  Illustrated
 |manuscripts, prior to Gutenberg and cheap paper, were beautiful things,
 |with carefully crafted letters, layout and images.  They're still
 |treasured.  But as we know, a lot of that beauty was abandoned by early
 |printing technologies.  At the same time, things were added -- ....

I agree with the previous analogy. However, beauty is *cultural*.

Stylistic conventions are not merely *decoration*. They have highly
specific cultural *significance*. The Book of Kells is Celtic. You see
that just by looking at it. All of the ascii character set has specific
english language symbols developed from centuries old writing sytems.
Other languages are the same. Graphical and stylistic extensions of a
writing system are an innate part of the communication. Ascii characters
on a computer screen *are* a stylistic convention.

_/]More and more people are gaining access to the inexpensive information
technology of the present global net. As in the past, most just want to
use the *system* in the normal way, reading, looking, turning the page...
The www should not *burn bridges behind them* when it comes to all of
the stylistic conventions developed for printed information.

Global electronic *publishing* requires some method of stylistic
specification beyond the basic ascii/ebcdic character set. The WWW is,
by it's nature, *culturally/accessably diverse*. Style is an innate
part of that diversity, understanding, and communication.

_/]Navigability *is* of prime importance. The WWW is in a general sense a
complex *user interface*.  Steps should be taken now to insure a www
system that accounts for cultural, access, and language diversity.

*Appearance is navigability* to members of a specific cultural community.

There are many methods thinking beings use to connect information. They
all use some sort of symbol system to communicate that to others. HTML/
HTTP should not constrain any of those methods if it is technologically
possible to allow them.

Thanks for your time.

	I agree that navigability is important! But I don't think
that calls for presentation features should be ignored. Certainly
it's possible to make a language that supports adequate design and
layout as well as consistent structure and easily searchable and navigable
information.
	This argument is I think largely due to the Web's lopsided
evolution: if all clients had editors built in from the start
(like the *first* browser on the NeXT), it would have been much easier to
put new structures, meta-information, and navigation tools into
practice, because editors could make it easy for people to
create such things and verify the structure.
	Instead, if you ask people today to support meta-information and
new document structures, a lot of them are going to implement this
manually...by hand. This is the equivalent of writing with a quill pen!
If Mosaic (and other clients) had editing capability, we could all be
in the word-processing age by now.
	I think it's important to continue working on both sides
(presentation and navigation) in respects to the language, but it's
also very important to concentrate on the tools that can write, display,
and navigate through this stuff.

Good thoughts!

Due to these very concerns, one of the first steps in our Sarajevo Library
project is to demonstrate the Web's capabilities to a small group of
Bosnian cultural leaders.  Their role will then be to define the Library's
mission and goals, as well as the fundamental design and structure.  We
realized from the beginning that designs and structures that work for us
might be confusing or meaningless to Bosnians.

By the way, I feel compelled to ask people to speak up if there's a more
appropriate place to discuss these sorts of issues.  I know that this list
tends to be primarily technical in nature.

But then again, Eisenstein says that one of the ways that the printing
press changed the world was by bringing people with different world-views
into close working relationships.  Educators, religious and printers saw
the world through one anothers' eyes and gained new insights.  She argues
that those interactions produced immediate changes, while the effects of
books were much more long-term.

Well, that's two now, so I must not have made it clear that I was only
talking about priorities.  I certainly didn't mean to imply that
presentation features should be ignored.  My little piece was about
priorities, not about the absolute value of either navigability or
presentation.

Please, folks, don't attribute to me this idea that presentation features
are unimportant.  I didn't mean to imply that, nor do I want to precipitate
flames on that subject.  Let's stick to the issue of priorities.

	As time goes by I think we'll find that in hypermedia
systems, appearance and navigability are entwined in ways we haven't
thought of yet. Those working on the standards have to balance a fine
line in thinking about the new architecture, and they have to
juggle a lot of wants and needs. I'd prefer a synergistic approach
myself, and this may not be practical, but don't discount it - the
Web is an entirely new beast and we may have to start thinking about
it in new ways if we want to make sure it lasts.

Agreed!  My worry is that big publishers, whose money gives them clout,
will steer this technology in the wrong direction.  In retrospect, saying
to ignore them was misplaced hyperbole.  Just don't them set direction
alone; many will see the new paradigm as a huge threat to their future.
Those who don't are likely to use the same values that have made them
successful in the past, which will be a mistake.

The main thing I would do to what David wrote is a global search/replace
of "specify" to "recommend"

HTML, as David points out is not a formatting language.  Some browsers
may not be able to display different colours at all, they may only be
able to display a limited number of colours at a time, or the total
number of colours may be limited.
[Note - these are NOT the same - I might be able to display blue, green,
red, yellow, cyan, magenta, black, and white - but supposing I wanted
text in grey or orange only...].

What the browser does in such cases will be browser dependent.

And even if the browser tells the server that it accepts "BLUE" as one of
its known colours, how do you know that what the browser thinks is BLUE
and what the server thinks is BLUE tally?

Most likely (well, even more than "most likely", as far as I've seen)
big publishers will devise proprietary ways to deliver their product
if they become frustrated with the level of (non)-development that 
takes place in the public arena.  Publishers are waking up now (at least
here they are :) that the AOL model is dead, that open systems and 
open technology are the most efficient way to go, and that there is
a professional-quality product (Mosaic) based on this openness.  
However, the "moving-target" quality of HTML development has been
frustrating those who want to know that the money they spend on
HTML authoring environments won't be wasted in two years when "the
next big thing" comes out.  I even felt some of this myself when 
the suggestion was brought up at the workshop on HTML+ at WWW94 that
current conformant HTML documents might not be conformant under 
subsequent versions of HTML.  It's hard enough as it is convincing 
people here to use <HTML> and <HEAD> in every document, when the
only good reason I can give is "so that we can be conformant for
future developments".  

So I guess I'm saying, completely ignoring the publishers is not a good idea,
as believe it or not the publishers might have some good ideas as well about
how to present information.  Some of them are even professionals at it.  I'm
looking forward to the standardization of HTML 2.0 and 3.0, as well as
compliant browsers and authoring environments, because I hope it'll allow the
creative-non-techie types to do everything they want to do, and allow me (the
semi-creative- but-more-techie-type) to make everything we do fits in with
the easy-to-navigate machine-paseable-semantics paradigm of ideal online
publishing.  Coz right now we're nowhere near that. 

Anyways, yeah, looks like if we want to continue this thread we should
move it somewhere else.  I could start a www-philosophy mailing list,
I suppose, but why not take it to WIT?  (http://info.cern.ch/wit/)

Okay, okay, I'm guilty of hyperbole.  I don't advocate ignoring publishers
-- I am one of those people who is a professional at it, after all.  I've
been a publisher and worked for others for years.  Decades, even.

I advocate ignoring the pressure that I hear from publishers to place a
priority on features that will make documents attractive rather than
emphasizing development of those that make an internetwork of documents
navigable.  My pre-emptive argument was based on the very fact that
publishers have good ideas about how to present information, because an
emphasis on presentation, rather than navigability, would be a major
mistake.

Perhaps a parallel will help.  When Hollywood people and computer people
join forces to create multimedia CD-ROMs, they tend to argue about the
budget for programming v. the budget for audiovisual production.  The
Hollywood people sneer at the audiovisual production values of typical
multimedia titles; the programmers sneer at the lack of interactivity and
UIs of Hollywood's productions.  In an ideal world, you do both very well,
but the usual result is that the budget goes through the roof, so you have
to set priorities.

Many different approaches will succeed; old models will persist for many
years.  But the overall trend on the net will be toward navigability and
away from luring people with attractiveness.  Elsewhere, in magazines, TV,
etc., the old paradigms will be in place for a long, long time.

Is WIT really workable?  I want technology that doesn't get in the way of a
good argument.  ;-)  Actually, though, I'm working on something similar.
Sort of.

One of the reasons I keep asking for arbitrary SGML (or perhaps a
reasonably complete subset thereof) be specified is that then, HTML,
HTML+, and whatever other things that are coming along, will all be
handled within the client, without changes (except for perhaps
dowloading DTD's and stylesheets). By not requiring validation, and
not using some nasties (like system entities could possibly be,
OMMITAG, and others), a simple, lightweight, arbitrary SGMl standard
could be defined, and a fast parser/render could be written for it. A
small matter of programming for those with time on their hands...

This is a presentation issue and a good one.  I too would like to be able to
implement colour in documents.  Correct me if I'm wrong though but there
does not need to be any correlation between what the server understands by
"BLUE" and what a client understands by "BLUE" - for the server it is just
a tag it sends out with the document - the server does not do any "client
processing" in this sense.  The client can translate "COLOR=BLUE" as purple
with yellow spots  - just as <h1> ... </h1> is configurable using Mosaic to
whatever you like.  If a client does not accept a given tag can't it just
ignore it?

Yes - good idea.

Publishers?  Some newspapers may come on-line soon, I know some are
thinking about it.  Newspapers represent a particular type of presentation
with headlines, bylines, editorials and images.  The style of these, as
anyone who is fond of one particular paper will agree, is important.  It
isn't just readability - its almost cultural.

Navigability is still the most important issue but it's a technical issue -
finding information in cyberplace is extremely difficult without aids but
presentational issues will not go away.

Perhaps the two are not mutually distinct - the "feel" of a document can be
a pointer to its general content?

Agreed, but there would be a subtle difference.  If a document is expired,
the cache knows it's going to serve an outdated copy, and is free to do so.
If a document is marked 'not to be cached', the cache is not allowed to
cache it at all.  (For example, because of copyright violation.)
Of course 'Expires: 0' could be assigned to have that meaning, which would
eliminate the need for an extra header.

I'll retry this question on www-proxy.

Lying in bed last night I thought of information on the web in terms of
candy floss.  I probably spend too much time on usenet (sorry) but the

Information is all things to all men, all women.  Our own particular needle,

This is my favourite list.

Er, well, sort of.  Obviously it's not difficult to hide nasty stuff
in the second page of the script.  I'm somewhat leery of counting on
the user to be smart enough to judge the safeness of an arbitrary
program on the fly; Stephen Crocker's observations seem on target.

And naturally people who are security-conscious will want to hurry and
download the binaries for which source is not made available and check
them out. :-)  Do you have any example programs for it (non-trivial
ones, I mean)?

The C shell hardly seems a suitable language for evaluation of
untrusted code.  What's wrong with Safe-Tcl?

On the other side of the pond, in the US, we have something called

But seriously, I notice that mosaic implements a .mosaic-global-history
file that contains entries stored from a user's selections in the form:

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html

followed by a date.

This is stored in the user's home directory and would best be kept as
a private access file. It seems to me that this would be a good place to
start with a user defined *thread*. Allowing a user to log, format the
sequence, edit these entries in to a customized home page, format them
in a visual way, group them semantically, etc. is something that I have
already wished for already. Perhaps some browsers implement this
already?

The same security-consious people are using Mosaic binaries left and right, 
so what's your point ?

Besides, I did not make claims about the level of trustedness anyway, so....

The sources will be available as soon as i clean up the code.
what do you mean by example programs ? If you mean a URL that you can try
this against, you may try:
	http://www.eit.com/cgi-bin/mediaform

However you will need some of the MBONE tools for this. MBONE tools

There are situations when an HTTP server may want to indicate that it is too 
busy to accept a request. There is no code for this defined in the HTTP2 spec. 
Taking the "spirit" of the 400 vs 500 errors, since this is a server 
"problem", it seems like the 500 series is appropriate.

The Windows httpd (v1.2b8 and later) reports when it is too busy to accept 
another request by returning a "503 Too Busy", followed by a short HTML 
message. What it means is that there are already 8 active transactions, the 
server's limit. The error is returned in the server dispatcher thread without 
starting any new transaction threads.

If nobody argues, I'll leave it that way. It ought to get added to the spec.

Er, no, they're grabbing the source and compiling it themselves.

I guess I don't see the point to withholding the source.  It's a
rather trivial program anyway; probably could be done in perl in a few
lines.

That's certainly reassuring.

By an example program I mean a program that you would feed to it and
have it do something.  By non-trivial I mean a program that does
something more than just start up a different program.

Well, within the domain of moving around programs in a Web environment,
there are two somewhat different things (well, actually there's a
continuum between them, but anyway...)

- Using the Web to launch an application you already have installed
  and certified as appropriate to this use; for instance,
   o Launching WordPerfect
   o Running a multimedia server
   o Printing the current screen
   o Popping up an xclock
- Using the Web to download an arbitrary program which provides some
  functionality that was not preexisting and run it automatically; for
  instance,
   o An interactive form
   o A simple animation controlled by the user
   o Prompt the user for a ten numbers, then do an animation of a
     bubble sort on that list
   o A slideshow
   o A guided tour

Each of these things has value, although to me the first is mostly a
special case of the second; that's why I'm much more interested in
trying to make the second happen.  Attempting to accomplish the first
of these is the domain of things like the "exec" method for URLs.
Attempting to accomplish the second of these is the domain of safe
languages like Safe-Tcl.

>From what I can see, it looks as though your system is much closer to
being a application-launcher than a programming language.  That
doesn't mean it's bad, but it means that making the language secure
has rather severely lobotomized it.

Well, I don't think I would exactly say something is "wrong" with it.
If I understand it correctly, it can only exec other applications,
which makes calling it "vsafecsh" seems a bit misleading, since it
can't do anything that makes the C shell the C shell (since csh can
have conditionals, iteration, variables, substitution, pipes, and
other programming language stuff; it does it badly, and is an
extremely poor choice of shells to program in, but it does do it.)

I just hope that a language that gets widely used for client-side
execution is not just secure but also portable and powerful.

Status: In Review

   The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in June of
   1992. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in the usage of HTML,
   and certain new features have emerged. Widespread commercial support for
   HTML is on the horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of
   features in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.
   
   These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability among
   developing HTML implementations, and to investigate interactions with
   implementations that support more or fewer features than the current
   practice.
   
   I consider the document at "first draft" stage -- most of the technical
   issues have been thought out (but not widely reviewed), but there has been
   very little emphasis on editorial matters.
   
Review and Publication Process

   The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international consortium
   in the future, but since the need for this document is immediate, it will be
   published as an SGML Open Technical Report. An SGML Open technical committee
   is forming. Contact Dan Connolly <connolly@hal.com>, or Yuri Rubinski,
   <yuri@sq.com> for details.
   
   As usual, the document will be publicly available throughout the review
   process, and comments may be submitted through internet mail to the editors
   or to the <www-talk@info.cern.ch>mailing list.

Announcing the Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) Mailing List!

What is VRML?

Virtual Reality Markup Language or VRML is an evolving specification for a
platform-independent definition of 3-dimensional spaces within the 
WorldWideWeb.  It is designed to combine the best features of virtual reality,
networked visualization, and the global hypermedia enviornment of 
the WorldWideWeb. 

Why is there a VRML mailing list?

Due to the intense interest expressed within the WorldWideWeb community
during WWW '94 in Geneva, we have begun an open forum discussion for the 
design and implementation of a platform-independent language for virtual
reality object design/scene design/linkage to the Web.

Is there a WorldWideWeb site for VRML?

Yes.  The folks at WIRED have very kindly given us some of their bandwidth
and disk space.  The URL for the VRML Forum is:

http://www.wired.com/vrml/

We hope that this site will grow into a major resource for individuals and
groups developing VRML viewers/authoring tools/etc.  There are a number
of links from this site to other works, including two papers from WWW '94
which outline, in some detail, the requirements for VRML.

How do I subscribe to the VRML mailing list?

To subscribe to the list send mail to: majordomo@wired.com
No subject field, message body: subscribe www-vrml

Within a few minutes you should get a reply from the server at wired.com.

We hope to see you there!

How long is the average transaction active?  I'd guess a second or two, tops.
If you think it's necessary to define a hard upper limit on number of
simultaneous transactions, it would be much preferable to try to just block
and wait for an existing transaction to terminate if that's possible, subject
to some sort of timeout error of course.

Having to wait a couple seconds instead of having to keep retrying makes
for much less overhead for the server, the network, the client and the user.

This error message is also a good way to indicate when a proxy server is
unable to complete an FTP transaction because the remote FTP server has
reached its user limit. Currently this is reported as a 500 error.

For completeness sake, I would like to see this response added to the HTTP
specification.

I glad someone spoke up to say that it's interesting!  I feared the
opposite... ;-)

Quick, someone provoke me.

By the way, I'm getting more and more bent on the collaborative tools
issue.  Some associates and I are going to start working on a strategic
plan via the Web and mail.  We'll let you know what we discover and at some
point we'll open it up to all, probably.  It's for a non-profit
after-school program where I'm on the board.  One of the goals is to
develop a plan for collaborating via the net with other youth centers.

Dan,

The description of FORMs in HTML 2.0 specification document is still  
a bit dusty from its long repose on the CERN server.  As you can  
imagine, I'm particularly interested in seeing good descriptions of  
the graphical input elements in FORMs, but there are other rough  
spots as well.  Here are the problems I noticed:

>                              FORM
[...]
> The effect of the action can be modified by including a
> method prefix, e.g. ACTION="POST http://...." . This
> prefix is used to select the HTTP method when sending the

This seems out of date -- the METHOD attribute has been widely  
accepted for a long time.  I don't think we should encourage anyone  
to use the syntax shown above.
                        

> NAME		Symbolic name used when transferring the
> 		form's contents. This attribute is always
> 		needed and should uniquely identify this
> 		field.

The spirit is right, but this doesn't quite hold in either direction.   
Existence -- "reset" and (under certain conditions) "submit" INPUTs  
can anonymous.  Uniqueness -- different "radio" INPUTs can be grouped  
by having the same NAME.

> SRC		A URL or URN specifying an image - for use
>		only with TYPE=IMAGEMAP.

There is no type "imagemap", only "image".  Also, this contradicts  
the later claim in the description of the "submit" abd "reset" INPUT  
types, that they support the SRC attribute.

> ALIGN		Vertical alignment of the image - for use
>		only with TYPE=IMAGEMAP.

Again, there is no type "imagemap", only "image".  And if the  
"submit" and "reset" INPUTs really support the SRC attribute, they  
should also accept the ALIGN attribute.

> PROPSED
>   

> CHECKED	When present indicates that a checkbox or
> 		radio button is selected.

According to the DTD and current practice, CHECKED is a standard  
attribute, not merely "proposed".
  

> TEXT		Single line text entry fields. Use the SIZE
>		attribute to specify the visible width in
>		characters, e.g. SIZE="24" for a 24 character
>		field.

The DTD allows both width and height can be specified, using  
space-delimited numbers.  Even though the TEXTAREA element is  
intended to be better suited for multiline text entry, it seems  
reasonable to be liberal in this regard.  Current practice also  
allows both width and height to be specified, although there is some  
confusion about the syntax (e.g. X Mosaic 2.4 insists on comma  
separation).

>		The MAX attribute can be used to
>		specify an upper limit to the number of
>		characters that can be entered into a text
>		field, e.g. MAX=72 .

Shouldn't that be MAXLENGTH?

> CHECKBOX	Used for simple Boolean attributes, or for
>		attributes which can take multiple values at
>		the same time. The latter is represented by a
>		number of checkbox fields each of which has
>		the same NAME .

Multiple checkboxes with the same NAME?  I haven't seen this feature  
before.  What would the returned VALUE be?  The spec does not say.

> SUBMIT	This is a button that when pressed submits
>		the form. It offers authors control over the
>		location of this button. You can use an image
>		as a submit button by specifying a URL with
>		the SRC attribute.

This description says nothing about what is done with the SRC image  
other than to use it for rendering the button.  If -- as I hope --  
the intent here is to smooth the transition to HTML 3.0, by offering  
already in HTML 2.0 an upward-compatible alternative to the IMAGE  
input, then the specification needs to be MUCH more precise in order  
to achieve useful standardization.

For example, it needs to be specified that the result of clicking on  
the image is to send back the selected coordinates, the x-coordinate  
being associated with the key NAME.x, and the y-coordinate with  
NAME.y.  It should be specified that the coordinates are in pixel  
units, with the origin at the top left of the image.  And so on.

> PROPOSED TYPES

> SCRIBBLE	A field upon which you can write with a pen
>		or mouse.  [...]

I am happy to see the "scribble" INPUT being advocated through the  
use of "proposed" status in HTML 2.0.  However, the description here  
is dangerously vague!  There should either be a one-sentence summary  
that does not pretend to go into detail, or a MUCH more precise  
specification lifted from HTML 3.0.

> OBSOLETE TYPES

> IMAGE		This allows you to specify an image field
>		upon which you can click with a pointing
>		device. The SRC and ALIGN attributes are
>		exactly the same as for the IMG and IMAGE
>		elements.

Please don't give me a heart attack!!! :-)  The "image" INPUT is not  
obsolete in HTML 2.0!  I understand that it will be obsoleted in HTML  
3.0, but the HTML 2.0 DTD gives it official status, as per previous  
long discussions about the goals and scope of HTML 2.0.

On the other hand, what is the IMAGE element?  I can find no mention  
of it anywhere in the DTD.

I'll start with a simple comment -- the following is wrong in
<http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/Tags.html>:

     Obsolete head elements

     META 
        A wrapper for an HTTP element 


META cannot be an obsolete element because it has never existed in past
versions of HTML.

META should be a proposed element, with syntax and semantics fully
defined in the spec as per our prior discussion on www-html.
[I'm not surprised that it has not yet been included, I'm just making the
claim that it should be included as a proposed element before the 2.0 spec
can be considered complete].

Furthermore, all proposed elements should be fully defined in the spec
if their definition is known, and a "Proposed extensions to the DTD"
section should be included as well.  If the definition is not known,
the purpose of the element should just be considered a "future direction"
and lumped together with other undefined stuff in some descriptive appendix.

This error message is also a good way to indicate when a proxy server is
unable to complete an FTP transaction because the remote FTP server has
reached its user limit. Currently this is reported as a 500 error.

For completeness sake, I would like to see this response added to the HTTP
specification.

----- End Included Message ----

The reason for the 500 codes generated in the CERN Library as a result of a failed FTP session is to avoid having all kinds off error codes flying around in the HTTP response when connecting to a Proxy server. The same is the case in Gopher etc. etc.

Instead, the human readable messages from the various protocols are parsed using a nested error handling module, so that the user still can see why the session failed:

Requested URL: ftp://info.cern.ch/test

Reply to user: WWW Alert:  Fatal Error 500
	       Can't Access Document ftp://info.cern.ch/test
	       Reason: FTP-server replies test: No such file or directory

Though, the top-level message is always a HTTP message.

BTW: Another code that I would like to get in is

	502 Bad response

if the server response is wrong.

Subject: Including files

One extension to HTML that I think would be very usefule would be a
generalisation of the <img src="URL"> markup.  Ideally I would like a markup
which would allow the inclusion of any file type e.g. <include src="URL">.

This would allow html documents to include (rather than link to) other
documents.  An example of where this would be useful is where there are large
amounts of frequently used text such as standard disclaimers that need to be
included in all the documents available at a server.  It would greatly
simplify the maintenance of documents sholud the standard text need to change
at some point.

What sort of problems would the inclusion of an HTML document within another
HTML document present to viewers?

A quick word.

www-talk sounds pretty open-ended a name.  There are probably a number of
lists that could be run around the w3-*.  w3-phil, w3-tech, w3-html,
w3-docs(.ps,.txt,.html,.jpg,.gif,.etc), www-info.  I suggest that two are
called for at present.  www-talk should spawn a technical list www-tech to
discuss technical issues: clients, servers, related technologies - wais,
gopher, gn.  If people want to keep www-talk for technical issues then I
suggest a www-info to group all the rest temporarily.

w3 is absolutely brilliant.  The very business.  I don't claim to be an

Is the extension you have in mind processed by the server or the client?

For the server, such a feature already exists in NCSA's HTTP server.  When
returning an HTML document, it will process include directives for HTML
text.

For handling on the client end, things get more complicated.  The core 
issue is:  what does it mean to "include" a document of type X into an HTML 
document?  If the included document is HTML, you get stuff like this:

<head><title>Outer</title></head>
<body>
  <head><title>Inner included document</title></head>
  <body>Here it is!</body>
</body>

Is this meaningful?  What does mean to have more than one [pick your favorite
construct] in an HTML document?  

If the included document is some other type, what does it mean to include 
it?   What if I include a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document--what does 
that look like?

From: Nigel Metheringham <nigelm@ohm.york.ac.uk>
content-length: 1837


The current protection scheme in the CERN httpd uses unix like passwd
and group files.  These are sequentially read on each protected access
check - which could be a problem if you have large numbers of users in
these databases.

Like many sites, much of the stuff we might want to protect would be
protected at a relatively low level, and be available to large subsets
of our users.  We use NIS for distributing authorisation info (bad
idea I know).

I'd like to be make a change to the httpd protection stuff to enable
other sources of authorisation info than flat files.  The sort of
change I was wondering about was to change the spec for the passwd &
group files to allow this sort of spec:-

	PasswordFile	/some/flat/file		# ie as present
	PasswordFile	//nis:nis_map_name	# use NIS map nis_map_name
	PasswordFile	//dbm:/dbm/file/spec	# DBM hashed password file
	PasswordFile	//netinfo:/net/in/spec	# NeXT netinfo

[not sure about the netinfo - since it is richer than NIS it could
present more problems...]  Group file specs would look similar.

The main advantages this would give is keyed lookups (saving in time
when accessing auth info), flexibility - you can keep info in (say)
NIS, and it doesn't *have* to be just in a NIS system passwd file.

As an extension to this, NIS netgroups could also be used to control
access - both for hosts and users.  However this needs slightly more
serious mods to the appropriate areas of httpd.

[Pause while dons asbestos underware]
Any comments on this please....?

    generalisation of the <img src="URL"> markup.  Ideally I would like a markup
    which would allow the inclusion of any file type e.g. <include src="URL">.

Instead of adding a new mark-up, why not just extend <A> by adding a parameter
which declares whether the link is included?

<A href="URL" ACCESS="inline">

This will allow extensions for conditional incline inclusion and other kinds
of inline document relationships as necessary.

ACCESS=		"jump"			- the default go to document.
		"inline"		- inline the contents of URL.
		"toggle"		- contents can be opend and closed inline.
		"when#var"		- inline document when var is true.

This extension could allow specialized mark-up for images to be folded into
<A>, thus reducing the working set and maintaining tight abstraction.

Whatever would happen when you created a single HTML document should happen
when you include subdocuments.  This means that its up to the user to write
"partial" HTML documents and/or the browser could ignore the second HEAD pair
(if everyone used HEAD) and just ignore the BODY.  Since the latter probably
isn't DTD compliant, its up to the user to make sure the document looks right.

Again, if the browser has external viewer support, just run the viewer.  For
example, when reading <include src="stuff.ps"> the browser just fetches the
document then spawns off a postscript viewer.  Using the option to ignore
inline images in Mosaic could work the same way here - it could allow only
including text or html and not images or external viewers.

Including from the server side obviously works better for a lot of stuff
(although a lot of caching benefits seem to get lost when it isn't done right).
However, there doesn't seem any reason why includes should be limited to
just gif images.

If you start including subdocuments, or with lots of inline images, you're
back to the need for a multiple GET - one that gets more than one file during
a connection.  Has any progress been made on this?

I do not want the discussion to go to wit, at least not in its

cumbersome to use.

It would be very interesting to use a structured discussion system
such as WIT aspires to be.  But WIT is not ready for use.

On the other hand - you want to discuss things there, go ahead. It's a

It's far more complicated. (But that shouldn't prevent us from
specifying and implementing it.) The general case is to include
only part of the document, for example just a single paragraph from
someone else's larger work. Or even the whole document - which
would in this case mean the <BODY> element, but without the <BODY>
tags. We first need to have a specification on how to reference a
certain part of a document and second have servers being able to
extract the referenced part from the HTML file and put it on the
wire.

No, that's not the same. The Excel spreadsheet should appear right
in the browser's window, inline with the surrounding text. The idea
is to inline not only GIF images, HTML text or any other document
type, but also *objects* which perform their duty somewhere remote.

Subject: Why go w3
content-length: 1120

Why get a wheel?

We have a presentation to our VC his two lieutenants and our HOD next
Monday.  We're primarily showing our hypertext course and module
information database - still under dev.  The VC has a reputation - he
removed even the *MAC* from his desk.  We plan to show the CourseInfo
database from a wider point of view - central master store for this data,
easily accessible from anywhere in the institution or beyond, etc.  This is
not strictly our show - it's the registry.  We have been lucky in that we
have one or two non Computing people here who have gotten excited and have
been in a position to prepare large quantities of data for the services.

Getting someone outside your department, on the data prep and input side
helps immeasurably - these things then develop their own momentum.  Our IP
of the month (year actually) has developed the data collection, preparation
and uploading into a gn-2.07 server all by his lonesome.  We now have a
product inside the general reaons for going w3.  This might not help but
the point is any ally is useful at this stage.

Here are some more and less effective ways to comment on
the 2.0 spec:

* "I'd like to see HTML extended to include ..."
  This is out of the scope of the 2.0 effort. We're trying
  to be largely descriptive of current practice. www-talk
  is still an OK forum for these comments... Dave Ragget
  is always listening. But I have blinders on.

* "Here's a proposal for an HTML extension ... [proposed
  spec extension included]"
  I might have time to stick this in as a proposed feature.
  No guarantees.

* "In http:...., you wrote XXX, which is wrong. What
  actually happens is YYY"
  I'll try to address these, but this format doesn't
  save me any time -- it only creates work for me to do.

* "The http:.... node isn't quite right. Here's a replacement
  [or diffs] and a few test cases to demonstrate the
  subtleties"
  Bingo. You're nearly guaranteed to get your comments in
  if you submit them this way.

Thank you for your support.

This is a more complicated approach than I think is warrented.  Including only
part of an original document (that had not been intended for inclusion) is a
far more general problem.  I'm not sure that including part of a document is
meaningful, what do you expect to see if you include bytes 104255 to 122351
from a gif file?

The advantage of the include markup would be that the user wouldnot have to
click on a link to follow it.  Simply openeing the document would force the
following of the include links.  If the link is to something like a postscript
document (or an Excel spreadsheet) then I would expect the appropriate viewer
to be spawned.  If it were to a file which the client can interpret then the
output would be displayed inline.  (In fact the include directive might have
the ability to specify if the display was to be inline or with a seperate
viewer).  The issues which do need to be resolved are those of interpreting
included documents which are displayed inline, an example of this is how to
handle an included html document.  The browser would know the context as it
would have executed the include markup, and so can distinguish the included
document from a syntax error in a single document.  (This assumes that the
include is executed by the client not the server).

Yes, and we should address it.

Nothing, but what about the rectangle specified by (123,100) and
(567,400) from said GIF file? Or "chapter 4" (whatever that means)
or everything between "marker 3" and "marker 6" from a HTML
document?

    I do not want the discussion to go to wit, at least not in its
    current form.  Wit has lots and lots of good ideas (all praise to its
    maker!) but in the current form at least it is unbearably
    cumbersome to use.

OK. Spell out what is wrong with it and what fixes it requires.

    It would be very interesting to use a structured discussion system
    such as WIT aspires to be.  But WIT is not ready for use.

Again specifics.  if you want a system ready for use, you have
to come up with specific improvements it needs.

    On the other hand - you want to discuss things there, go ahead. It's a 
    free country --- ooops I mean free Internet.

    It's far more complicated. (But that shouldn't prevent us from
    specifying and implementing it.) The general case is to include
    only part of the document, for example just a single paragraph from
    someone else's larger work. Or even the whole document - which
    would in this case mean the <BODY> element, but without the <BODY>
    tags. We first need to have a specification on how to reference a
    certain part of a document and second have servers being able to
    extract the referenced part from the HTML file and put it on the
    wire.

This means extending URL syntax to reference regions in documents, not just
named points. 

You need to points to make a region.

So, you could cheat by adding href-end= (gross).

Or better, your could have some url syntax like http://foo.bar.bas/doc.html#start,end

It would be nice if START and END could be more than just document position
tags.  Once we have some concept on referencing fragements by alternative
schemes in the URN spec, one should be able to use these.

One idea is positional specs like:

#{char=24},{char=40}

#{h1=1},{h1=2}

The general idea is that one provides a variety of named methods for denoting
a position in a document.  These can be extended as better ideas come along.

Note that this ability to reference fragments is exactly what WIT needs to in
order for prople to effectively respond to parts of what other say.

It would be extremely desirable (but hard) to be able to resolve URL region
fragments without fully accessing the document.

Shen: Security Extensions for HTTP
=================================

In response to a number of requests a number of security extensions
to the HTTP protocol have been implemented. These provide for secure 
password based authentication using message digest functions, secure
authentication using public key cryptography and secure message
encryption.

A web of the proposal can be found at:

<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html>


Please note, discussion of these proposals is ENCOURAGED. None of them
are set in stone (as yet). 

This work is builds on the proposal by Tony Sanders of BSDI and the
original authentication scheme. It is hoped that integration with the
Secure HTTP proposal from CommerceNet will result in a common Web
standard for security systems. 

One area in which debate is encouraged is on the subject of how to
ship key certificates about. I have views on this but I don't want to
be seen as trying to impose my ideas on such an important issue. The
structure of the WWW key certificate system may IMHO be the most
important discussion for the future of the web.


Executive Summary
-----------------

The following changes to the spec are proposed:

1) The BASIC scheme is discouraged. This scheme is supported for
	the moment as a compatibility mode and should IMHO be
	phased out in the near future.

2) A DIGEST scheme is proposed as a direct replacement for the password
	scheme. This uses only a message digest function and it is hoped
	that it can be used without legal problems. Under this system
	the password is never sent over the net in plaintext.

3) A Public Key Authentication system based on PEM.

4) A Public Key encryption system based on PEM.


Discussion List
---------------

A WIT on the security issues has been started on:

<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/Discussion>


Code
----

Because of the various export restrictions we cannot make the source
code avaliable on a free for all basis at the moment. Because of the
laws banning import and export of cryptographic systems to and from
the USA a portion of the code will have to be rewritten there.

Because of this limitation the first release is demonstration
only. Although the binaries provide secure encryption
and decryption the server also sends the session key across in
plaintext. This means that the encryption portion of the product
is useful only for testing compatibility - which is the purpose
of this release.

The initial release consists of a patched version of Mosaic and a
patched version of the CERN httpd. Binaries compiled for SUN under
SunOS are avaliable under the Shen Web.


Patched versions of the source code for Mosaic and the Daemon
will appear as soon as the interface has been cleaned up and made
conformant with the libwww coding standards.

NB these portions do *NOT* contain the cryptographic interface
library "Shen". This will be made avaliable on a discresionary
basis to users in certain countries only.


Copyright
---------

The Shen extensions are copyright CERN and do not form part of the
public domain code release. This restriction is necessary for the
time being for legal reasons.

Use is permitted at present for research purposes only.


Accessories
-----------

The first Security extension accessories, a mail server CGI module
will be released in the `near' future.


Funding
-------

This work was funded by CERN and the European Union.

I have a solution...

I guess this is as good a time as any to reveal that I've been converting
this list (and others related to the Web, libraries, Macs, Bosnia and more,
see list below) to HTML on one of my servers.  You can browse them by the
subject, date or sender fields.  I've had full-text search via gopher, but
it's not up right now.  I'm waiting for a cgi link from MacHTTP to
AppleSearch that Chuck Shotten is working on, though I have a beta of
another search engine that I'm also going to try.

The HTML-ized list is somewhat threaded -- there are links to all replies
at the bottom of the parent message.  Some of the older message threading
might still have the wrong message as the parent; I wasn't parsing the
offset time properly.  It italicizes quoted text (usually) and makes URLs
in message text into HREFs, although there are still occasional bugs in
detecting the end of the URL.  Text wrap, as usual in e-mail, is a
nightmare, but it seems fairly good now.

Further steps will be to actually find the quoted text in the parent and
thus create real threading, archive the messsages as complete threads in
HTML with full-text search, and then, at last, my real objective, which is
to start working on some collaborative filtering tools and such.

Interesting idea. Along those lines, I thought about returning a "redirect"
which points right back to the object that was sought in the first place.
I junked it when I realized that it violates the most basic principals of
congestion control!
<end inseparable text :-) >

I see a potential problem with your suggestion which relates to relative
URLs. Unless the mirror site mirrors the entire original site, relative
URLs could break.

Another issue is synchronization. Suppose the primary site makes a change
to the document "web" resulting in link changes. Now let's say you're
reading around in the primary site's web, it gets busy, you get redirected
to the secondary site, and the link is invalid because the mirror site
hasn't been sync'ed since the changes at the primary.

Shen: Security Extensions for HTTP
=================================

In response to a number of requests a number of security extensions
to the HTTP protocol have been implemented. These provide for secure 
password based authentication using message digest functions, secure
authentication using public key cryptography and secure message
encryption.

A web of the proposal can be found at:

<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html>


Please note, discussion of these proposals is ENCOURAGED. None of them
are set in stone (as yet). 

This work is builds on the proposal by Tony Sanders of BSDI and the
original authentication scheme. It is hoped that integration with the
Secure HTTP proposal from CommerceNet will result in a common Web
standard for security systems. 

One area in which debate is encouraged is on the subject of how to
ship key certificates about. I have views on this but I don't want to
be seen as trying to impose my ideas on such an important issue. The
structure of the WWW key certificate system may IMHO be the most
important discussion for the future of the web.


Executive Summary
-----------------

The following changes to the spec are proposed:

1) The BASIC scheme is discouraged. This scheme is supported for
	the moment as a compatibility mode and should IMHO be
	phased out in the near future.

2) A DIGEST scheme is proposed as a direct replacement for the password
	scheme. This uses only a message digest function and it is hoped
	that it can be used without legal problems. Under this system
	the password is never sent over the net in plaintext.

3) A Public Key Authentication system based on PEM.

4) A Public Key encryption system based on PEM.


Discussion List
---------------

A WIT on the security issues has been started on:

<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/Discussion>


Code
----

Because of the various export restrictions we cannot make the source
code avaliable on a free for all basis at the moment. Because of the
laws banning import and export of cryptographic systems to and from
the USA a portion of the code will have to be rewritten there.

Because of this limitation the first release is demonstration
only. Although the binaries provide secure encryption
and decryption the server also sends the session key across in
plaintext. This means that the encryption portion of the product
is useful only for testing compatibility - which is the purpose
of this release.

The initial release consists of a patched version of Mosaic and a
patched version of the CERN httpd. Binaries compiled for SUN under
SunOS are avaliable under the Shen Web.


Patched versions of the source code for Mosaic and the Daemon
will appear as soon as the interface has been cleaned up and made
conformant with the libwww coding standards.

NB these portions do *NOT* contain the cryptographic interface
library "Shen". This will be made avaliable on a discresionary
basis to users in certain countries only.


Copyright
---------

The Shen extensions are copyright CERN and do not form part of the
public domain code release. This restriction is necessary for the
time being for legal reasons.

Use is permitted at present for research purposes only.


Accessories
-----------

The first Security extension accessories, a mail server CGI module
will be released in the `near' future.


Funding
-------

This work was funded by CERN and the European Union.

No, this would be a bad idea. The original suggestion was a syntax of the form 
<include src="URL">. So there is nothing to prevent that URL being fetched as a 
standalone document, since it has a URL. [Equally, this syntax implies client 
side processing, sing the URL to include might well be on a different server to 
the main document].

Following your suggestion would allow servers to have non-compliant documents 
whose intention was as boilerplate text but which would not work as standalone 
documents.

A better option would be to have whole documents. Then look for <head>, if found 
strip off everything from <head> to </head>. Look for <body>, if found strip it 
off and make a note to look for </body> at the end after it has been included.

While this would probably work, I am not sure that it is desirable. If a part of 
a document is all self contained and has it's own URL, why not just put in a 
link to it which the reader can follow or not as needed? This also neatly avoids 
the issue of what to do if the main document is retrieved OK but the included 
document is not.

Maybe we could standardise on displaying the CERN logo inline in such 
circumstances ;-)

Including small fragments is really a separate issue. Such fragments - a single 
paragraph, a couple of list items - should not be externally accessible so 
should be all done on the server side. The files stored on the server may then 
NOT be complete compliant documents in their own right, which is not necessarily 
a problem provided what is delivered to the client IS.

Given that we have singularly failed to learn from the experiences of 20+ years 
of programming language design and are still effectively at the "cut and paste  
school of programming" stage with all the attendant problems of consistency, 
maintainability and duplication of work, I would like to see this issue tackled 
so that editing of a standard fragment is only done once and then applied 
consitently to update all documents that use it.

This is of course a server issue rather than an HTML issue, because it is up to 
the server to maintain data in whatever format is best suited, as long as HTML 
is delivered to the client. Yet it is also an HTML issue, because the document 
author risks losing the benefit of structured editors to maintain the documents, 
hust as they are becoming available.

Previously, servers such as the NCSA one used html like syntaxes which is fine 
if you are dealing with a few simple documents and editing the html by hand. 
Validating the resulting files involves fetching them with a client so that what 
is sent can be checked. This decoupling is not a good idea IMHO. Suppose the 
client is also an HTML editor, which would be handy; it is difficult to put the 
revised document back onto the server.

There is also the overhead of the server having to parse the document to include 
the boilerplate, every time the document is fetched.

I would prefer to see a different solution, whereby each document is complete 
and compliant on the server, which eases maintenence and removes the need for 
per-GET server side parsing. I would rather see a makefile type system that 
holds the dependencies. After you have done some work on your server, just make 
all [and then do a vos release on the . directory in afs ;-) ] 

If files are stored with their includes already included, this requires the
start ands end tags of included sections to be marked in some way. Perhaps 
processing instructions <?included> or something? [Ducks, gets flamed by SGML 
gurus].

Comments solicited.

Depends on how the server is connected to the net. My vision is to have
this server used on lots of personal machines running Windows, probably
tied in via PPP/SLIP connections. At least till ISDN gets past the
chicken-and-egg stage. Years, in other words. Connections could be more
like 10 seconds and up.

Developer's choice.

I chose to return a "too busy" message because I felt that the user on the
other end is entitled to a prompt, rational explanation as to why the
request wasn't satisfied. Creating a secondary queue (a queue of incoming
connections waiting to complete) is prolonging the inevitable. That queue
can run out (most sockets packages can queue 4-5, I believe). 

If the user gets back some obscure "connection refused" message, he's gonna
think maybe the server's broken, the network is broken, his client is
broken, the URL is broken, he is broken, who knows?  I hate that. Kinda
like "SYNTAX ERROR".

My approach tries its hardest to deliver a rational, easy to understand
alert message, and do it quickly so the incoming connection requests won't
pile up to the network package's limit and cause an ugly network failure
message to be delivered to the client.

	Hi,

	I'm a beginner into NCSA Mosaic for X 2.0!

	I've built and installed Mosaic. right.

	I launch the gui, and an error occurs:

	Requested document (URL
	http:/www.ncsa.edu....) could not 
	be accessed.

	The information server either is not accessible or is refusing
	to serve the document to you.

	Whenever I put another URL to open, 
	ex:
	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-on-version-2.0.html

	the error is always the same.
        -----------------------------

	Could you explain me how NCSA Mosaic works and what happened
	with my own.

Subject: Redistribution of HTML 2.0 Comments

From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 1986


This is becoming quite a headache... I have attempted to distinguish
between comments sent personally to me, and comments sent to www-talk
etc. which can be redistributed.

The result is, for example,
	Joe submits comments X, Y, and Z

	I respond to joe's message, and file it under "comments
		to fold in"

	Fred notices some of the same things joe noticed, but
	because Joe only sent his comments to me, I couldn't
	make them publicly available, so Fred didn't see them.
	He comments on X, Z, and T.


So I have added the following notice to 
http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/index.html

Review and Publication Process
==============================

The WWW technology will probably be moderated by an international
consortium in the future, but since the need for this document is
immediate, it will be published as an SGML Open Technical Report. An
SGML Open technical committee is forming. Contact Dan Connolly
<connolly@hal.com>, or Yuri Rubinsky, <yuri@sq.com> for details.

The document will be publicly available throughout the review process. 

We are trying to set up a publicly available archive of the review
comments. Currently, a WIT discussion area and a hypermail archive of
www-html are candidates.

When the public archive mechanism becomes stable, I intend to upload
my collection of comments on the HTML spec to that archive. And in
general, to prevent duplicate comments on similar issues, I reserve
                                                          +++++++++
the right to publicly redistribute all comments sent to me regarding
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
the HTML 2.0 spec. I will use discretion in making old messages
++++++++++++++++++
available without the expressed consent of the author, but in the
future, consent will be implictly given just by commenting on the HTML
2.0 document. If you have sent me comments on the HTML 2.0 document
that you don't want made public, please let me know.

It appears that the decision to remove the META element was made
without looking at all the evidence. I'll have to stick it back in
somewhere.

Somebody needs to come up with:

	1. Edits to the spec to completely describe current practice
	w.r.t the META element.

	2. Several test cases showing good and bad usage of META
	(including errors, etc.) for inclusion in the test suite that
	accompanies the 2.0 document.

If this task is left to me, it will happen slowly, if at all.

You seem to be intimately familiar with the subtleties of the META
element. You are invited to write up the specification and submit test
cases.

You should check out Hypermail at

  http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/hypermail.html

which has managed a threaded HTML archive of www-talk since last fall.
It finds URLs, does some fancy matching on reply-to cues for the threading,
alternately organizes by subject, etc.

First, I suggest you redirect your query to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu, as
per the documentation:

Second, might I ask what led you to believe that www-talk was an
appropriate forum for your question? You are not the first to post
"Mosaic customer support" questions to www-talk (though I wouldn't
mind if you were the last ;-)

I'm curious to know what pieces of information out there lead folks to
believe that when they can't get Mosaic installed and working
properly, they should send mail to www-talk! I'd like to get such
documents revised to point to the Mosaic support forums.

Dan


p.s. How'd I do this time, guys? I think I kept my cool pretty good.

p.p.s To the www-talk list maintainers, and anybody who has a pointer
to www-talk: could we PLEASE make this info about who to contact for
Mosaic installation issues part of the standard blurb returned from
subscription requests?

Will do.  Thanks for the pointer.

Does it figure out signatures?  That's one that I haven't tackled yet.
Without some markup (at least <pre>), sigs generally become meaningless.

My real goal is the collaborative stuff; getting the lists into HTML was
just an enabler.

I believe a fundamental difference between the 500 and 503 error response
is that the 503 response is machine readable regardless of any extra text
or html the server might return with the response as content. That is, a
client or proxy that receives a 503 message knows that the remote server is
currently unavailable because it is too busy. If you just wanted a human
readable response, then a 500 response would suffice as long as the Web
client displayed that message to the user, not all clients do.

While, I don't wish to create a separate server response for every
eventuality (Henrik's point is well taken) I do believe that we need some
way of conveying machine readable semantics in the server response as a
fundamental piece of quality of service.

Since the headers are currently a flat information space, the obvious thing
to do is create a new header response for something like a busy remote
server. Perhaps the guideline for adding a new response should be whether
making the response machine readable makes any sense versus just displaying
a response to the user which requires them to take some action. This
implies that clients always display a 5xx response to the user if an
automatic action is not possible. This fits with our current model for
response codes in the 2xx, 3xx, and 4xx classes as well.

 I'm in the wrong place. I'm a technical writer who wanted to know
 a little bit about WWW so I subscribed to WWW-TALK only to find that
 I am in way over my head. I've been trying to unsubscribe for a week
 now without success.

 How do I unsubscribe?

 Thanks for your assistance in this matter. And I apologize for
 interrupting the dialogue here with my request.

Indeed, it is quite hard under the current scheme.

But people don't (generally) want to jump to arbitrary points in text --
they want to jump to points which have *meaning* and that meaning can often
be expressed within an encompassing scope.

For example -- Go to the chapter on fir trees, or Go to the picture of the
engine.

Positional markers are completely luzing in that whenever you change the
text, your markers go to heck.  It would be nice to have markers that could
survive across versions of docs if their (intended) targets survived.
Additionally, positional tags presuppose that you got to the material via a
particular path, which is antithetical to the basic tenets of hypertext.

[Bet you didn't think you could be accused of sacrilege in this discussion :]

It seems like a useable way to do sub-document reference would be to
implement some form of tag on HTML markers so that they could be pointed at.
Servers could then send back parts of docs, rather than just blasting whole
schmears down the pike.

Just limiting it to HTML docs for now, it'd be relatively easy to reference
and obtain only parts of documents via the <a name=""> anchor.  I for one
though would have to use the name tag differently - right now I use it
to signify the beginning of a part from a multi-part document, whereas 
instead it should contain the entire part itself.  For example:

Right now in http://www.wired.com/Etext/1.3/departments/street.cred.html:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2><a name="vending">Internet Vending Machines</a></h2>

In the mid-1970s some brilliant student at Carnegie Mellon University got
tired of trudging down many flights of stairs from his computer terminal
to get a soda from a basement vending machine. By some law of the
universe, the machine was always out of his favorite variety whenever he
was most thirsty. So he hacked up a network connection to the vending
contraption. Now, before he made the long trip down, he would e-mail it to
see which sodas were available. 

(more)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

should be instead:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="vending">

Also, one could specify "don't follow includes", if they wished.

Subject: Proposal: WIT over USENET or Mail
Date: Thu, 09 Jun 1994 12:58:13 -0500
From: "Daniel W. Connolly" <connolly@hal.com>
content-length: 2708


I have an urgent need for the kind of services provided by the WIT
system (see http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/WIT/User/Overview.html),
but I believe that we should deploy this application on top of
existing collaborative applications: USENET news and Internet Mail.


For the purpose of the HTML 2.0 review, I suggest we use the www-html
list and a hypermail archive (I got wind that one is in the works).

	*** To the www-html maintainers: can the list processor
	be changed to stop repeating headers? Especially MIME
	related headers. In the future, I'd like to be able to
	process an archive of html documents sent to www-html,
	but witht the current list set-up, they get munged.
	This is better than when they got deleted, but... ***

Alternatively, if somebody wants to set up a special list just
for the HTML 2.0 discussion (with a hypermail archive, of course)
I'd be happy to use that in stead.

I would like to be able to create WIT-style views of the archive of
this discussion, so we should adopt some convention for expressing the
topic/proposal/argument structure in RFC822 headers. See below for
details...

Why not just use WIT over HTTP? WIT over HTTP has no privisions for
scalability. Even under the current load, it is unresponsive and
faulty.

Here are the features I think we need, and how they map to
the HTTP, internet-mail, and USENET mechanisms:

Feature		HTTP			Mail		News

Subscribe	POST (authenticated	subscription	edit .newsrc

Good question - when I say "view source", does it show <include
src="blah.html">, or simply the included HTML code itself?  If just
the HTML code itself, how should the user be able to tell how this
included piece was referenced?

We should broaden this to address the whole notion of server-side
includes.  One the one hand it would be very nice to have some
standardized format for this, so I don't have to worry about all the
includes in my documents being tied to a specific server
implementation.  On the other hand, this is an issue that might be
better addressed at the server level - for example, all our articles
have a server-included copyright attached, and relying upon the
browser to include the copyright isn't good enough.

One idea is to leave server-side includes as they are, but allow
people to do as suggested above, a generic <include src="URL"> 
directive, and when the inclusion of more text is involved, the
browser commentizes the <include> tag, i.e. <!-- include src="URL" DONE -->
before the included text. (perhaps an <!-- end inclusion --> at the end)
Yet another way to approach it might be along the lines of
a MIME multi-part message, which we'll hopefully see support for in
browsers soon.

  Well, adding an attribute, or perhaps using an element as a
  marker, could be very nice, except that you have to maintain
  the identifiers in some way. Positional markers lose only if
  you assume that the URL's using them are static. In most 
  situations where sub-document naming is desired, it is quite
  feasible to generate the relative sub-document addresses on
  the fly. For example, when a user opens a "book", a TOC could
  be sent over. The TOC would contain section titles with URL's
  using a relative address, generated on the fly, in the hyperlink
  to a lower level. One advantage to such a scheme is that it allows
  quick access to the particular element in the SGML tree that
  you want.

  Of course, another way would be if would could simply type in
  some thing like:

    "book about fir trees chapter dealing with pollen"

  rather than a URL....

It's not a stupid question -- Mosaic's user interface is not
very intuitive in this area. I've added the following note
to the index.html page for the release materials.

Mosaic Technical Support Note
-----------------------------

To download the postscript and/or tar file: 

 1. Choose "Load To Local Disk" from the Options Menu 
 2. Select the desired anchor 
 3. Mosaic transfers the bits, prompts for a filename 
 4. Enter a filename to save the data 
 5. Don't forget to turn of "Load To Local Disk"

As mentioned here earlier today, there's mine at:

<a href="http://198.92.133.3/menus/6581.htm">WWW-talk</a>

... which does more formatting and somewhat different style of threading
than HyperMail.

and HyperMail at:

... which does a better job (for now) of providing date ranges, such as
"recent" messages.

I don't have listserv abilities, but I'd be happy to do the archive.

WIT is taking a stab at representation of dissent, which is a key to
collaborative processes, but it only starts to accomplish that.  Some sort
of collaborative filtering and archiving is important, too.

Unfortunately, I'm working in a Mac environment because I'm prototyping
with HyperCard.   I'm afraid that leaves me somewhat out of the mainstream,
though.  However, I just nabbed a copy of the Mac flavor of Perl, so
perhaps I can pretend to be in the Unix loop, after all.

Unfortunately, statelessness immediately becomes an issue as soon as you
introduce the concepts of subscribing and new messages on the server side.
There are a lot of reasons not to do so... but I don't want to rekindle
that discussion.  I'll just suggest that if we want to have something
working *soon* those states need to be saved at the client.  That's the
Usenet model, too.

I'm trying to accomplish most everything you describe, but without making
any changes to the server.  Clients could make it easier by providing
people a means to save the states, though.  I suspect that whatever I
create will require the user to remember to save his or her last page.

In any event, I'm very happy to participate in this sort of endeavor.  I
intend to broaden it beyond narrative information (news, mail lists, etc.)
to archival and faceted information retrieval.

You'll see that on one of my menu pages:

http://198.92.133.3/menus/8256.htm

There's a placeholder for "Nick's Picks," which is where I'll be
maintaining a list of my favorite recent messages.  I'd like to enable a
few other people to do the same, remotely, especially people with a strong
point of view that's different from mine.

    But people don't (generally) want to jump to arbitrary points in text --
    they want to jump to points which have *meaning* and that meaning can often
    be expressed within an encompassing scope.

The point of have named position locator types is to allow them to be extended
trivially to other available naming conventions.

Of course, the naming junk you add the more resolution problems you create.

Best to have KISS first, then full NLP second.

I don't know who brought this up, and I've only skimmed over these
messages.

This business of refering to parts of things has been done by the
HyTime standard committee. Please read what they have to say before
making up your own system. You might find some stuff you can use.

I would guess that all you need to do is pick and choose from the
hytime loc idioms. In fact, I bet if you posted to comp.text.sgml with
a bunch of made-up idioms, Elliot Kimber would explain how to spell
those idioms in a HyTime conforming way (or several such ways) within
48 hours.

You might not like the way they spell things -- they're very verbose.
But when you consider the fact that once you've spelled it the HyTime
way, you probably won't have to translate it to another syntax for 10
years or so (and by that time, there will be tools to do it for you)
it starts to make sense.

The more HyTime technology you borrow, the more WWW will be able to
benefit from other resources applied to HyTime technology (which isn't
much now, but I expect it will be soon).

Don't make the mistake of ignoring this significant body of knowledge.

Dan

p.s. Unfortunately, there's not much info avalable on the net
about HyTime. The best pointer I can give is:

	ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/HyTime

Poke around elsewhere in 

	ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML

for variously related bits of info.

I tried it and it took me ten times as long to use it as to write
ordinary email.  Specifically, having to navigate slows me down,
and (top of my list) is that the text input area fills up as
you type; then you have to scroll down.  

I posted a response and thought I confirmed that it was registered
(I saw the reverse-video X and the title), but went back and
didn't see it.  (this is in the HTML discussion)

I agree, the idea is good, but the implementation is too clumsy
to be practical if we can use email instead.

It is a little bit harder to use but what is going to happen when we have
1500 email messages on this topic?  Who is going to organize all the
thoughts so that we could ever hope to go back over it all and apply the
information over the long term.  I believe that we need this information
to be structured very much like WIT is doing for us.

I think WIT is a very good idea and I think we *should* use it,
even if it costs a little bit up front.

BTW: I think an email interface into WIT would be pretty easy to
accomplish (using message-id's to track follow-ups and special
headers for opening new topics).

In response, I have to remark that only a human could organize the
*content* of 1500 messages anyway, and WIT doesn't improve on
properly labelled email in that regard.

I have to wonder why we would ever really want to 
archive 1500 email messages on a single topic - 
sociological studies aside.  It's kind of like 
recording all the conversations at the coffee pot.  
What happens when there are 1500 TOPICS?  

I know, I know, its nice to be able to search the
old stuff, but we don't try to save every piece
of information we come in contact with.  

At some point, you hope that information gets filtered
and condensed - not just organized and archived.  So, 
how does one add this to functionality to a system like WIT?  

Organization is a very important first step towards
filtering.  But, I doubt that anyone will really
want to read THIS EMAIL message ten years from now,
even if it's part of a system like WIT:)  So, how
would it get filtered out?

Keith.

Would you care to elaborate? I've looked at using SGML text entities
in this regard, and I've never come up with a workable proposal.

How do you represent entity structure across the wire? Send SDIF
across? Or do you have to do multiple transactions to get the various
entites?

I'd be interested to see a complete proposal for integrating the SGML
entity manager into the WWW distributed system. I expect it will
happen eventually, but we need specifics to get started.

But really, I don't think the SGML entity manager is a good solution
to the various problems such as aggregating multi-node documents for
printing, etc. I think HyTime abstractions _are_ sufficiently powerful,
and if I ever get out from under this HTML 2.0 review mess, I'll write
it all up.

Absolutely!  I know my client doesn't because it passes the response code
between routines as a number and saves it for later referral.
For my application, the actual text response is useless.

That brings up a question I was grappling with yesterday...

I am building the start of a generic WWW library for Perl (i.e. given
any URL and method name, it will perform that method using that URL's
scheme and return the response as if it was an HTTP response).  The library
will start with support for HTTP and FILE and more schemes will
be added (collaboratively, I hope) over time.

The question is:  what error code should be passed back if a particular
scheme has not yet been implemented?  This is similar to the
"501 Not Implemented" response from a server, but it needs to be clear
that the error is due to a limitation of the client.

Currently, I am using "601 Not Implemented".  Would 101 be better?
Should there be a block of numbers set aside for internal client responses?
How do other clients handle this?

A few things that will help this:

1) A "gardener" who prunes the tree as needed - either by directing
questions appropriately, taking sub-sub-sub-topics and returning them to
the main level when they've deviated sufficiently from the main topic,
etc.  It'll be a while, at least it seems to me, before the sculpting of
the information can be automated and managed to the point where it can be
done by an intelligent agent or script.  Moderation, if done correctly,
can be a Very Good Thing. 

2) Seal of Approvals - instead of being able to merely "agree" and
"disagree", users can apply "approvals" and "disapprovals" to
any post they read.  No comment to be left, just a general sign of
support or an indication by the reader that this is a Good post.
Then, users can index information according to how many seals have
been applied (per unit of time, perhaps), and arbitrary users's
approvals could be given arbitrary weights.  I.e., I could ask the
server to organize the threads according to how well liked that
thread was by Tim Berners-Lee, or how well disliked they were by
David Sternlight.

None of these, of course, solves the central issue, which is one of
scalability.  Maybe we're attacking this issue wrong - maybe it'd be
better to hack on the NNTP protocol and clients to allow tree-like threads
and hypertext links everywhere.  On the other hand, is the paradigm of
20000 newsgroups distributed uniformly over 20000 machines necessarily 
better than 20000 newsgroups, each on one machine to itself?  Do
caches make this question moot?

Interesting times ahead.

WIT imposes a hierarchal structure up front.  Email is basically flat
because people don't use it right (even me until now).

> properly labelled email in that regard.
Your email wasn't "properly labelled" because it did not contain a standard
References: line to reference the previous message.  Care to guess what
percentage of email is "properly labelled"? -- Try something like 6 out
of the last 2032 messages to www-talk!!!!

So please explain to me how we are going force everyone to suddenly
start "properly labeling" their email.  I suppose we could make the
listsever reject all improperly labeled email.  That would at least
reduce the traffic on this list :-)

News does a little bit better, at least the references are usually added
by the posting software.  I think it could be used if the news reading
software was more clever (threaded newsreaders are close but not quite).

Check the www-talk archive, 1500 messages is only about 5 months of mail
(@ 10 messages/day).

The main answer to your other point (how to extract information from the
data) in this case is that most of the data in the HTML WIT area will get
processed into the SPEC (and then of course you could have links from the
SPEC to the WIT areas where that topic was discussed).

    I have to wonder why we would ever really want to 
    archive 1500 email messages on a single topic - 
    sociological studies aside.  It's kind of like 
    recording all the conversations at the coffee pot.  
    What happens when there are 1500 TOPICS?

Not so.  When you are capturing typed links you are building a knowledge
representation of sorts.  As the ratio of links to opaque structures declines,
there is more and more that you can do with it automatically.  Recall that the
goal is to reduce transactions costs for people by automating as much as
possible by means of elegant designs or smart programs.

A well-structure design discussion with supersedes links becomes the
documentation for the design.  The more complex the design, the more
individual decisions and the more debates about which way to commit and why.

Current email archives for high volume lists or newsgroup are just too hard to
cope with for people with real jobs.

    It is a little bit harder to use but what is going to happen when we have
    1500 email messages on this topic?  Who is going to organize all the
    thoughts so that we could ever hope to go back over it all and apply the
    information over the long term.

    In response, I have to remark that only a human could organize the
    *content* of 1500 messages anyway, and WIT doesn't improve on
    properly labelled email in that regard.

Do you have a mail reader that allows you to link messages according to
logical RELATIONS between them?  This is what you get from REAL hypertext and
this is what WIT is starting to do.

Secondly, we talking about many individual humans linking their own
contribution.  The main problem will be interlinker (intercoder) reliability.

Yesterday, I decided that I'm going to have some buttons that let people
vote on the importance of archiving messages.  They might be:

* Not worth archiving

* Moderately worth archiving

* FAQ - definitely archive!

* Archive under a different topic

The last one is to alert me, the human, to look at the subject before archiving.

How's that sound?  I'll see if I can implement this tonight...  The
buttons, anyway.  I'm not sure how fast I can wire the results into the
archiving mechanism.

This is a parallel processing solution.  All of you work in parallel to
keep my archives in good shape... ;-)  Oh, they're your archives, too.

By the way, I have uncovered yet another network problem here.  I'm not
sure if it's my own net or my provider's, but it looks like ACKs are
getting lost before they get back here, which is causing timeouts on
anything that exceeds the TCP window size.  I'm working on it, but you may
experience delays and incomplete transmissions until I find a cure.

Hmmm... I would question the wisdom of running a service popular enough

Making explicit "too busy" messages has potential problems too, of course,
since those messages themselves take some load (probably an appreciable
fraction of the load of an ordinary request, since most documents are
generally fairly short and the request with all its accept headers can get
rather lengthy.)

It is, of course, inevitable that users will start clicking on "reload"
over and over to get past the "too busy" message given the high turnover of 
sessionless HTTP, this is actually a fairly reasonable thing to do.
Eventually someone will design a client that does it automatically.
Then what?

Yup.  But I'd rather see the data a little late than a note to that effect.

But if people are in a specific domain they should see

Is there a way to display different text/links depending on

There is currently an IETF working group on IAFA (Internet Anonymous
FTP Archives). We are using it heavily for out FTP archive and have
up to now about 2250 such files. I havs a little perl script that uses
this information and automatically generates (more or less) nice
looking directory indexes.
You may take a look at
    http://www.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/cgi-bin/archive_access/pub/comp/X11/contrib/clients/00-index.html
or
    http://www.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/cgi-bin/archive_access/pub/comp/platforms/00-index.html
    (for the last one look into the macintosh or pc subdirectories)

I think however, we shouldn't put all this stuff into the server, but
have other mechanisms generate the info and the server to look out
for special files and use those, like the NCSA http does for files
named index.html

Hello,

thought I saw a message on this before, but didn't find any follow-ups.

How about a MIME-header element Server-Name: ?
The client would send it to the server and tell it the hostname
part of the URL that is the current request.
This would allow to have ONE server, many logical areas and
with some CNAMEs still the advantage of "simple" URLs like
http://www.host1.domain1/ and http://www.host2.domain2/ both
pointing to the same server but different logical areas.

I think this will also be important for service providers that
manage several WWW areas for several companies on one machine and
with one server.

Shouldn't be too hard to implement I think. :)

Just to throw in a comment here... it is *absolutely*essential* that
research institutions work together on a strong open standard, and that
we not allow one dominant company to bring in a proprietary standard.
I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I just thought I'd 
reiterate it.  This has to happen SOON.  The bear is breathing down

Not really needed.  Just assign different IP addresses to the different
names and have the server discriminate on that.  I already do this.

Here is a copy of a message I posted recently to the plexus-dev list:

Subject:      HOWTO -- multi-servers

Several people have expressed an interest in having multiple servers
running on the same machine serving different information for different
hostnames.  The following information explains (a little bit anyway)
what you need to do to set that up.

Say I want WWW.BSDI.COM and WWW.JOE.NET to be WWW servers running on the
*same* machine but I want them to export totally different sets of
information.  Now, you could just put all the data in one place and use
simple path names to differentiate between them:
    http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi/index.html
    http://www.joe.net/joe/index.html
But this is unpleasent and we can't have that.  We want to be able to say:
    http://www.bsdi.com/
and get the "right" server.

A solution:

Since the protocol cannot differentiate on the name at this point in the
game you will need to be able to assign multiple IP addresses to the
machine to get this to work (if you have multiple interfaces on the machine
you are all set).  On late-model BSD systems (including BSD/386, plug plug
:-) you can use the alias feature of ifconfig to add another IP address
to an existing interface:
    ifconfig ef0 inet 192.124.139.2             # configure interface
    ifconfig ef0 192.124.139.100 alias          # add an alias

First, make a server directory for the new system.

Then, edit server/plexus and go down to the bind_port routine and
change the "\0\0\0\0" string like so:
                                             # 192.124.139.100
    $this = pack($sockaddr, &AF_INET, $port, "\300\174\213\144"); 

That's it!  Now you have a different server running on that IP address.
And you can still leave the main server running to catch requests to all
other addresses (amazing, isn't it).

Ok, so it's hard coded.  You're smart right, figure out how to add
a command line argument to plexus.  While working on plexus I'll
keep an eye on this feature and see if I can't make it nicer for you
(I have a bunch of ideas, including being able to setup this up in
a single server process using local.conf).

Hmmm.  Given that often 100 times as much person time is spent
reading a document as writing it, slowing down the author for
the sake of extra reader power is not all bad!  :-))

Seriously, I agree that the interface could be easier. Just that
Mosaic isn't as evolved as your favorite mail reader, and also
that WIT is a little cluttered on the output side: a case for
interface refinement: not beyond the wit of man.

We had in mind extra buttons for moderators which would
allow for example documents to be approved or deleted, or just
given raised or lowered "star ratings".  Baiscally, seals of approval.
This would allow one to get a view filtered for timeless value
according to the panel.  The trick is to make it simple to do,
like the argument entry.  It's a going to be a lot easier for the
moderator than having to arrange discussion into a tree. One of
the hopes for WIT was that it would focuss discussion into
a tree, and prevent the sort of ramblings which people sometimes
get into on mail (like the time that the hypertext interface
discussion got into blueberry picking -- remember that? That
was back when we had the 1906A -- by the way has anyone got a
WWW client for a 1906A?... etc etc etc)

I am as frustrated by the lack of an effective tool for managing online
conferences such as this.  Threaded news is a giant serial tube, and email
is cacaphony; sometimes I get the feeling like I am at a loud cocktail
party- there are five loud drunks over in the corner talking incessantly,
a guy pulling at my sleeve to ask if I could recommend a home computer for
his daughter (apologies to mosaic preemies), and every once in a while,
out of the corner of my ear, I catch a snatch of a discussion that I am
vitally, critically interested in. 

Isn't there SOME alternative to the technology we are using? I take it WIT
fails in some regard, but it seems as though HTML should provide the
foundation for something like an n-dimensional (or at least hierarchical)
threaded reader, but there are issues. It is more than academic; not only
could www-talk use a better tool, but at The EarthWeb Project we are
keenly interested in implementing new technologies of web conferences for
EarthWeb. 

If someone would tell me where to go (watch it), I'd gladly take this 
discussion somewhere else. Let me know if you want to hear more.

BTW: could someone direct me to more information on WIT?

It depends on how it is organized; if discussions (such as this one) 
formed a clear or loosely connected taxonomy, an editor in the future 
could lop off the branch. A future user/researcher might get an error 
message: "Discussion branch terminated/archived".

  Dan,

  I understand and appreciate your viewpoint (out of scope questions   
  seem to be a problem on every list I subscribe to). I believe your   
  point has been raised on this list several times in the last couple  
  of weeks. For those that missed it, the comp.infosystems.www news-   
  group was mentioned as a good place to start.

  However, since I don't have the time, manpower or ???? to get news   
  up and going I would like to know if there is any other (non news)   
  forum for people new to, and / or trying to install, Mosaic ??

  Thanks / greg / ghardison@mcdermott.com

Is it too late to consider changing the HTTP protocol to allow a full URL
in GET requests?  In retrospect it seems a mistake to have GET just pass
the URL fragment following the host name part.  As long as we are having
URLs stand in for URNs (which we are) then we should pass them around
complete.  Then we would have requests like:

	GET http://host.domain/docid HTTP/1.0

(or maybe GET http://host.domain/docid HTTP/2.0
       or GETURL http://host.domain/docid HTTP/1.0)
rather than:

	GET /docid HTTP/1.0

In addition to allowing easier merging of servers, this would also make 
accessing a proxy server use the same protocol as accessing a regular
server.

We can upgrade most of the servers before modifying the clients to send
full URL requests.  This would be also good practice for the change that
will be required when we eventually start using real URNs.

Most people don't want to muck with reconfiguring their system
to have alias IP addresses.  I know I don't, and neither do our
local system administrators.

I think we need to try to focus on what the exact nature of the
problems of WIT are and generaly try to get a bit more constructive.
I don't think that anyone has suggested that it is perfect. Until
you have something to play with it is difficult to know what you want.

The first stage then is we should play with it.

I had a go at an email hypertexter and gateway. Also properly hypertexting
news. Both are a big win in themselves but what is still missing is a
framework for discussion.

It is quite easy to imagine a set of conventions that could interface
mail and news to WIT. In fact they are the same thing if you think about 
it. News is simply an email with 20 million recipients, most of whome will
file it as junk and delete unread.

How about:-

1) Something to do with the recipient...
2) Something to do with the subject line...
3) Something to do with embedding anchors in text...

A gateway could easily file this under the WWW-TALK WIT discussion group.
area. The topic would be WIT, it has a hypertext link to Tony's email.

What we need is a convention for typing that link as an "agree" or a 
"disagree" link. It would be easy enoug to modify the mail/news system to
give this capability. Instead of "reply to" or "post" we have a disagree 
and agree buttons producing the lines:-

Disagree <7396@cernvm.cern.ch> 
Agree <7396@cernvm.cern.ch>

These could be picked up. Alternatively we could add in a <DISAGREE> 
psuedo tag...

The c.i.www newsgroup has just split into three:
	comp.infosystems.www.misc   
	comp.infosystems.www.providers  -  Server stuff
	comp.infosystems.www.users      -  Client stuff (Mosaic!)

Send Mosaic queries to comp.infosystems.www.users, where they
will join thousands of others...

    Is it too late to consider changing the HTTP protocol to allow a full URL
    in GET requests?  In retrospect it seems a mistake to have GET just pass
    the URL fragment following the host name part.  As long as we are having
    URLs stand in for URNs (which we are) then we should pass them around
    complete.  Then we would have requests like:

	    GET http://host.domain/docid HTTP/1.0

I second this motion.  However, I would note the spec could continue to allow
url fragments that would just be interpreted as defaulting scheme to HTTP and
host and port to the server and current port.

    (or maybe GET http://host.domain/docid HTTP/2.0
	   or GETURL http://host.domain/docid HTTP/1.0)
    rather than:

	    GET /docid HTTP/1.0

    In addition to allowing easier merging of servers, this would also make 
    accessing a proxy server use the same protocol as accessing a regular
    server.

Good abstraction collapse.

    We can upgrade most of the servers before modifying the clients to send
    full URL requests.  This would be also good practice for the change that
    will be required when we eventually start using real URNs.

Backward compatible under the defaulting scheme, assuming a client that wanted
a host other than the default was capable of specifying the full url.

    I think we need to try to focus on what the exact nature of the
    problems of WIT are and generaly try to get a bit more constructive.
    I don't think that anyone has suggested that it is perfect. Until
    you have something to play with it is difficult to know what you want.

Right on the money.  Rome wasn't built in day.

    The first stage then is we should play with it.

Exactly, and make constructive suggestions for improvements.

    I had a go at an email hypertexter and gateway. Also properly hypertexting
    news. Both are a big win in themselves but what is still missing is a
    framework for discussion.

Can these be interfaced to WIT so that people can comment on WWW-talk and
friends?

    It is quite easy to imagine a set of conventions that could interface
    mail and news to WIT. In fact they are the same thing if you think about 
    it. News is simply an email with 20 million recipients, most of whome will
    file it as junk and delete unread.

The main difference is the propagation pattern.

There remains the issue of maintaining copies of messages.  With WWW, one
could progate URLs (URNs) and headers via NNTP, and users/sites could resolve
and cache them, according to the relevance for their site.

    How about:-

    1) Something to do with the recipient...

Track conversations by senders and recipients.

    2) Something to do with the subject line...

Track conversations by heuristic subject line matching.

    3) Something to do with embedding anchors in text...

Identify embedded email addresses and URLs in the body.

Look for message IDs, in-reply-to headers and try to thread together.

Support keywords and maintain an index via keywords.

Provide a WAIS interface to the message archive.

Get some statistics hackers to match messages based on word frequency
centroids.

    A gateway could easily file this under the WWW-TALK WIT discussion group.
    area. The topic would be WIT, it has a hypertext link to Tony's email.

Sounds good.

    What we need is a convention for typing that link as an "agree" or a 
    "disagree" link. It would be easy enoug to modify the mail/news system to
    give this capability. Instead of "reply to" or "post" we have a disagree 
    and agree buttons producing the lines:-

    Disagree <7396@cernvm.cern.ch> 
    Agree <7396@cernvm.cern.ch>

What about as links header which is a sequence of link-type, [message-id or url]?

    These could be picked up. Alternatively we could add in a <DISAGREE> 
    psuedo tag...

This might be helpful for people who can't hack their message headers.

Shouldn't a message header give the content-type of the message? e.g. text/html?

Can your interface handle MIME multipart messages?

WRT to NNTP as a transport, would it make sense to have an HTML/WWW hierarchy
where all the postings are marked up in html?

I agree that a structured discussion forum could be helpful, but only  
if it has the right structure.  In particular, I don't think that the  
fixed-depth "agree/disagree" structure that WIT currently tries to  
impose is conducive to constructive collaboration.  The  
aritrary-depth branched "threading" structure that has evolved for  
netnews seems more natural.

For example, was what I just said an "agree" or a "disagree"?  It was  
neither, of course, and so are most messages.  I just don't think  
this is a helpful distinction.

I've thought about this sort of thing over the last few months... and
mainly I've concluded that it's going to take a lot of iteractive UI design
to see what people will use.  But I think we can predict that "Agree" and
"Disagree" are overly reductionist.  One of the problems of the mass media
today is that it imposes this sort of polarization on issues.  Let's not
encourage that.  The real opportunity on the net (a/k/s problem) is to
create ways to communicate multiple points of view.

I'd like to steer this discussion back toward the kinds of open HTTP and
HTML features that will support user interfaces that will allow us to try a
lot of collaborative tools.  It's wonderful that WIT is underway; I hope to
see many more things like it.  The best thing that could happen is that the
standard and the tools encourage people to experiment with new
collaborative information navigation systems.

To wit (pun barely intended), I'd like to see some sort of open structure
for buttons (and other UI feedback features -- lists, outlines,
thermometers etc.) enabled, so that "Republican, Democrat, Socialist,
Libertarian, Neo-Nazi, Nerd, etc." points of view can be managed as easily
as "Agree,Disagree."

It seems clear to me that user feedback mechanisms should support both
absolute and relative ranking systems.  I've seen a lot of "rank every
message from 1 to 10" ideas tossed around, but I find it much easier to
rank messages (or the day's news, etc.) relative to other messages.

Anyway, what I'm babbling on about here is really the need for an open
structure that will encourage a lot of trial and error in the models for
collaborative information navigation.

A final thought -- I like the notion of allowing groups of people to create
"cells" of linked documents that can come from anywhere.  Within each
"cell," we can use tried and true IR tools -- hierarchical browsers, etc.
To link lots and lots of such cells, new tools are essential because of the
implicit multi-dimensional, well, web-like nature of the beast.  This
mailing list is part of such a cell (I call it a virtual forum) that I'm
building on my server, which is a gathering point for news, messages,
archives, etc. relating to the Web, libraries, collaborative information
navigation and the other stuff that interests me.

HTML 3.0 (htmlplus?  The one Dave Raggett's working on)
provides for:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div2 id=vending>
<h2>Internet Veding Machines</h2>
[...]
</div2>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a little cleaner: you don't need to put
an entire section inside the <A> element (which 
isn't even legal right now,  and would significantly
complicate the content model if it were.)

I like that scheme better; <A> is *only* used as a link
source, and any other element may be desginated as a link
destination by adding an 'ID' attribute.  This is also closer 
to the HyTime model of linking.

<AGREE>

I like the idea of taking the NNTP model and munging it. Perhaps what we
should try to do is to layer the system. We have two very separate problems:-

<PROPOSE>
1) The structure of News is unwieldy and will become more so with more	
	users. Currently we are about the size of Luxembourg. Within five 
	years we should be the size of Great Britain.

	The bigger the city, the more drunks you find in the pubs.

2) The distribution of news is wastefull. Every site gets everything. 
	What I would like to do is to prune down the NNTP system to a
	two stage system:-

	1) An NNTP backbone 
	2) Cache Relays hanging off the backbone.


	Starting from the network topology we cut down the network to
	a logical system of sites, minimizing the duplicate paths etc.
	Main hub sites of the internet such as CERN, MIT etc would 
	carry the full service.

	The sub-sites would run stripped down service. They would
	typicaly subscribe to a number of sites and for the others
	take "headers only" service. Instead of getting the bodies
	they would get only heads. These could be compressed to save
	even more space.

	When a sub site gets a request for a message not in the cache
	it requests and caches it.

<MY-RIGHT-ANGLE-BRACKET-KEY-HAS-MELTED-]

This system would be IMHO better for almost everyone. Users at leaf sites
would see a slight degredation in response. But there would be more leaf
sites. There would no longer be a need to run expiry in the braindamage
manner of USEnet. If an article has been flushed from the cache simply
ask for a re-send from the hub node. Hub nodes would keep archive systems
which would allow reference to *any* Usenet post *ever*. This would not be
as expensive as it may sound, USEnet on CD is avaliable. A jukebox is not
a prohibitively expensive item. Needless to say cataloging 
alt.binaries.dirty.gifs would not have to be a priority.

We only really need one long term store...

YES YES YES!!!!!

www. hierarchy here we come !!!!

Actualy I think we should create it anyway and gate it to the CERN/MIT link in
the same manner as the cern. hiearchy. The news software could be set to
allow world access to the www hierarchy only. Then we could get rid of these
!@#%&!@#^%#*$ mailing lists.



Before we get carried away though, I hope people realise that whatever our
intentions to create something of use to mankind it will only gain acceptance
when someone discovers how to use it to transport pornography. Perhaps 
<AGREE> and <DISAGREE> is the wrong model, perhaps we should have marks out 
of ten?

But what happens if a posting contains some points I agree with and some
that I disagree with.  This is the most common form of posting in both
mailing lists and on the USENET as far as I'm concerned.  Do I just cut
out each point separately and attach an ``agree'', ``disagree'' or
``ambivalent'' SOAP to them?  Or am I forced to make an overall judgement
of the posting as a whole?  Or split it up into sub-topics, even if they
haven't deviated greatly from the main topic?

Clearly, the most desirable solution is to mark the relevant region (in
whatever way the clinet allows)) and attach the link to the relevant text.

Although more difficult to implement properly on both the front and back ends,
it does what most people want.

Additionally, it tends to focus on the relevant text, zeroing in on what is
important, or a least salient.

What I had in mind was more general than that - keeping in mind that
the main way I want to use this is to narrow the amount of information
I feel compelled to read by subjecting it to a form of peer review.
Maybe then "approve" is a bad term - maybe "recognition"?  

Let's say there was a post which contained points you agreed with and
some you disagreed with.  If you care about the topic, and wish to 
address the points you like and those you didn't, making a followup
post is the best way to communicate that.  But, you would still put
a mark of "recognition" on it, so that when I come through the archives
looking for things you and others thought merited attention, then I
see this post, and your reply.  If it's a subject you have no interest
in, you don't mark it.  If it's another piece of spamming by the law
firm of Canter and Seigal (I can never spell their names right) then
I could even give it a negative recognition, if we found such 
appellations useful.

Traffic here has been heavy and I haven't caught every message, so please 
excuse me if this has been covered, but will the scripts and code in WIT 
ever be made available?

The server I run (http://www.ziff.com/~pcweek/) would be perfect for 
something like this. I wanted readers to be able to voice their opinions 
about our columns  and I've been working on just added the most basic of 
forms to the ends of columns for people to send feedback to the author, but 
something like WIT would be much better.

Subject: Re: Proposal: WIT over USENET or Mail
content-length: 2643


I second the proposal to use Mailing Lists and Usenet as a foundation
for Web-based news groups, and would like to propose several simple
mechanisms that together can provide a smooth integration of the two:

- A general news URL which allows access to any news server on the
	Internet, in the form of "news://nntpserver_address/article".
	Owners of the news group may decide  whether to flood it
	through Usenet (i.e. make it global), and whether to allow
	remote browser access and posting, through standard NNTP/INN
	mechanisms.

- A mechanism in Web browsers which allows posting articles in
	any news group on any news server.  Posting from an article is
	a followup to a thread, and posting from the news group index
	opens a new thread.

- A Newsgroup-Mailing list bidirectional reflector.  The reflector will
	automatically post new mailing list articles to a specified
	news group, and will automatically mail a new news group
	posting to a specified mailing list.


By combining these mechanisms, users can:

- access the newsgroup at the "host" NNTP server through the remote
	"news:" URLs, if they have full Internet access.

- participate in the discussion through mailing lists, 
	if they don't have full Internet access.

- participate in the discussion through their local NNTP server, 
	if the newsgroup is global.

The ability to create local (i.e. non-flooded) newsgroups with global
reach will make the decision to start a new newsgroup much easier.

The Newsgroup-Mailing list reflector will allow individuals who don't
have full Internet access to participate in the discussion, in spite of
the fact that the newsgroup is local.

Once a newsgroup is primarily "Web-oriented", with most reading and
posting done from enhanced Web browsers, features of HTML can be
brought to bear, allowing better indexing, browsing, etc., in the spirit
of hypermail and WIT.  Yet the basic structure should allow "ordinary"
newsreaders access as well.

I believe I remember someone from CERN saying that in these days of
world-wide access the NNTP flooding protocol seems a bit arcane;
perhaps this might offer a migration path towards a more appropriate,
Web-oriented, netnews architecture.

I need a large Web server access log in Common Log Format. It needs to have
data over several weeks, and from a variety of hosts and to a variety of
URLs. 

I am developing a Visual Basic SQL-based stats logger and reporter for the
WIndows httpd server. It is to serve both as a useful application and an
example of using VB to handle CGI scripts that talk to Access
(SQL/Relational) databases.

I don't yet have a permanent live net connection, and therefore have no way
to create such a logfile.

I promise to use thhe log only for testing and to destroy it as soon as I
am finished. 

Please let me know privately if you can help.

That is exactly one reason for WIT to be an improvement.
It forces people to make different points in different
messages.  It would be nice to have a richer system with
semantics within messages but that is not practical yet.
(but with typed links and miem multipart?...)
WIT discourages the "Oh, and by the way" bits.  It is
more of a constraint on writes, to make it more usable for
readers.

Oh, and by the way, I  agree that Seals Of APproaval should
go in -- when Ari is back from Paris maybe.  Maybe without
disapproval, as disapproval without explanation can be
*infuriating*.

This has been discussed on the URI list.  (If it were WIT it would
be easy to refer to.!)  I am against the idea as it is a perversion
of the NNTP protocol for uses which eth HTTP protocol was designed.
You can do the same thing just by running a local HTTP gateway
into a local newsgroup.

I would suggest allowing posting to anything, be it
news article or web article (subject to permission).

These exist.

I haven't followed the URI discussion, and  "perversion" is a loaded
term.  What are the reasons against remote NNTP clients?
And how does an HHTP proxy overcome these reasons?

Sorry, "perversion" is loaded.  I feel that the point of the NNTP
protocol is that it is a global flooding protocol.  It has certain
properties.  If an NNTP server says to you "IHAVE xxxx" you can check
to see whether you have xxxx from any other site, you can pass it on,
you can refer to it just as xxxx.  Either people have that message
or they don't.  Looking at the Message-ID is all you need.

By contast, in a system with private news servers, you would have to
use the full URI of style nntp://host/message-id as a reference
instead.  NNTP doesn't use those URLs.  Not in the "References:", not
in the protocol.

On the other hand, you are just using NNTP to give HTTP
functionality, so why not use HTTP?  That does use URIs,
and has the model of retieval directly or indirectly from a 

home server.

You can run cern-httpd with lines like

	map	/*	news:/*
	
in the config file to allow your local news groups

	news:myorg.canteen.flame
	
to be visible as

	http:/newsgate.myorg.com/myorg.canteen.flame
	
True, you have to write a script if you want to allow posting.
(And you need a client with posting)

We need a status code for internal use in clients and servers when a
connection times out before the transaction is complete.

I implement this in the CL-HTTP server but there is no standard code for use
when writing access logs in Common Logfile Format.

Presumably a 4xx code should suffice.  For now I am using 601.  I am using 6xx
code for any non-standard status codes I need.

I'm currently using 5 minutes as a timeout.  Any thoughts on better timeout
limits?

We should distinguish betweeninternal client codes and codes sent
across the net. The HTTP status codes are sent over the net and
have a significance only in the context of the HTTP transaction.
So for example, if a client requests from a proxy which goes
out to a server, and the connection between the proxy and the
server times  out, then from the point of view of the primary
connection between the client and the proxy, the return code
should be something like

500 Something went wrong: underlying service timed out

with an explanatory message including ifnromation about the
actual error, for diagnostic purposes.  If the proxy has a code
for "timeout", then it would need codes for all the N things
which can happen to underlying services, from core dumps to
ball lightning.

If you want codes in the client locally for passing back the
fact that an HTTP or other protocol has timed out, then the
appropriate thing is the HTError.h system, which allows
a stack of errors to be generated, tracing cause to effect.
Each element on the satck has an error number (which
could be translated into your favourite language message)
and few other bits.  Some of the errors correpond to
HTTP response codes. Others, like HTERR_TIME_OUT, do not.
Sounds like   HTERR_TIME_OUT might be what you want.

I was wondering if the mailto URL could be adapted to support this.
If the mailto link could specify the email headers to use, then the
email could be processed automatically, based on these headers, and
slotted into the hypertext of the discussion.

If this can't be done now, then at least it could go into the HTML 3
specification. What do people think?

[Tim - I didn't put him up to this, but as long as the topic is on the
table.....]  NNTP was invented specifically to reduce the proliferation of
email lists of general interest.  Thus it is preferable to have mail
articles independent of the actual machine where they may reside.  However,
it is still unclear (to me) why the URI syntax must be constrained to prohibit
this knowledge.  In practice, the [host.domain] may be left out 99.99% of the
time, but why artificially contrain it ?

This is certainly a reasonable solution in some places, but there may be
several situations where this is inconvenient or not possible.  This scenario
presumes full-time Internet access, real multi-tasking operating systems,
and httpd-knowledgable users.  For example, this scenario does not work on
a dialup connection under Windows (little hope of httpd proliferation).
For example, I have multiple dialup connections, with multiple news feeds
and near zero control over what daemons execute on the connected host.  There
have been several times I wish I didn't have to restart my browser after
changing its configured news host.

It would seem that it is beyond the scope of HTTP/HTML/URI to enforce
the use of local news feeds.  Perhaps DNS should be extended to resolve
"news" or some other mechanism use for this purpose ?

Is this unconditional ?  What if I have a slow line and a large document ?
If it would time out unconditionally after 5 minutes, then perhaps it
should be an algorithm of document size and transfer rate ?

	Boy,  have you hit on a point there!   Yes,  it's because 
of how your brain works.   Quite different from a computer. 
We remember things with links (like hypertext, I guess) but we 
remember "feelings" about things more than the things themselves. 
This is kind-of like when you remeber reading something somewhere, 
but can't remember the exact text until you remember a context that 
includes things like the smell of the guy smoking a pipe nearby, etc.

I need a large Web server access log in Common Log Format. It needs to have
data over several weeks, and from a variety of hosts and to a variety of
URLs. 

I am developing a Visual Basic SQL-based stats logger and reporter for the
WIndows httpd server. It is to serve both as a useful application and an
example of using VB to handle CGI scripts that talk to Access
(SQL/Relational) databases.

I don't yet have a permanent live net connection, and therefore have no way
to create such a logfile.

I promise to use thhe log only for testing and to destroy it as soon as I
am finished. 

Please let me know privately if you can help.

	I also have fear of WIT:  it wanted me to supply a password. 
Look ... I've already got too many passwords to remember,  so  a) 
I'm not going to use one of my "real" passwords in that context,  and 
b)  I'm not interested in generating YAPW.   Maybe I've misunderstood? 
 
	WIT looks really intersting.   But can we keep the 
development discussion in ordinary e-mail for a while?   Thanks!

The Chicago-Kent College of Law is pleased to announce its addition to the
World Wide Web:  The Chicago-Kent College of Law WWW Server.

The <A HREF="http://www.kentlaw.edu/">Chicago-Kent College of Law</A> is
located at the following URL:

      http://www.kentlaw.edu/

In particular, we have information concerning our law school, an interface
into Chicago-Kent's Electronic Publishing Initiative (under construction),
an interface into The Legal Domain Network, and access to Law Links.

The Legal Domain Network was established by Chicago-Kent College of Law and
Villanova University School of Law to consolidate all substantive legal
discussion on the Internet.  It is fully Wais searchable and NNTP feedable
to law-related organizations.

Law Links represents Chicago-Kent College of Law's effort to consolidate all
law resources on the Internet.  That is, instead of pointing to servers of
information, we are striving to point to the information pieces themselves
without having to go through the intermediate step of connecting to a resource
server.  UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

Please contact me if you have any trouble, questions, or comments.

Thank you.  Larry.

    We should distinguish betweeninternal client codes and codes sent
    across the net.

Clearly.  I'm not dealing with clients at the moment.

    The HTTP status codes are sent over the net and
    have a significance only in the context of the HTTP transaction.
    So for example, if a client requests from a proxy which goes
    out to a server, and the connection between the proxy and the
    server times  out, then from the point of view of the primary
    connection between the client and the proxy, the return code
    should be something like

    500 Something went wrong: underlying service timed out

A little too general to be useful for much of anything.

    with an explanatory message including ifnromation about the
    actual error, for diagnostic purposes.  If the proxy has a code
    for "timeout", then it would need codes for all the N things
    which can happen to underlying services, from core dumps to
    ball lightning.

My immediate problem was the status code to record in the common logfile
format for my server. 500 is overly general.

A bug with numeric codes is that they do not directly encode the error
taxonomy. For examples, see the
http://clinton.ai.mit.edu/code/server/http-conditions.lisp

Are you suggesting two different timeout codes?  One for proxy servers and
another for clients (which we don't advertise)?

In any event, what does the server stuff in the log file when the client times
out?

    Is this unconditional ?  What if I have a slow line and a large document ?
    If it would time out unconditionally after 5 minutes, then perhaps it
    should be an algorithm of document size and transfer rate ?

Sorry, timeouts after the connection is idle for 5 minutes.

Unless I'm way behind here (which is entirely possible) it seems as 
though we are all discussing implementations, without a clear 
understanding of the requirements. I think Dave has a good idea for 
implementing a quick & dirty index on topics, but what are we missing?

Does anyone think it a good idea to come up with a requirements 
document/RFC? Here goes .. In my voluminous spare time IF no one else is 
already working on such a project, I will volunteer to compile a list of 
requirements, so our implementation ideas can be considered in context.

Last week I tried to install WWWWais on www.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
Compilation and installation worked fine ... BUT:

	freewais creates corrupt index-files :-(((

(Happens on version 0.202 und 0.3 ! (with HP-UX 9.01))

The indexing was done by

 	find $top_dir/* -name "*.html" -print | xargs \
 	waisindex -d $index -a -t URL $top_dir $top_url 

whereas the vars are set to:

 	top_dir 	document-root
 	top_url 	URL zum document-root
 	index		Name des Index

The first waisindex was called by "-export" rathen than "-a". 
(This will overwrite an existing index.)

>From the beginning of indexing this warning appears:
 	Warning: couldn't open /usr/proj/infosys/wais-db/html.syn - translation disabled
(Here: $index = /usr/proj/infosys/wais-db/html )
The created index only works for very few words. In most cases freewais doesn`t find
any hits or dumps core :-(

Now I`ve done this before indexing:
 	touch /usr/proj/infosys/wais-db/html.syn
After some time of indexing (does not depent on the order of the indexed files) this
error-message appears:
 	 100: Total word count for dictionary is: 15929
 	  -1: total_word_count not found in dictionary. This is either an error, or the database is old. 0 out of 1

Needless to say that freewais sucks like above :-(

Can anybodey tell me what I`ve done wrong???
I`m using freewais in some other cases where it works fine ...

"Idle" is a funny thing.  In systems with lots of socket buffering, many
small to medium document transfers will allow it to be completely written
to the socket.  The httpd will then hang up in the socket close waiting for
the socket buffers to drain.

If you're fortunate enough to hang in a write (or in a select waiting for it
to be writable), then a reasonable timeout is a function of the socket
buffer size.  Don't forget to factor in the socket buffer size of the client
which, of course, there's no way to know.

Also, what if your httpd is proxying a slow PH or WAIS server ?  These
can easily take 5 minutes with no traffic.  The user may be Buddha :-)

If you get a socket connect with no GET (or similar), then timeout real fast.
If you're already responding to a GET (or similar) then it's a hard question.

Caught between the Scylla of not using the tools ourselves, and the
Charybdis of limiting the discussion to the users of the new tools,
let me risk the redundancy of cross-posting. 

I've appended below the text of a proposal that I recently posted on
WIT. Perhaps, for now, we could cross-post WIT proposals here, and
those interested could continue the discussions on WIT. I apologize in
advance if the subject of my proposal has already been discussed on
this list. In its relatively unstructured current form, I'm having
trouble keeping up with this list.

<H1>We need fine-grained proposals (points).Messages can be sets of points.</H1>
<P>
I suggest that we need very fine-grained proposals (I'll call them
<I>points</I> for now), if we want to support the creation of 
tightly-structured discussions. A typical message would contain a
set of related points, or a set of related arguments to earlier
points. This would satisfy the twin goals of maintaining 
a tightly-structured discussion, and of allowing people to communicate
their ideas in reasonably large units (i.e., it won't force us to
limit our conversational moves to a few lines each).<p>

As evidence for the desirability of this structure, consider how we 
currently implement structured discussions in email and news. We yank
the original message to which we are responding, divide it up into 
small blocks, and attach our point-by-point responses to these blocks.
<p>

I suggest that we formalize this structure in WIT. At a minimum, all
that is required of the implementation is to allow a user to submit
a set of related proposals or arguments. The grouping of these points
into a message should be maintained in the database. This grouping is
orthogonal to the proposal/argument structure.
All that is required of the users is super-human discipline.<p>

P.S. Another facility that I would like to suggest is the
<I>raporteur</I> (summarizer). Although that will be the topic of
another proposal, I mention it here because, as an experiment, I'll
try to maintain 
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/jeremy/wit/points-proposal.html">
a summary of the discussion of this proposal.</A>.

Here's a few (probably not so easy) ones:

        1. Offline composition - unless I missed something, it appears
        that one must be connected semi-live to the various WIT forms
        in order to have a meaningful session.  Of course one could
        cut and paste, but...

        2. Some sort of heirarchical organization - this seems designed
        in, but it might require some human intervention to keep it
        rational.

        3. An email interface - no matter how its designed there will be
        those that can't/won't/don't use it for various reasons.  Maybe
        a script could be written to handle inbound email, HTML-ize it,
        and stuff it into the right place ?  This might also solve other
        silly requirements such as (1) above.

Well, in the Web (tm) there's really no difference between online and
offline composition - when you download a form and fill it out you're not
still connected to the machine from whence it came, so it doesn't matter 
of you take 5 minutes or 5 days to fill it out.  Of course, I'm probably
being pedantic here, and you are referring to using a different kind
of editor for writing the message, in which case I agree it might be
good but that's something that needs to be addressed on the application
level (i.e., how to get one application to dump data to another's input
area).

If it's easy to allow users to collapse trees and move certain posts back
to a top level when the discussion has progressed significantly from the
original topic, then that would be great for most purposes...

I've been debating this in my head many times - if someone doesn't have the
capability to view something on W3, why are they participating in a
discussion about improving it?  I really do not want to come about like a
snob, but it seems analogous to wanting a snail-mail interface to e-mail
mailing lists 10 years ago.  At some point you have to define a lowest
common denominator, and the lower that is the more limited your choices 
are.  

Having said that, I also think it might not be too hard to add.  Presumably
every message posted will have some sort of message-id. WIT makes the ID be a
mirror of its structural location, which is Yet Another thing to improve. 
Anyways, it's not hard to forward all new posts in a given topic to a given
list, and IF the headers are written right and the mail software knows how to
handle them, it could work for the most part seamlessly.  However, I'm not
optimistic about this second part.  Eudora is horrible in responding to the
Reply-To: field correctly.  Pine and Elm seem to handle it fine, but they
are rapidly becoming superceded by PC and Mac-based mailers which have 
their own ideas on what RFC822 really means.  So, receiving mail from a
WIT-like entity isn't too hard, but replying back to it will never be
as reliable as we'd want.

To: www-talk@www0.cern.ch
Subject: WIT functionality
content-length: 1337

As I'm the one who trashed it awhile back, let me offer a few
suggestions for improving the functionality of WIT.

I want to be able to see at a glance whether a discussion has 
advanced (I might want to be notified of a new addition, but
let that pass).  So I want to be able to see *beyond the first
level of choices* to what's beyond, the real content.  One
way to do this is to collapse two levels, providing links to
each, as I did in the main menu of GNN's Whole Internet Catalog.
Here I'd like to be able to see lists of contributions from
the main topic node with at most one click.

And (as I suggested when I mentioned wetware, and others have
mentioned, too) someone has to sort out all the stuff that might
accumulate, whatever he's called.  I want to be able to get 
a view through his prism alongside a view of the whole 
depressing accumulation of messages.

Finally, I want some way to know when an issue has reached a
critical stage of discussion:  proposed, last draft, up for
final approval, and so on.  Naturally, at each of these stages
I want a direct link to the current text of the proposal as
amended.

I'll leave for the future any suggestions about a Robert's Rules
of Order checker.

Regards,

By "connected", I meant locally connected to the Internet, not TCP connected
to the httpd.  Current browser technology does not lend itself to browsing
large, linked chunks and then disconnecting from your local
favorite service provider and fooling around with it, then reconnecting
to the service provider and uploading the (potentially multiple forms).
It all currently presumes a full time (local) Internet connection.  This
may in the future go away with ISDN, but for now, it's a problem for
those that pay by the minute.  Email programs only recently figured this
out.

I'd be more inclined to want to post via email rather than view via email.
One can think of WITing as two tasks - viewing and posting.  Viewing via the
web is the way to go, however W3 client posting technology is still
lagging and (for now) one may wish to post via another means.  I suggested
email since everyone has their own favorite, fuzzy composer.

I like WIT a lot.  But in some ways it is re-inventing NNTP.  I hate to
ask but I will....has anyone considered using private news groups via NNTP
and writing a nice W3 news reader/poster ?  I'm sure there are things that it
might limit it, but perhaps an NNTP extension or two would be a better
path ?  Don't get me wrong - I want a "WIT-like thing", but I'm just thinking
about how it could be more widely used and require less invention.
Using NNTP would require news URL's to handle a hostname, though (Tim - are
you listening ?  :-)

>Eudora is horrible......

I'll spare everyone a mailer war here. :-)

	solo:ESCAPED_SOLO_QUERY			Using a default SOLO centroid
    ex. solo:%3Chuitema,inria,fr%3E?email

	solo://server/ESCAPED_SOLO_QUERY	Using a given server
    ex. solo://champagne.inria.fr:2222/%3Cpays%3E?*

	x500:ESCAPED_SOLO_QUERY			Using a SOLO front end to X.500
    ex. x500:%3Chowes,*michigan*,us%3E?*

	When no query is specified, a FORM is returned.

 We added too, FOR EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSE ONLY:

	urn:USER_FRIENDLY_NAME			Using a SOLO URC centroid
    ex. urn:solo-www%20paper,inria,fr

 Optional environment variables:

	SOLO_DEFAULT		name[:port] of nearest SOLO centroid
	WWW_x500_GATEWAY	URL of nearest SOLO front-end to X.500
	WWW_urn_GATEWAY		URL of nearest SOLO URC centroid

	Default settings are currently:

		SOLO_DEFAULT=pax.inria.fr
		WWW_x500_GATEWAY=x500://champagne.inria.fr:2222/
		WWW_urn_GATEWAY=urn://champagne.inria.fr:2222/

 HTSolo.c was successfully integrated into:

	NCSA's Mosaic for X, version 2.4 (libwww/2.12 modified)
	Lou Montulli's Lynx, version 2.3 (libwww/2.14)

 on a sun4, and we hope that people will try it with other browsers and
servers in proxy mode...

 The distribution directory is:

	http://champagne.inria.fr/Pub/

 Files:

	Mosaic-solo.Z		Mosaic binary for sun4 (-lresolv) [1.3 Mb]
	lynx-solo.Z		Lynx binary for sun4 (-lresolv) [0.5 Mb]
	test.html		Some examples
	README			This announce
	Mosaic-solo.tar.Z	Source+diffs for Mosaic & libwww/2.12 modified
	lynx-solo.tar.Z		Source+diffs for lynx & libwww/2.14

 WARNING:

	Binaries are just provided for testing purpose, and direct WAIS access
	is not included in them. The SOLO_TRACE flag is up in Mosaic-solo, so
	you'll get debugging info while testing the new module.

 Compiling with other browsers/servers:

	 It mainly depends on the version of libwww you're using. Basically,
	you'll have to modify library's Makefile to add HTSolo.c, and
	HTAccess.c to add new protocols. With lynx, I had also to modify
	LYUtils.c module to allow those URLs.
	 Some function calls have changed since libwww/2.12 (HTEscape and
	HTStreamStack), thus the OLD_LIBWWW compilation flag could be needed.
	 As a starting point, I recommend you extract
	lynx2-3/WWW/Library/Implementation from lynx-solo.tar, then look at
	CommonMakefile.diff, HTAccess.c.diff, and of course HTSolo.c.

 Any feedback will be welcome...

Dear fellow Web'ers,

I just finished a small patch to NCSAs httpd that enables NCSAs httpd to
do searches from inside a document, pretty much like the CERN httpd alread
does. From within any document, you can issue a search query, and a search
engine that is specified in the config file will be called up with the path
of the original file as an argument (so relative searches can be done).

But.. there is no clean way to automatically add the ISINDEX attribute
to a returned document in order to indicate that the server is searchable!
Since such a modified server supports searching, a document served to a
remote browser should indicate that searching is possible (which is the
only way to make the browser pop up a "enter search query" window).

<ISINDEX> is a header element, and thus is part of the document. Being
indexed (searchable) however is a property of the server, but NOT of the
document (cgi scripts are a special case here). So, IMVHO there ought to be
an HTTP header element which allows the _server_ to say "Hey, I support
queries, the document that follows is searchable". Yes, this seems to not
belong into HTTP, but it's simply is not a _document_ property. A file is a
file is a file, whether or not it is inside some index is nothing the author
should need to consider when writing the file - right? Should we have such
an element?

Waiting for the gurus to comment,
Yours, Chris

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

RSA AND EIT JOINT VENTURE
WILL MAKE INTERNET TRANSACTIONS SECURE

PALO ALTO, Calif., June 13, 1994 - RSA Data Security Inc. (RSA) and
Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp. (EIT) today announced the
formation of Terisa Systems, a joint venture that will market, license and
support technologies that make secure Internet transactions possible.  The
new company will provide toolkits and support to developers of Internet
applications for the World Wide Web (WWW) and NCSA Mosaic.

RSA is the world leader in commercial cryptography and principal source of
public key cryptosystems; EIT is a leading developer of software supporting
commercial use of the Internet.  Terisa Systems will combine the strengths
of both companies to provide developers of Internet applications with a
complete, consistent, and well-supported solution to their security needs.

Initial toolkits from Terisa Systems will support the development of secure
WWW clients and servers.  The World Wide Web is a popular Internet
application architecture that enables easy access to multimedia information
distributed across the thousands of computers that comprise the Internet.
However, use of the WWW in commerce requires features such as
authentication, authorization, encryption and payment that are currently
not well supported.

Terisa Systems will provide an integrated solution to all of these needs
based on RSA's public key cryptography and EIT's Secure-HTTP (HyperText
Transport Protocol), an enhanced version of the World Wide Web's internal
communications language.  Secure-HTTP ensures the authenticity of
transactions and the confidentiality of information exchanged via HTTP.
With a Secure-HTTP enabled application, a user can affix digital signatures
that cannot be repudiated, permitting digital contracts that are legally
binding and auditable.  In addition, sensitive information such as credit
card numbers and bid amounts can be encrypted and securely exchanged.

Secure-HTTP can incorporate a variety of cryptographic standards and
support interoperation between programs using diffeent cryptographic
algorithms.  This is particularly useful for interaction between domestic
and foreign users, where foreign users may not have access to the same
algorithms as domestic users.

Allan M. Schiffman, chief technical officer of EIT, said, "We've had
tremendous interest on the part of developers in Secure-HTTP, but haven't
been able to address their needs for a fully integrated package.  Terisa
Systems will provide 'one-stop shopping' for developers and give them the
technology and support they need to get their applications to the market
quickly."

According to John Young, chairman of Smart Valley Inc., "The Internet has
been evolving quickly as a medium where businesses can interact, but it is
weak in key areas, such as security, which is critically important to
business.  Terisa Systems is taking a significant step forward in enabling
electronic commerce by providing a standard security implementation for
software developers in this market."

RSA Technology

Terisa Systems' Secure-HTTP toolkits will use RSA public key cryptography
technology to permit spontaneous, secure communications between unfamiliar
correspondents over non-secure, open, public networks.  RSA's technology
provides privacy through encryption and authentication through digital
signatures.  Terisa Systems will be the one source from which WWW
application developers can obtain RSA security technology, complete with
Secure-HTTP integration and support.

Public key cryptography is a security technique that uses a matched pair of
encryption keys.  Data encrypted with an RSA public key can only be
decrypted with the corresponding RSA secret key, and vice-versa.  In
contrast, traditional shared-key cryptography requires correspondents to
agree on a secret encryption key before they can communicate.  Public key
cryptography avoids the need for prior agreement on keys, thus assuring
security between unfamiliar correspondents.

James Bidzos, president of RSA, said, "Rapidly growing interest in business
use of the Internet is producing a lot of interest in our security
technologies.  Developers, however, have been looking for a consistent,
interoperable, and quick way to incorporate these technologies.  Terisa
Systems will meet these needs by delivering RSA cryptography wrapped in a
high-value Web security system."

NCSA Mosaic

NCSA Mosaic, one of the most popular World Wide Web browsers, was developed
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the
University of Illinois.  Mosaic is a multi-platform program with a
point-and-click user interface for accessing the Internet and is primarily
known for its ability to view multimedia World Wide Web information.  NCSA
also distributes NCSA HTTPD, a WWW server software package that makes
information available to Mosaic and other WWW browsers.  The first toolkits
from Terisa Systems will include support for implementation of Secure-HTTP
in NCSA Mosaic and NCSA HTTPD.

In April, EIT, RSA, and NCSA announced an agreement to jointly develop and
distribute secure versions of NCSA Mosaic and NCSA HTTPD based on RSA's
public key cryptography and EIT's Secure-HTTP software. The enhancements
are to be made available to NCSA for widespread public distribution for
non-commercial use; Terisa Systems will now assume the responsibility of
providing these versions.  Terisa Systems' commercial line of toolkits and
support systems will further enhance the secure Mosaic and HTTPD
implementations with additional performance, functions and support options.

According to Joseph Hardin, director of the group that developed NCSA
Mosaic, "Mosaic's growth in the marketplace has been explosive, and has
positioned it as the application of choice for users of the World Wide Web.
With Secure-HTTP, Mosaic can become a framework for companies to engage
easily in routine commerce on the Internet.  By providing a standard source
for toolkits and support, Terisa Systems will address the need of
developers to implement Secure-HTTP applications quickly so they can
compete in the World Wide Web marketplace."

Products and Services

Terisa Systems will deliver a full line of toolkits and services.

SecureWeb Viewer Developer's Toolkit - Intended for developers of World
Wide Web clients, this toolkit is used to create viewers and other
applications that can communicate with Secure-HTTP enhanced WWW servers.
In addition, the toolkit will include a facility for managing multiple
certificates and keys, enabling, for example, the automatic selection of an
appropriate key through negotiation with the server.  User interface
components will provide easy-to-understand control over secure
communications, using icons to make clear the status of confidential or
digitally signed documents and other information.

SecureWeb Server Developer's Toolkit - Intended for developers of World
Wide Web servers, this toolkit facilitates the creation of WWW servers that
communicate with Secure-HTTP enhanced viewers.  The toolkit addresses the
more demanding server aspects of key and certificate administration.  It
includes tools for storing and managing multiple keys and certificates,
associating appropriate keys with requests for particular documents, and
managing the revocation of certificates and keys.  It also will provide a
stronger and more manageable document access control system.

Certificates are central to the use of public keys, for they guarantee
public key authenticity.  While Secure-HTTP works with hierarchical public
key certificates issued by major institutions, in the future, Terisa
Systems plans to provide toolkits that allow organizations to issue their
own certificates.  These certificates, called "lightweight" because they
may not be supported by rigorous user validation, enable businesses to
manage the certification process and issue their own certificates.

Initial implementations of Secure-HTTP and Secure-HTTPD will be provided to
NCSA in September, 1994 for subsequent non-commercial distribution.
Fully-supported Terisa Systems commercial security products will be
available in the fourth quarter of 1994.

In addition to toolkits, Terisa Systems will provide full support services,
including technical support, tutorials, training, an on-line information
service and custom consulting.

RSA Data Security Inc., Redwood City, Calif., invented the leading public
key cryptography system and performs basic research and development in
cryptography.  RSA markets software that facilitates the integration of
their technology into applications.

Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp. (EIT), of Palo Alto, Calif., is
an R&D and consulting organization, developing software and services that
help companies do business on the Internet.  EIT is also the project
manager for CommerceNet, the first large-scale market trial of electronic
commerce on the Internet.

You mean like
    Public: TEXTSEARCH

Yes, that's what it's for (just like ``Public: SPACEJUMP'' is to ISMAP).

And I'll again argue that this is the wrong header to put this information.
It should be a seperate header from Public.

Of course, no browsers currently accept this anyway (that I know of).

NNTP doesn't use those URLs partly since it dates back to "pre-URL"
days.  Still, we have an option to use the client-server protocol of
NNTP for remote access (nothing precludes it in the NNTP definition;
most clients support arbitrary configuration of the host address; and I
am not aware of inherent inefficiencies in remote NNTP access.)

I feel that the key question is whether we want to offer a smooth
migration path for newsgroups, which are very popular and widely used,
to the current architecture and capabilities of the Internet (recall
that NNTP was invented in the UUCP days), or whether we want to abandon
them in favour of our "brave new world".  I feel that if a migration
path can be offered, then it should be offered.  In this particular
case there are both architectural reasons and social reasons for that,
not the least of which is allowing people without full Internet access
participation in newsgroups, if needed, and allowing existing
newsgroups easy migration to remote access instead of "flooding".

The proposal I have put forward provides direct access to interactive
discussions for the "have's", and provides indirect, e-mail based
access for the "have not's".

I must admit I wasn't aware that URLs of the form "news://host/article"
were "forbidden"; to me they seem natural, self explanatory,
architecturally sound, and useful for newsgroups whose ownsers don't
wish to flood the entire Internet, yet wish to allow access to anyone
interested in participating.  So "forbidding" them in the name of some
higher principles ("though shall abandon NNTP in favour of HTTP?" :-)
seems to me to be a mistake.

-- Udi

p.s. On further enquiry Tim was not able to recall a source for
bidirectional newsgroup-mailing list reflector, so a pointer will be
appreciated.

ANNOUNCING THE PRE-RELEASE OF NCSA httpd FOR WINDOWS

NCSA httpd for Windows is done. I have just posted a complete new kit
containing everything that will be in the final release, now estimated
at mid-July. This is simply a "sanity check"  release.

This release documents an experimental Windows CGI interface. It has
actually been in a few of the previous releases, and some people have 
been quietly evaluating it. As a result of our work, it is also  ready
to go. It includes a reference implemetation in Visual Basic which has a
VB module that sets up the complete CGI environment within VB. One
notable feature of the Windows CGI interface is

    ** Built-in parsing and decoding of Mosaic form fields **

For more information (including a detailed description of the server and
its features), please see the project home page:

   ftp://netcom12.netcom.com/pub/rdenny/www/index.htm

Please be patient with this FTP based home page. It will change in a few
weeks.

Subject: HTTP problem or Mosaic problem?
content-length: 2365

I'm a graduate student at University of California at Berkeley in the
department of Computer Science working in the multimedia group.  As
many of you are aware, we have developed and released the CMPlayer
which plays MPEG movies (both audio and video) across a network.

We are interested in interfacing the CMPlayer with NCSA Mosaic.  In
some of the preliminary work, we've studied HTTP and, of course,
surveyed similar efforts across the Internet.  

We see a problem in either Mosaic or HTTP.  In Mosaic, an object that
is fetched by clicking on a hyperlink is done so synchronously, e.g.
control does not return to the client until the entire transaction is
completed.  A simple example is that you don't see your HTML page
displayed until the entire page has been received.  With an MPEG
movie, you cannot watch it until the entire movie is on your local
machine.  We feel that this is bad for a variety of reasons.  First,
useful work can be done with partial data.  Second, you run the risk
of not being able to fit a very large object in your storage
hierarchy.  Clearly this last point is somewhat forward looking;
however we already see several megabyte mpeg movies available.

My question: is the "synchronous" nature of Mosaic because HTTP is
meant to be implemented this way or just a consequence of the way this
web browser was implemented?  On page 2 of the draft HTTP
specification, you see the four steps of a transaction, e.g.
connection/request/response/close.  There appears to be no reason that
the browser cannot begin to do useful work during the response step.
Has an intent been clearly specified for what is supposed to happen or
is it open to interpretation?

Obviously, we advocate that work begin during the response step and a
pipelined method of using data be used.  

With respect to our work, we have two approaches that we will be
investigating:

1)As soon as data begins arriving, an external viewer can be spawned
to use the data.  This would require modifying Mosaic itself.
(essentially what is described above)

2)Have the web server spawn a process which deals with the
communication and sending of the information to a similar process on
the client machine.

We welcome all comments on this work and suggestions,

One way to get a web client to launch something that then deals
asynchronously with an information source is to do it with new MIME
types: 

* create a new mime type, e.g.,

	application/x-cmplayer-connection

  and define it as, for example, an ascii text file with, for example,
  a URL in it.

*  modify CMPlayer so that it takes a URL
  You might want to restrict this, to, say, gopher: URLs, just
  to keep the implementation simple.
* change your mailcap so that application/x-cmplayer-connection
  will launch CMPlayer
* Have the link to the MPEG movie return the URL of the movie as
  application/x-cmplayer-connection

That is, don't expect your web browser to be asynchronous, just have it
launch another application which is.

I think a similar setup is useful for allowing someone to open up a
VAT or NV multi-cast session via the web: have the definition for
	application/x-mcast-session
be `a text file with a list of address/port descriptions for multicast
audio and video'.

This adds a level of indirection, but allows you to use current
browsers without recompiling and fairly minimal reconfiguration.

I agree completely.

1. The NCSA's Mosaic product was based on CERN's libwww, but NCSA did not
   new versions of libwww after version 1.x.  Since then both NCSA's branch
   and CERN's have evolved. We have it high on our agenda to merge the
   two branches again.  Most of NCSA's enhancements and many others have
   already been folded into libwww.  So we'd like you to work with us
   to incorporate real-time abilities into libwww for use by all clients,
   not just NCSA's.

>  A simple example is that you don't see your HTML page
> displayed until the entire page has been received.

2. The libwww internal structure uses a "stream" concept.  A stream is
   a write-only thing.  Data arriving
   over the net (etc) is pushed into a stream which is typically a
   parser, reformatter, etc, which often pushes data into another
   stream, until it is eventually stored, presented, or passed across
   the net again.  There is therefore no buffering of the entire
   object between stages of the pipeline.  Each stage is a state machine
   which only carries the minimum state and look-ahead necessary for parsing.
   You notice this pipelining with the line mode broser
   that it will display the first characters on the screen the moment they
   arrive, which gives a faster response time than you see with Mosaic.
   It is only a feature of Mosaic that you don't see the document until it is
   finished.  (It's easier that way, and in probably faster to get to the
   end of the document if you don't have to keep the screen refreshed)
   The libwww pipeline architecure also makes it easy to hang for example
   a movie player on of course.
   

3. Henrik Nielsen is working here on libwww and making it multithreaded,
   so that clients can do other things with o ther windows, other
   requests, while a documentis being processed. This would obviously
   useful if one is to be able to work while watching the football.
   This is for the release after next of libwww, but much of the
   groundwork is already in.

	You bet.
  First,

	Sure.  Of course the counter reason is that you may not be
	able to get the MPEG fast enough to play on the fly
	-- often people can't even
	get sound fast enough, and have to wait a minute for a 10 sec
	sound byte.  So one needs a choice depending on the
	storage vs. bandwidth availability.

	Oh, there are plenty of movies.  It is the bamndwidth we lack.
	But in certain cases the bandwidth you can gurantee, so
	I'd like to see this option plugged in now.

	Open.  In fact, Phil Hallm-baker here has already made a IRC
	protocol module which gives you a text document which is 

	a continuously incrementing record of an IRC chat session.
	There are lot sof other cases in which you would want to
	fork of a stream, like a group edit sesssion on a document, etc.

	libwww is totally pipeline oriented.

	That is no problem at all.  We'll make it a configuration
	option so it can be programmed in or specified in a
	client config file.  It means putting a popen() into the
	code which is a security hole of course but that is inherent
	in the launching of an external viewer.

	You would maybe want to do this if you want to run a protocol
	other than TCP/IP (maybe RTP or something) for the connection,
	or if your operating sytem won't let the server or client
	hand over the existing TCP/IP connection to the new process.

I would go further -- that we want the brave new world to have NNTP.
(If all the new news were acecssed by HTTP the net would melt just as
it would if all the HTTP documents were served using NNTP!).  There is a need
in fact for a cache-cache protocol which migrates seamlessly betewen
the two extremes of HTTP and NNTP.  I just don't think that using NNTP
 as HTTP helps in that regard. For users, HTTP/NNTP/mail gateways already  
give migration paths
and ways to allow users at all levels to hook up with appropriate
levels of functionality.

(If you want to migrate from driving on the left to driving on the right,
driving in the middle is not a good strategy!)

They aren't in the spec.  They were proposed on the URI group and
were called "nntp:" not "news".

The higher principles are *not* that that one should migrate, but that
one should use NNTP for broadcast and HTTP for individual retrieval,
and that one should have a consistent model of reference before
defining new URIs.

Or use the MIME type application/x-csh along with vsafecsh to launch the
applications using a small script supplied by the server.  Check out
Anders Klemets Media on Demand Server to see how it works:

	http://www.it.kth.se/~klemets/vatplay.html

By using vsafecsh you limit the danger of naught people running dubious
scripts on your machine.

I suggested setting up:
	application/x-mcast-session
to be `a text file with a list of address/port descriptions for multicast
audio and video'.

but I like setting up a new MIME type for mcast-session because it is
nominally less operating-system dependent than a `x-csh' type.

Oh, I suppose one could do a 'vsafecsh' for Windows that actually only
special cases a couple of shell commands, but it seems wrong to load
it all into one media type.

Hi,

I enclose the 1st draft (complete with all errors) of a short paper that
I knocked up last night in/this morning, based upon the trials and
tribulations of creating a uniform web space in a multi-department
environment. It covers the possible areas of resistance that can be
encountered, and looks for a path through them.

Obviously it needs more work done on it, but at this point Im looking
for suggestions as to whether people think that the points that are made
are indeed valid. What solutions people can recommend etc. (Also typo
and gramatical corrections appreciated *sigh*)

The URL of the paper is:

	http://http2.brunel.ac.uk:8080/paul/papers/intro_html_3.html

But I have appeneded a text version. The HTML version has links to the
good and bad HTML examples.

Comments please :)

Paul

p.s. watch out for a paper coming soon commemorating the 1st aniversary
of HTTPD served web space at Brunel.

  ABSTRACT
   
   With the formalization of the HTML standards at the May 1994 WWW
   conference, a number of changes to the way that documents are marked
   up using HTML came into effect. Some of these are minor, some major
   and some just a reiteration of good practices that people are not
   using.
   
   This paper outlines what is wrong with the way HTML is being viewed at
   Brunel at the moment and what could be done to perhaps solve some of
   this, outlining some of the ongoing situations that need to be
   resolved, and possible suggestions for doing so.
   

  INTRODUCING HTML 2.0 AND HTML 3.0 COMPLIANT MARKUP INTO BRUNEL UNIVERSITY.
                                       
1 Introduction.
   
   The computer centre at Brunel University has recently undergone the
   HTML revolution and begun moving some of its user documentation on
   line. In addition to this a large number of users have created their
   own home pages. As a result there are a large number of HTML pages
   within the brunel.ac.uk domain.
   
   The Web structure at Brunel is probably fairly unique. We currently
   have 4 httpd servers all serving different tasks. The structure of
   these looks something like:

                              The User
                                  |
                                http3 <==> 150Mb Cache
                                  |
                     '-------+----+---+-------`
                     |       |        |       |
                   http1   http1    http2   world
   port:            8080    4040     8080

   
   Basically the local servers break down as follows: 
   
   http1.brunel.ac.uk:8080
          The main Brunel service. University home page. Guide to Brunel.
          
   http1.brunel.ac.uk:4040
          The StudentSoft service. Holds information on the Studentsoft
          project.
          
   http2.brunel.ac.uk:8080
          Solaris manual pages and user home pages. Also holds some
          newsgroup home pages.
          
   In addition to this (as the above textual representation indicates) we
   also have a cache service running on http3 with a small cache of
   approximately 150Mb. This is sufficient at the moment with most users
   currently being away on industrial placements or on holiday.
   
   Currently we recommend two Web browsers at Brunel, NCSA Mosaic for
   X/Openwindows, and Lynx for text based systems. Both are only
   available on SunOS 4.1.3, (Although a Solaris 2.3 version of Mosaic is
   under test) and only Mosiac is actively supported by the User Support
   team.
   
   From this then it can be seen that Brunel is probably of average size
   for a World Wide Web site, so many problems introducing new tools and
   requirements for HTML found at Brunel may apply elsewhere.
   
   So what are the problems associated with the introduction of the new
   standards?
   

2 But It Works!
   
   A common misconception among users writing HTML is the "But it works
   with the current version of Mosaic" attitude. This leads to some
   interesting bad practices, which, when combined with the new
   definition of items such as paragraphs and lists, may cause absolute
   chaos.
   
   For example, the following sort of markup is quite common:

   <HTML>
   <TITLE>A document</title>
   <H1>A test document</H1>
   <P>
   This is a paragraph with a list:
   <MENU>
   <IMG SRC="dot.gif" ALT="*">Item one<BR>
   <IMG SRC="dot.gif" ALT="*">Item two<BR>
   </MENU>
   </P>
   
   The basic structure of this document isn't two hard to derive.
   Basically, what it should read is:

   <HTML>
        <HEAD>
                <TITLE>A document</TITLE>
        </HEAD>
        <BODY>
                <H1>A test document</H1>
                <P>
                        This is a paragraph with a list
                </P>
                <DL>
                        <DT><IMG SRC="dot.gif" ALT="*">Item One</DT>
                        <DT><IMG SRC="dot.gif" ALT="*">Item two</DT>
                </DL>
        </BODY>
   </HTML>

   There is a big difference between the two. One is correct and one
   isn't (ignoring the fact that the <HEAD> and <BODY> tags can be
   implied in the first example). Both will render in Mosaic 2.4. But
   only one passes a DTD compliance test.
   
   With the moves to make documents compliant in the future this will
   cause great problems. So much so that I am starting to tell people
   that if they write their documents in the way of the first example
   then I can only see their documents working correctly after about the
   next 3 months.
   
   The problem is however that because of the fact that bad practices
   currently work with existing browsers, people are unwilling to make
   the change. But things get worse.
   

3 Using Editors - Correct vs. Easiest to use

   This can probably be described as the root of the problem. With the
   current HTML DTDs only just being laid down in stone, many HTML
   editors are still a step or two behind the time. This creates a
   situation whereby documents are being produced by editors that claim
   to be compliant with current standards (again this means Mosaic!) but
   which are not correct.
   
   For example these pages were produced using HoTMetaL from Soft Quad.
   As far as I can tell it uses a very rigid interpretation of the HTML
   3.0 DTD, in that it will not let certain tags be nested although
   looking at the DTD they can be. However looking at other editors, and
   taking the output they produce (supposedly compliant) it will not read
   into HoTMetaL. The problem with explaining this to users is that
   other editors are easier to use!
   
   So which is the right path to take? Obviously the compliant path since
   this guarantees that a document will display in the future. But if the
   user tools are not in place to help people do this, we are stuck at
   base one. And the problem gets worse when we consider that many people
   out there are editor illiterate and so need things as simple as they
   can get.
   
   (Aside: Today for the 1st time I am using HoTMetaL with "show tags"
   off. Its taken me a week to learn how to use it correctly, and
   understand its warnings. So what chance the normal user? On the other
   hand, there are editors out there which our User Support people tell
   me can be learnt in a few minutes but which produce dubious output.
   What would a typical user chose?)
   

4 House/Corporate Styles.
   
   Another situation we are currently trying to resolve at Brunel at the
   moment is that of the introduction of a default style for markup in
   departmental pages. That is, trying to define a common layout of
   information for entry pages for departmental information.
   
   This creates a situation whereby we need to be able to enforce both:
     * Layout and content.
     * HTML style (i.e. version 2.0 or 3.0 compliant)
       
   While this can be considered a side issue of the two previous cases it
   does draw the two together nicely. It is envisaged that templates will
   be provided for users to use to create their own pages. But the
   problem still exists as to ensuring that the document is still DTD
   compliant and what to do if it isn't!
   
   There is still a market out there for correction tools.
   
   (Another note: Again HoTMetaL will tell you what is wrong, but it wont
   correct it. I don't know about other editors since I never go that
   far!)
   
5 Conclusion
   
   In writing this paper I deliberately chose not to offer solutions to
   the problems being encountered, and not to discus options that are
   being considered until this point. However we do have some ideas under
   review and these are basically as follows:

    1. Decide upon your page style but remember what correct HTML can and
       can't do.

    2. Produce templates for your users to use if they want. These should
       include as many examples as you can provide. Describle them within
       the document if you can!

    3. Consider the imposition of a default HTML authoring tool. If
       people want to use such a tool ensure that everyone is using the
       same one. Remember that it should be possible to use this tool on
       more than one platform (e.g. MS Windows, UNIX, MAC). Remeber that
       not everyone can run eXceed for MS Windows.

    4. Enforce your decisions. If someone produces HTML that is broken,
       suggest that they should be using the default editor. If you have
       the default editor set up correctly, they wont be able to write
       bad HTML. However you will also need to include provision for
       converting bad HTML to good HTML. Always tell people to read HTML
       primers before starting.

    5. Where possible don't allow bad HTML to be served by your HTTP
       daemons. This of may not always be possible (as in the case of
       Brunel).

    6. Pray to your relevant diety.
       
   
6 Footnote
   
   Finally I would just like to add a small plea to the world in general.
   I feel that the following are really needed at this point in time:

    1. True HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.0 browsers. (I know these are in the
       pipeline) I would especially like to see a version of Mosaic that
       complains if the HTML is wrong since this will prevent the biggest
       resistance to the future of the Web.

    2. More HTML editors supporting WYSIWYG. I know these are starting to
       appear but they need to start producing better HTML from the DTD
       point of view. (Again, I know this is a new area, but it needs to
       stated.)

    3. HTML fixers. Tools to take bad HTML and make it good. After all if
       Mosaic can display it it should be able to write it back out as it
       should be.

Why can't we resolve news URLs where the host name is omitted to mean
"global" news articles, and look them up in the default NNTP server,
and resolve full news URLs to mean the article at the specified host?
This may require certain discipline in creating cross-references and
other URLs based on the type of newsgroup.

Subject: HTTP problem or Mosaic problem?
content-length: 1803

An alternative (and perhaps better) way to achieve the asynchrony that David
Berger needs for his MPEG layer would be to make HTTP a state-ful rather
than state-less protocol.

This would have a number of advantages:
	- server could send parts of docs as needed/requested and know that
	parts have been sent to what servers.  This could *vastly* minimize
	net traffic, as Mosaic could respond to a "back" request by asking
	for just the first page of a doc.  Since I often hit "back" several
	times in a row, this would save having to get the whole bloody doc
	when all I want to do is skip back a few steps.

	(I'm sure we can all think of our own examples where getting a whole
	document is really not what we want.)

	- info providers could put large documents into the Web without
	having to do a lot of work to break them up into tiny files.

	- clients could tell servers more about themselves.  For example, my
	client may take data in any of 100 formats.  It would be very nice
	if I didn't have to send that whole list to the server every time I
	retrieve a doc from it.

	- semantic navigation would be much easier.  If the server knows
	that I'm following a trail of, say, documents on biology, it can
	present me with a portion of the information it has, with that
	portion I see being tailored to my current needs.

What's the advantage of a state-less protocol?  It makes server writing
easier.  But that throws the burden off onto clients, onto the net, and onto
information providers.  You don't solve problems by shifting them around.

Hope you have your asbestos suit handy :)...  I am working on implementing a 
corporate repository of reference documents that will be accessed via WWW 
browsers, using both HTML hypertext links and WAIS document text searching 
to provide the maximum # of paths to internal technical information.  There 
are commercial packages for this out there, but they: a) are expensive for 
non-mission critical data ($200+/user); and b) appear not to scale as well 
as the Web technology seems to.  It may be that we are just part of a wave 
of sites that are now email-connected to the Internet, but will have IP 
connectivity in the near future, so the original point is moot.  I am not 
sure.

Web technology is useful inside a medium large company, even without IP 
connectivity to the Internet.

One problem there. Is vsafecsh available for mac, pc/windows, NeXT, OpenVMS, 
Amiga ... 

Larry's solution had the merit of platform independence which c shell, safe or 
otherwise, does not. I mention this in particular because Mac users seem to use 
applications like CUSeeMe (?sp) which is, I think, a VAT application.

Limiting to a single platform, in this case Unix, seems undesirable unless there 
is no other way. In this case the shell is only launching another application, 
so the original MIME type suggestion seems to be the bigger win.

This is a thread that I don't think get's enough discussion -- the 
viability of the Web for LAN-based informations systems that just happen 
to scale into global systems.  In this regard, the "competition" isn't 
something like gopher, NNTP, or SMTP, but something like Lotus Notes.

Here are some features of Notes that distinguish it as a LAN infosystem:
1) Replication (server-server and disconnected user-server)
WWW := this NNTP proposal for broadcast HTML
WWW := for disconnected (pop3-type) users, server-side smart agents in 
TCL, python, etc. ???
WWW := caches (future, hierarchical caches?)

2) Authentication and Encryption
WWW := Secure-HTTP, Shen, PEM, etc.

3) Versioning for revisions
WWW := URI's for multiple revisions of the same URL (no idea here)

4) Cross-platform
WWW := even better than Notes

5) Document-centric
WWW := currently as good as Notes.  Mailcap is not the same, but 
equivalent to, object embedding.  Accessories and safe-tcl will help.

6) Somewhat "open" (ouch, careful with the flames)
Notes fits enough of what a PC decision-maker would consider open.  For 
us, of course not.

We can name WWW technologies to address each of these.  However, each 
seems a bit disconnected from the other, and none of the server side 
stuff is administrator friendly, at least in the context of a PC user.

Can the WWW "sell" into spaces that would adopt Notes as their corporate 
infosystem?

I am not sure if i have followed the entire conversation thread here, so
apologize in advance if this doesn't make sense. 

I get the sense that you want todo a point-to-point or multicast session 
instantiated via Mosaic. Well, i did something a while ago that supports 
point-to-point audio/video sessions using some of the Mbone tools instantiated 
via application/x-mmphone.

You may take a peek at Mmphone at 
	http://www.eit.com/software/mmphone/phoneform.html

To use it, you will need to ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/share/wwwphone.pl
and add an entry to your .mailcap that looks like
	application/x-mmphone; wwwphone.pl %s

And this could easily be upgraded to support multicast sessions as well, just
haven't had the time.

I just joined this mailing list so I hope that this post is appropriate here.
I'm also assuming that everyone on the other www-* lists reads this list.  If
this is not generally the case, could somebody tell me?

</pre>

<p> After reading Dave Raggett's brief paper on HTML+ (which triggered a
brief phone conversation with him) and some of the procedings from the WWW
conference, I've become concerned about the future of HTML.  Definitely not
its popularity, but its complexity.  This article is a brief summary of my
concerns.  I would really like to know how many people share my concerns ---
please, send me mail or post a reply.  I'll post a summary if necessary.

<h1>Concerns with HTML+</h1>

<p> These are just some of my thoughts that I feel I need to discuss with
the Web community before the current HTML+/2/3/etc. proposals become so
popular that they can't be changed.  My goal here is just to stimulate
discussion and ideas for different ways of pursuing multi-media world-wide
hypertext.

<p> Some of my concerns are technically HTML+ independent, but I'm going to
pick on HTML+ anyway.  I think HTML+ will influence the architecture of the
next generation Web browsers, and therefore control what becomes popular in
documents.

<p> One last comment before I get into my concerns:  I don't mean to start a
holy war.  Hopefully, we will pick the best solution; maybe that's HTML+ as
it stands today, I don't know.  Whatever it is, it's vital that we *not*
fragment the Web community so that some people publish for browser A which
uses HTML 2 and and others for browser B which uses HTML 4 --- each of which
are only marginally compatible with each other.

<h2>HTML+ is too large and complex</h2>

<p> One of the great things about HTML is its small size.  This means that
browsers can be created easily (well, almost :-) and that new users have
virtually no trouble learning how to create documents.  I guess we really
can't add functionality to HTML without sacrificing some of the ease-of-use
in creating HTML documents.  That's not true of browser creation though!  I
really think we should keep the ability to easily build new browsers.  The
area is just too interesting and immature to raise the entry stakes just yet.
It will be a sad day when it takes several people working several months
just to get a basic browser --- how can we expect to see radical new
browsing and navigation aids?

<p> We really need to think about who in the industry is in the best
position to implement/control monolithic standards and monolithic browsers.
It isn't CERN, NCSA or the community of Web hackers, that's for sure!  The
only people in a position to implement a monolithic browser are those with
dedicated (and large) programming staffs --- such as Framemaker or Microsoft.

<h2>HTML+ can never do it all</h2>

<p> I can understand where the current philosophy of "put it all in HTML"
comes from.  NCSA has followed this policy and it's worked out well for
Mosaic's popularity.  I think it's vital that capabilities such as inline
images, sounds, and fill-in forms be available in Web browsers.  But who
actually thinks that a Web browser should be expected to do it all?  Wasn't
the purpose of HTML to add hypertext *markup* to information?  Why then is
HTML+ completely dominated with content representation and presentation
concerns?

<h2>HTML+ is hard to experiment with</h2>

<p> When a browser creator wants to experiment with new rendering features,
tables for instance, it's going to be difficult to isolate the table code so
that it can be easily changed and tested.  If a user wants to experiment
with different table rendering it's almost impossible.  She has to get the
source code for the browser, figure out the layout algorithms, find where
the table code is, extract it, and then start modifying it.  I think this is
unreasonable.  Of course this is not HTML's fault directly --- it's one of
the implementation side effects from HTML+.

<h1>Suggestions for improving HTML+</h1>

<p> These are just thought starters.  I like them, but they need a lot more
detail.  Both technical (which I'm working on) and political (which is why
I'm writing this article.)

<h2>Separate navigation and structure from content and presentation</h2>

<p> I think that HTML should be radically simplified.  It should concentrate
on navigation (i.e. hypertext references) and structure (e.g. this table
appears next to this paragraph.)  The content (e.g. the text of the
paragraph and the data in the table) and the presentation (e.g. the font of
the paragraph and the column widths in the table) should be called out
either as separate standards or clearly marked sections of HTML+.

<p> I favor separate standards.  We could then debate and approve each
standard separately.  This way we don't have bits and pieces of HTML+ being
implemented or not implemented as people argue about bits and pieces of
HTML+.  The different level of implementation table I've seen (from the WWW
conference procedings) looks like a nightmare.  Anybody with any experience
in IGES (a U.S. graphics exchange standard used primarily in the CAD
industry) can attest to the problems of "level of implementation,"
affectionately known as flavorizing &lt;gag&gt;.

<h2>Encourage modular browsers with external rendering</h2>

<p> I want to see plug-in rendering agents that work with a variety of
browsers.  This would allow me, the user, to pick my favorite browser and my
favorite rendering style.  This would allow me, the programmer, to
experiment with different navigation aids without re-inventing the rendering
algorithms.

<p> A rendering agent control protocol (RACP :-) should be designed to allow
browsers to control external rendering agents.  The browser would be
responsible for doing layout and management tasks, the rendering agent would
be responsible for manipulating the display of the information.  The
rendering agent would understand operations such as "use this data", "render
to this window", "format for printing", "search for key", "check for anchor",
"refresh", "handle event", etc.  Obviously this would have to be a
bi-directional protocol with state.  We might consider several types of
RACP:  one for TCP, one for OLE, one for shared memory, one for an API, one
for X property events, etc.

<p> The way I see things working is to have a public sample browser which is
capable of coordinating several sample rendering agents.  People who are
interested in writing new browsers could take this sample browser and add
the navigation features they want without disrupting any rendering.  Others
would take the sample browser and create new rendering agents.  Rendering
images, figures, structured graphics, tables, forms, equations and scripts
could all be done with external rendering agents.  I expect most text
rendering to be provided internally by most browsers, but even that should
be replaceable.  Of course, someone could also decide to build any portion of
the system from scratch --- even a monolithic browser that does all rendering
internally.

<h2>Add an attribute database to documents</h2>

<p> Style sheets are a great idea.  (Although I've haven't seen a detailed
proposal yet.)  Let's generalize them to an attribute database (similar to
the X resource database) used to specify attributes for any rendering
agent.  Attribute databases could be organized according to document type,
customizable by the user, etc.  A particular document could call out a
particular database "query" or simply in-line the required attributes.  Let
rendering agent authors decide what attributes are important, what their
syntax and semantics are.  Users could still configure the way documents are
presented by modifying their attribute database.

<h2>Multi-part documents, Security, etc.</h2>

<p> These are all of great concern to me, but they are unrelated to this
article.  In fact, I don't even know if they are part of HTML+, or simply
part of HTTP or some other Web infrastructure.

No, but neither are alot of the tools I use it to launch.

Well, Maven on the Mac will interoperate with VAT (CUSeeMe is the video;
nv can supposedly read its output but its a bit clunky to use the two
together).  The problem with the Mac is that its difficult to pass
arguments to the application (things like which IP
address/port/ttl/conference ID/window title/etc to use).  I'd guess that
the PC is similar, though I steer clear of Windoze so I'm not so sure
there.

Ah, but (in my case at least) vsafecsh is launching more than one
application simulatenously with different command line arguments.  Its
these arguments that are in the script passed out from the server as the
document.  Can you get MIME to launch multiple applications each with its
own arguments?  If so, I'd agree with you that a MIME type would be nicer.

This is how vsafecsh works:

1. It maintains a table of trusted and un-trusted binaries.

2. Whenever a set of programs come from a server, Mosaic looks
   up the mime-type application/x-csh and fires up vsafecsh.

3. vsafecsh then parses each command-set to see if the command-set
   is trusted. If yes, then it parses the components of the command-set
   to look for un-trusted commands.

e.g. if "xterm" is trusted, and "rm" if untrusted, then a command-set like
     "xterm -e rm" will not be executed. Fair enough ?

4. If step 3 goes failsafe, then it does a fork and exec.

5. If step 3 fails, then NOOP.

Now it should be easy to replace the mime-type application/x-csh with
application/x-mumbo, and ask the server to spit the same, and use the same
vsafecsh to do the fork and exec of multiple scripts. [or maybe i should
change the name to vsafemumbo....]

vsafecsh is still being tested, so if something doesn't work, or some features 
you don't like, please feel free to report it to me directly.

Well, Maven on the Mac will interoperate with VAT (CUSeeMe is the video;
nv can supposedly read its output but its a bit clunky to use the two
together).  The problem with the Mac is that its difficult to pass
arguments to the application (things like which IP
address/port/ttl/conference ID/window title/etc to use).  I'd guess that
the PC is similar, though I steer clear of Windoze so I'm not so sure
there.

Ah, but (in my case at least) vsafecsh is launching more than one
application simulatenously with different command line arguments.  Its
these arguments that are in the script passed out from the server as the
document.  Can you get MIME to launch multiple applications each with its
own arguments?  If so, I'd agree with you that a MIME type would be nicer.

vsafecsh has little if anything to do with the C shell.  (Why, then, is it 
named
after it?  I dunno.)  As far as existing shells go, it's probably closer to rc
than the Bourne shell or C shell.  But yes, clearly vsafecsh wasn't intended
to provide portability.

Er, I don't exactly know what you're driving at, but if you mean what I think
you mean the content-type "multipart/parallel" should do what you want.
Whether most existing browsers will actually do this today is a different
matter, given the incredibly poor MIME handling that some (most?) have.

This is how vsafecsh works:

1. It maintains a table of trusted and un-trusted binaries.

2. Whenever a set of programs come from a server, Mosaic looks
   up the mime-type application/x-csh and fires up vsafecsh.

3. vsafecsh then parses each command-set to see if the command-set
   is trusted. If yes, then it parses the components of the command-set
   to look for un-trusted commands.

e.g. if "xterm" is trusted, and "rm" if untrusted, then a command-set like
     "xterm -e rm" will not be executed. Fair enough ?

4. If step 3 goes failsafe, then it does a fork and exec.

5. If step 3 fails, then NOOP.

Now it should be easy to replace the mime-type application/x-csh with
application/x-mumbo, and ask the server to spit the same, and use the same
vsafecsh to do the fork and exec of multiple scripts. [or maybe i should
change the name to vsafemumbo....]

vsafecsh is still being tested, so if something doesn't work, or some 
features 
you don't like, please feel free to report it to me directly.

It's surprising that this is the first comment about my article.  I was
going to put in more argument on this point but others here thought that it
actually detracted from the other points that I was making.  Live and learn
I suppose.

The point I was trying to make is that as software gets more and more
difficult to build (i.e. it's complexity increases) fewer and fewer people
are willing to expend the effort required to build it.  There are a number of
examples of really, really good freely available software.  Some examples of
these systems are the X Window System, Linux, Net/Free/386-BSD, GNU emacs,
the Andrew User Interface System, Tcl/Tk and TeX/LaTeX.  However, these
systems are still the exception --- I think that it's safe to say that it
would be extremely difficult to initiate a project of similar scale.

The situation changes radically as software becomes simpler.  If you look at
text editors or small languages the number and variety of free applications
is enormous.  Not only are there many implementations of similar ideas,
there are many different ideas.  Some of these implementations become
popular and embellished with features --- GNU emacs and Tcl/Tk from the
previous list.  Others don't survive but inspire other implementations.
Lot's of "one semester projects" contribute much creativity and fresh
insight.

If I apply this reasoning to HTML+, then there must be some point at which a
browser becomes so complex that very few people are willing (or able?) to
implement one.  Obviously we are not yet at that point with HTML.  (Looking
at the popularity of Mosaic vs. other browsers though, it seems that HTML is
already hard enough to implement that browsers are not casual undertakings.)

We could probably say that the goal of the current HTML+ specification is to
provide desktop-publishing-like content and presentation to HTML.  Certainly
there is very little new hypertext navigation functionality.  Web browsers
will start to look an awful lot like desktop-publishing applications.  How
many freely available desktop publishing tools do you know?  Who dominates
the desktop-publishing market?  How easy is it to make a desktop-publishing
application?  Who controls the desktop-publishing document format standard?

I hope this adds a little bit of meat to my admittedly airy dismissal.

The point is - the reason there are college students and professional people
writing web browsers and servers in their spare time (not discounting the
real, paid-for work being done as well), and the reason that web publication
took of in spite of there being absolutely no high-level authoring tools
available, is precisely because it was easy to write and engineer.  I'm
finding more and more non-technical people putting stuff up, in most cases
with wonderful results. 

Right now I tell people who want to publish something on the web that they
should learn HTML, and they usually wince and cower, out of fear that HTML is
as difficult for the average user as C, or even Unix.  I come back with a
"don't worry, there's really only a dozen tags to learn, and about 2 dozen
others you use every now and then", and usually within hours of reading the
"Beginners' Guide to HTML" they are making fairly high quality HTML 
documents.  

Because HTML is relatively simple, writing a browser is also simple (compared
to writing a compiler, say).  The existance of libwww made it even simpler to
do. 

What it feared is that HTML will get more complex - and some of the
suggestions posted here recently (arbitrary SGML code, etc) threaten to make
it an order of magnitude more complex.  Yes, there is going to be a tradeoff
between adding features and keeping it simple - the tables, in my mind, are a
good example of a complexity that adds significant ability. 

It's moderately easy to have the core language remain simple for the authorer
- simply make all the extra complexity optional, and its exclusion still
totally valid HTML X.X.  However, programmers writing browsing, authoring,
and server tools will be expected to incorporate these features into their
system, or they don't meet HTML <most-recent>.0 compliancy.  If reaching that
level means incorporating SGML interpreters, etc., it may be that only
companies which can afford to pay proficient programmers a real salary for a
period of months can afford to put out a quality product.  And thus, you get
the dichotomy the original poster feared, where the free stuff was, say, HTML
3.0 compliant and the for-pay stuff HTML 4.0 or 5.0 compliant. 

Hopefully there's a solution to this worry - enhancing and maintaining libwww
might be the best way, as it would hopefully take care of common complex
lower-level functions, and putting as much effort into high-level tools as
possible (a product integrating a browser, editor, *and* server would be 
nice) would help too.

Here's to the future.

I had several volunteers. Thanks. Each one wrote something like:

>
>Please let me know what you require, and I will do so.

Here's the deal: Each time I update the spec, I'll send mail to
www-html@info.cerh.ch.

At that point, you grab:

http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/HTML.txt
http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/HTML.ps.Z
http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/html-spec/html-spec.tar.gz

and put them on your server. I'd prefer that folks be able to
distinguish the release date from the name, for example:

	HTML-19940613.txt

but whatever keeps the customers happy is fine by me.

Then you send a message to www-html, comp.infosystems.www.misc, etc.
announcing the availability of copies of the spec. (PLEASE INCLUDE THE
RELEASE DATE ALL OVER THE PLACE, as this thing is still changing
somewhat rapidly.)

The more copies the merrier, as far as I'm concerned, as long as each
is clearly labelled with the release date.

I think that this will take significantly more effort than hoping.  :-)  The
approach you outline is similar to my "sample" implementation proposal.  I
agree that this is extremely useful --- it's worked out *extremely* well for X.

I believe the real solution is to segment HTML into separately implementable
pieces and then provide the glue to hold those pieces together.  My first
article touches on this.  If there's continued interest, I'll post a more
technical article detailing my approach to the problem.  Who else is working

No desire here to proliferate new URI's.  However there is the concept
of multicast (aka private newsgroups or mail lists).  It is not individual,
but not broadcast either.  The above URI, along with a nice viewer/poster
would address this.  The purpose of the URI is to be able to reference
(within some context, such as a common mail list or local news group)
articles that are posted.

The "news" method (sans hostname) would then still be the right choice
for global, broadcast articles, where the author that used the URI
not be concerned with how the viewer obtains his local view of the article.

Well, Maven on the Mac will interoperate with VAT (CUSeeMe is the video;
nv can supposedly read its output but its a bit clunky to use the two
together).  The problem with the Mac is that its difficult to pass
arguments to the application (things like which IP
address/port/ttl/conference ID/window title/etc to use).  I'd guess that
the PC is similar, though I steer clear of Windoze so I'm not so sure
there.

Ah, but (in my case at least) vsafecsh is launching more than one
application simulatenously with different command line arguments.  Its
these arguments that are in the script passed out from the server as the
document.  Can you get MIME to launch multiple applications each with its
own arguments?  If so, I'd agree with you that a MIME type would be nicer.

Well, Maven on the Mac will interoperate with VAT (CUSeeMe is the video;
nv can supposedly read its output but its a bit clunky to use the two
together).  The problem with the Mac is that its difficult to pass
arguments to the application (things like which IP
address/port/ttl/conference ID/window title/etc to use).  I'd guess that
the PC is similar, though I steer clear of Windoze so I'm not so sure
there.

Ah, but (in my case at least) vsafecsh is launching more than one
application simulatenously with different command line arguments.  Its
these arguments that are in the script passed out from the server as the
document.  Can you get MIME to launch multiple applications each with its
own arguments?  If so, I'd agree with you that a MIME type would be nicer.

But you do stop the servers from tying up resources waiting for clients to
make the next move in a stateful protocol.  On a heavily used server,
having the connections die between client requests can be a big win.  IMHO
HTTP has been successful partly because it is easy to implement a basic
server and it doesn't rapidly overload the machine.  If people feel they
need a stateful protocol, I think they should come up with something new
rather than subvert the statelessness of HTTP.

All IMHO of course.

Exactly our experience.  For Lotus Notes to be useful to us in widespread 
dissemination of technical ideas/hints/etc., we would have to install around 
500 copies at a cost of $150,000 (US) -- definitely not cheap.  If 
implementing the system I've described using Lotus Notes would only then 
save us $80,000, I have just wasted $40,000!  Unfortunately, my experience 
is that other document-sharing platforms are not significantly less 
expensive.  Whether I use the Web or Lotus Notes (or something else), my 
time will still have to be spent on educating myself, building the 
application(s), and educating the user community.  So why not choose at the 
start a very open, flexible, and scalable technologies like WWW and WAIS?

Pardon my ignorance but isn't one enormous advantage of stateless protocols
a handshake free internet?  Other comms systems are burdened by the
requirement on the client and the server to constantly verify each other's
continuing connection.  If stateful protocols (ftp aside) start to
proliferate on the internet, along with the explosion BLOB transfers from
Mosaic clients, then isn't there a danger of a massive and permanent traffic
jam?

I watched the start of this discussion with the CMPlayer request and I
agree with whoever said that it is the client's responsibility to ensure
sufficient local storage space to process whatever is requested.

Ok... but I don't see what the difference is between a binary that is
"untrusted" and one that isn't in the table at all.

If "echo" is trusted, would "echo -n rm" be executed?

It seems to then immediately go on to the next command rather than
wait()ing on the process; i.e. all commands are implicitly suffixed
with "&"; yes?  Is this changable?

     I am a relatively new participant in these discussions, but I believe 
     Ken's point may be somewhat validated by reviewing the history of 
     Unix.
     
     Unfortunately, without a major player providing a 'standard' 
     implementation for commercial use, it may not be possible to achieve a 
     stable HTML environment. My experience with various commercial 
     enterprises suggests that each one will implement its own 'flavor' 
     which may or may not be compatible with the rest of the known 
     universe.
     
     As to the statement that someone with a large dedicated programming 
     staff will be able to successfully implement a monolithic browser, I 
     again refer to the Unix history. There seem to be as many flavors of 
     Unix as there are major university computing centers. Again, my own 
     experience indicates that with this type of proliferation in the 
     environment, development of a singular commercial 'standard' will 
     probably not occur in the academic environment, nor in a dispersed 
     commercial one, but rather because a major corporation implements its 
     own flavor and aggressively markets it. And as is generally known, 
     such a product will usually not be a fully implemented variety of 
     HTML, but a standard subset from which extensions will be developed.
     
     While Ken's statements are unsupported in his original text, there may 
     indeed be some merit in what he is saying. I don't think his comments 
     should be dismissed lightly.

In response to my arguments for a state-ful HTTP protocol, Jon Knight says:

This is preciesly the sort of thing I was ranting about.  *Obviously* a
server which ties up resources in this way is badly written.  To make life
easier for bad server-writers, HTTP throws the whole burden off onto the
clients and the info providers.

I don't think we need to throw away ("subvert") HTTP -- there are provisions
in the protocol for sneaking state in already, but they're so clunky no one
ever uses them.  BUt I do think we need to look at the patterns of use that
we are seeing in the real world today and try to figure how to minimize the
burden.  It seems to me that today we have a lot of cases where downloading
whole documents is both painful and unnecessary (and goodness knows we don't
need to create more unnecessary bandwidth!).

Actually I would say that the various web servers - CERN, NCSA, Plexus, gn, Mac 
HTTP - and the browsers - NeXT, the three Mosaics, Chimera, Cello, W3emacs, plus 
Dave Raggetts and Phil Hallam Bakers testbed ones - plus the assorted CGI 
scripts and other nifty gateways and stuff - plus the various editors either 
available now or in progress - plus maintenence tools like MOMspider - plus the 
other robots and other indexing tools - collectively correspond to a "project of 
similar scale" already.

The trick is to have an interface specification so that people can implement 
small bits without having to wory about all the other bits. 

If I want to link to a new-and-wizzy format that holds, say, five channels of 
floating point colour data from a satellite I just need to implement a viewer 
for that type and declare a MIME type. Everything else works fine with it.

If I want to make my server use an automated English-to-French translator on all 
files before sending them to clients in .fr domain, again there are selected 
bits of the server to alter, I don't need to re implement the whole thing from 
scratch.

Chimera extends this idea by devolving _all_graphics rendering onto external 
apps. So to do an inline GIF, have the GIF viewer render into a pixmap or an 
area of the main window that you give it. Suddenly, having any type of graphics 
inline becomes possible without additional effort.

So the ideal is to have a flock of communicating applets, all providing some 
service or other, and the browser as such is just the glue that synchronises and 
coordinates this flock. Any applet can be enhanced without impacting the others.

I believe Dave Raggetts browser is designed this way.

OK then, I will agree with you. But the last thing we want is a monolithic 
browser, so that ceases to be a problem.

It also removes the problem that once some large monolithic company got hold of 
the Web the first thing they would do would be to introduce subtle 
incompatibilities so that their payware version gave you an advantage, and so 
you were locked into their 6 monthly upgrade payment cycle. This is just based 
on past experience of companies like these. Ask anyone how well the RTF standard 
fares each time Microsoft upgrade their products. Its just easier, all round, to 
only use Microsoft products - use Word to generate it, use their help compiler 
to process it. So simple, all you have to do is pay them and trust them. No 
thanks.

One of the stongest consensuses (consensi??) to come out of WWW94 was the 
universal dread of what would happen when Microsoft noticed the Web. To be fair, 
I think that particular company was being used as an archetype of the general 
class of commercial companies.

I agree completely, which is why the current situation of Web design by 
consensus among people interested in the Web is the best bet. Hardly a week goes 
by without some new, small improvement in one area or another. As the interfaces 
become better defined, this process will accelerate. Hey folks, I knocked up an 
improved HTML 3.0 table renderer, works with all compliant browsers. Do you see 
some huge corporation coming out with statements like that? No. 

<aside>
For a laugh, try telling Frame (just to show I am not singling out Microsoft 
unduly) that you really need multi page footnote handling and could they 
implement it soon please. If you need to understand this joke, try scanning the 
framers list and see how far back those requests have been coming.)

Implement one, no. Implement bits, yes.

Yup.

None worth a damn. Yet.

>Who dominates the desktop-publishing market?  How easy is it to make a 
>desktop-publishing application?  

How easy is it to get them to respond to user demands? How many users are locked 
into proprietary solutions and forced to pay top whack because the cost of 
moving to another proprietary solution is too great?

>Who controls the desktop-publishing document format standard?

Which standard was that, again?

The point about the increasing complexity of the raft of software collectively 
implementing the Web is well taken. But the solutions are already in hand, using 
the long established software engineering practice of modularity.

My comment is to Chris Lilley ...

<flame>

As a long suffering Windows 3.1 user I would not be very happy delegating
the task of developing a character set for my pocket calculator to
Microsoft.  Cobol, love it or hate it, is a far better paradigm.  The
COmmon Business Oriented Language was a 1950's US Government inspired
software standard for a specific purpose, you might not like cobol but it
is still used today in almost exactly the same form as it first appeared. 
I would favour a (preferably inter-) governmental standard for a
distributed information system (www, gopher - call it what you will).

If this is not possible then why not CERN or NCSA, after all the folks at
these sites have already achieved a great deal in terms of information
architecture (HTML) and distribution (httpd).

Don't forget - Windows 3.1 was shipped as marketable with some thousands of
known bugs - do we want this to happen to cyberplace ???

I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE!! I have quietly observed the chatter about navigability, 
etc. and it is clear that there is a need for something that can provide more 
structure. If you  want to learn about the impact of keeping state at the 
connection level, look at any busy FTP installation. Now imagine the client 
reading and maybe printing documents while staying connected to the server all 
the while. All those forked subprocesses laying idle a large fraction of the 
time. And the what happens if the link is broken?

On the other hand, it is possible TODAY to implement a "stateful" application, 
using CGI. It would be up to the back-end and the client to work together to 
identify the "session", perhaps with URL-encoded "handles". This seems FAR 
better to me than trying to keep state at the HTTP level or the connection 
level. You could start a session, go to bed, and pick it back up the next 
morning.

Several developments will help to manage the increasing complexity for 
Web browser and even viewer developers, including definition of a Common 
Client Interface and ways of "modularizing" the HTML spec.  There will 
certainly always be a place for powerful, commercially-developed browsers 
& viewers, but the situation seems comparable to that for X Window 
Managers, of which there are several very good free ones.  The WWW 
technologies are, after all, _OPEN_ (as opposed to most commercial desktop 
publishing and/or hypermedia environments).

I perceive it as more like "to provide a baseline of content and 
presentation capability to HTML and the capability for browsers to 
interact with sophisticated accessories for more powerful presentation 
modes."

That last question is pretty interesting ... I would say the answer is 
changing!  The applications you are talking about here are analogous to HTML 
_editors_, not _browsers_.  I agree that the realm of HTML _editors_ 
will be dominated by commercial products.  Let's be real:  HoTMetaL is 
really a "loss-leader" for its commercial version -- and I for one 
think that's just dandy, thanks!  Even so, I am sure there will 
always be the emacs extensions, etc. ....

But this is not really the same thing.  These projects are (for the most
part) sponsored and controlled by individual groups --- not some coordinated
large effort.  It's like saying the contributed software in X is more complex
than the X server or the Linux kernel.  This is not true.  Indeed, the
aggregate of all of the contributed X packages is *a lot* of code.  But
because they are all independent projects with little interaction, the
complexity is containable.

I want to preserve the current Web model of lot's of people developing tools
in all sorts of places with loose coupling between them.

Now what if I want to embed that new-and-wizzy format into my document so
that I can flow text around it, or make it a hyper-reference, or simply make
it go away when I switch pages?  The current external viewer approach breaks
down!  We need better integration.

Servers are in a better position than browsers right now.  The transparent
invocation of server scripts enables this.  Browsers are *much* more
monolithic than servers.  (An aside to tkWWW users:  have you experimented
with a Tk document (register a new MIME type) that you read in an IMG tag
and dynamically load and run?)

Chimera is ahead of the game then --- I believe that the emacs browser does
something similar.  But this is still browser dependent (I can't write one
external rendering agent and expect it to work against a whole class of
browsers) and it still only works for *some* things.  What happens in
equation, table and form rendering for example?  How about embedding
*dynamic* objects --- like an interactive game?

This is exactly my point.  Let's simplify HTML+ by standardizing the "flock

I hate this possible future as much as you do.  Why do you think that this is
such an unlikely future?  Let's create an interesting browser/rendering
market where "best of class" tool integration is designed into the
architecture.

It's not going to be possible to prevent the commercialization of Web tools.
I *want* a large variety of Web tools --- both free and commercial --- to be
available.  The only way I know to prevent monolithic tools and big vendors
from dominating the market is to design in, at the most basic level, a
modular architecture.

No, but I do see some corporation modifying their desktop-publishing tools so
that they "do" HTML+.  Then those become popular, the applet market goes away
and the Web becomes a boring place to live (for a programmer... :-)

What a lead-in!  This is exactly one of the things I want to see allowed ---
you just defined a new tag (on the fly I suppose.)  Why not allow the tag to
be formally defined in the document header and associated with some external
rendering tool --- maybe even where to get a copy of it if the user doesn't
already have it?  Then a browser can just save up all the data and pass it
off to the renderer.  HTML could be trivially extended in this manner to
experiment with different ideas.  There's a lot more to this than what I just
said --- but we first need to see that a monolithic HTML+ is not going to
help us.

How do I know that my bit works with someone else's bit?  Interoperability
is key.  Otherwise all we have is a giant bucket of bits.  :-)

You know someone working on one?  If that's the case then how much
competition is it going to get after it's released?  Probably none!  That's
because of the enormous investment in creating one.  It will essentially
become the de facto "free" desktop publishing standard --- and if someone
wants to experiment with different interfaces and ideas, they may have to
start from scratch --- or just forget about trying them out.

And why do users live with this situation?  Because they can't negotiate
from a position of strength!  Vendors know that users have an investment in
documents, training, software, etc.  If vendors knew that a user could rip
out the table formatting code and put in something they like more, vendors
would radically change their ways.

> >Who controls the desktop-publishing document format standard?
> 
> Which standard was that, again?

My point exactly... :-)  When the market is dominated by a few key players
then standards get trampled on.  Isn't MS-DOS a great standard?  Isn't
MS-Windows a great standard?  Isn't Rich Text Format a great standard?  No,
of course not, these are all lousy standards.  We never know what part of
the standard is going to change.  We are *barely* able to influence it.  We
*know* that if a different vendor is somehow able to make something
compatible there will be gratuitous changes to prevent competition.  People
are dreaming if they think just because some big vendor starts with an HTML
compliant browser that they are going to stay that way!  Look how much Mosaic
has changed HTML.  We're just *damn lucky* that it was the NCSA that invented
Mosaic and not Microsoft.

Wow.  That's a twist I never thought of before.

If someone can demonstrate this to me I'd feel a whole lot more comfortable
about the future.

Project DA-CLOD is a distributedly administered centrally stored database of

This categorized database of hyperlinks currently contains over 500 document
links organized into more than 200 subject categories in a hierarchic tree

http://schiller.wustl.edu/DACLOD/daclod

You are invited to come and add your links to the database in the appropriate
categories, create new categories if necessary.  When modifying the database
please try to follow the guidelines in the instruction page.  Currently the
database is a bit cluttered and one of these days I plan to clean it up a bit.

In response to the many requests for the source of the project, I have
placed the C source code at our anonymous ftp site at:

Please remember that I haven't had a chance to clean up the code, so
it is provided as is, and with no guarantees whatsoever.  Feel free to do
what you wish with it -- you'll probably have to do a bit to get it to
work for you.

What's a Common Client Interface?  and how does it interact with the HTML
spec?  and who is modularizing HTML?  The only thing I've seen was some sort
of interoperability or feature matrix.  I hope that's not what you mean.

Hypothetical conversation between X guru and user:

USER: Gee can you combine the window border rendering code used in Motif
      with the icon rendering of ctwm and then add the workspace
      functionality of HP-vue?

GURU: No.  Go away.

USER: Why not?

GURU: Because they are different window managers.  You have to choose one.

USER: But I don't like any of them really.  Why can't I just take what I
      want from each?

GURU: Because that's not the way they work.

USER: That's dumb.  Why didn't somebody think about this.

GURU: You can't imagine how much thinking people did about this.  They thought
      it was enough just to be able to change *window managers*.  Go away.

USER: You mean we have to re-invent all of those great features inside of a
      brand new window manager?

GURU: What's wrong with that?  You want it you write it.  Go away.

Accessory applets are a great idea --- and I'd like to see them explicitly

A browser is at least half an editor --- probably the most difficult half.

I was being sarcastic about the desktop-publishing standard --- there is no
standard.  There are only a few very popular applications.  People have
gotten use to doing document conversions, dealing with different systems and
just generally not being able to share work.  This is such a great model for
the Web that I can't believe we couldn't see it before.  (*Serious* sarcasm
here... :-)

I liked Bob`s angle.  Is this a correct summary:

	"Don't manage the state with the httpd, manage it with
	 the cgi-bin app."

However, I want to see if I understand his proposal: will subsequent 
messages to the cgi-bin "object" go through the httpd?  This would allow 
a good deal of piggy-backing on the HTTP work, primarily in security.

What ever happened to the talk of binding the HTTP stuff to the OMG stuff?

I think you're both right.

Look, the natural evolution of HTML will go something like this: the 
standard will grow in complexity until more and more programming energy 
will have to be expended to take advantage of all of the features of 
HTML++.. Sure, shareware and pd browsers will be available, but 
commercial vendors will more and more see the opportunity in developing 
browser applications and even browser capabilities at the "OS package" 
level. 

At some point the level of complexity caused by such a diverse 
group of collaborators will scream for a re-design and hopefully someone 
as powerful as Microsoft will step up with HTML+OLE or some such, which 
will also hopefully (and quite reasonably) be backward compatible with 
HTML and come complete with a well-defined API for developers of browser 
applications. X-windows developed out of such an environment. Now, there 
is so much complexity in X (and I would include Motif, Sun, and MS 
Windows as more complex extensions of X), that it has become very costly 
to develop sophisticated GUI applications up from the ground of X.  But 
no one develops user-applications by using native resources to 
develop their widgets. Instead they use .VBX widgets and others made 
available through the richness of Microsoft (et. al.) API toolkits. Have 
you seen some of the apps non-sophisticated programmers are writing with 
Visual Basic? 

My point is this: get HTML out there, allow the complexity to grow. 
Insure that browser-developers can develop simple applications (by 
allowing them to ignore such things as HTML+ extensions), but leave room 
for just about anything some browser developer with a great idea wants to 
throw into the bag (including, yes, formatting).  The more richness and 
complexity we try to add, the more issues will be raised, and the more 
users, their appetite whet by what they see will begin to imagine -- and 
then demand -- what could be. It is that general, public notion of what 
could be which will most influence the next, commercial generation of web 
browser software, and the API tools we'll have available to us down the 
road. 

A final note: "down the road" is probably much closer than many of us 
think. PC Week (6/6:8) notes that DEC has announced bundling Mosaic with 
its NT based workstations, and IBM "is going to put Internet access in 
the box."  As a group, perhaps the most important thing we can be doing 
to influence the success of HTML/HTTP standards is to be working with 
Microsoft now, rather than later.

If anyone knows the right contact @Microsoft to invite into our 
collaboration, please let me know.

Hi,

I don't want to interrupt what I consider to be a very interesting technical
discussion for very long, but I must say that as a developer and an owner
of a small software business that has been active in the software
standards arena, (ANSI, POSIX and X/OPEN), you folks appear to be getting
very close to attracting some attention from the standards community.
My personal view is that the involvement of standards organizations in this
activity might bring some value but that value might have a price.
There is certainly a trade-off here and I, for one, am not sure at what point
in the formative cycle of a world-altering technology such as the web that the
value of standards activity can be maximized and the cost minimized.
I suspect that now is not the right time.

Well, the idea is a gleam in my eye at present. All I wanted to point out is 
that, in my opinion, HTTP is NOT the place to keep state. I think it should be 
kept at a higher level. I agree that HTTP seems to be a good vehicle for 
providing the "request-response" service to whatever the higher-level service 
is. 

If you take HTML out of the picture, HTTP is a useful, flexible service that can 
be used for lots of things. Once state gets into the picture, many of HTTP's 
potential uses disappear. You could argue that new uses appear, but then you 
could argue that making FTP stateless would make it useful in new ways as well.

If you look at what's sitting there in the CGI interface, particularly the 
"extra header" support in CGI/1.1, it leaves open the possibilities of layering 
all sorts of stuff on top of HTTP, which would be used to provide a 
"request-response" service to the application layer.

Containable complexity. Exactly.

So do I. I think we agree more than we disagree.

Yet. There is an interface specification in the works, it has been referred to 
occasionally over the last couple of months.

That is not the same thing at all. It does not follow from what went earlier. 
Please show how going to a distributed model of implementation requires that the 
HTML 3.0 specification be subdivided.

I don't, thats why it wories me.

I think that is what I said, too. Yet you seemed to be arguing that only Frame 
or Microsoft should develop Web software. Perhaps this was a straw argument and 
I missed it?

So what? If Frame can output HTML 3.0 I am happy (I use Frame 4.0 a lot, BTW). 
So it can output HTML better than WebMaker? Fine, if the price is right I buy 
it. I don't see that being able to convert WP to HTML has any effect on, say, 
someone developping an applet for news posting or whatever.

>Then those become popular, the applet market goes away
>and the Web becomes a boring place to live (for a programmer... :-)

Not so. LaTeX2HTML is popular. Did that prevent Fish search appearing? Did it 
stop Chimera coming out? I fail to follow your argument; these issues seem 
nigh-on orthogonal.

a) and you were concerned about document complexity (according to the subject). 
Oh well.

b) I believe examples of this markup have been circulated recently on either 
www-talk or www-html. I confess to frequently being unaware of which list I am 
on (blush). I gather you have to declare the thing using some ghastly syntax in 
the doctype bit before <html> tag.

Anyway it seems we are pretty much in agreement. We just differ on how likely it 
is that a browser can be built as a flock of applets and that applets could 
conform to an interface specification and be portable across browsers. To which 
I would say, when Steve Putz hacked out the Xerox map browser I bet he never 
dreamed that CGI would let the same script work on CERN, NCSA and any other 
compatible server. Proof by related example (grin, ducks)

[By the way... this subject seems to come up quite often... perhaps
the WWW FAQ maintainer(s) would distribute my response through the FAQ
distribution channels]

I've been variously called "the SGML cop" and "the anal retentive
one."  When I go about expressing that sentiment, I usually say that I
consider myself a representative from the formal systems camp to the
WWW community ;-)

Anyway, I'm working very hard to ensure interoperability between WWW
implementations (specifically HTML implementations) through
specifications.

The IETF is the closest thing to a standards body that WWW has ever
been associated with. But it's not clear that WWW standards will
continue to evolve through the IETF infrastructure.

There is an emerging international consortium that will, hopefully,
mediate these things in the future. Contact Tim Berners-Lee
<timbl@info.cern.ch> for details -- but don't hold your breath waiting
for a response. He gets more than a couple pieces of mail every day :-)

Since W3O isn't in place yet, there's a sort of ad-hock committee or
task force, if you will, that's reviewing the HTML spec, which is
badly out of date. The current plan is to publish it as an SGML Open
technical report.

There's also something of a libWWW task force trying to coordinate
development on that body of code. Contact Eric Sink
<esink@spyglass.com> for details.

I would like to see the HTTP spec actively maintained, with some
well-defined and widely understood notion of conformance. Perhaps a
browser spec -- at least a "CCI" spec.

[By the way... are there any publicly available documents describing
the rumored interface between NCSA Mosaic and Adobe's PDF viewer?]

Here's the latest poop on the HTML 2.0 spec review...

Status: In Review

   The HTML specification was last published as an internet draft in July of
   1993. Since then, there has been an enormous increase in the usage of HTML,
   and certain new features have emerged. Widespread commercial support for
   HTML is on the horizion, and while there is a relatively stable set of
   features in current practice, there is no document that specifies them.
   
   These materials comprise an effort to promote interoperability among
   developing HTML implementations, and to investigate interactions with
   implementations that support more or fewer features than the current
   practice.
   
   I believe the document could use some substantial reorganization, but given
   the current time constraints, such editorial matters will not receive a lot
   of attention for some time.
   
   As to the technical issues, after only 10 days, we are still in the up-hill
   phase of the review. I expect the technical issues to be largely stable in
   another week or two.

Oh great. That worries me more than Microsoft. ISO picks it up and before we 
know it there is a DIS of HTML 2.0 expected in 2012! Aaargh. I mean, look at the 
timescale for a C binding to GKS. 

Plus there may be one or two changes happen when ISO take it on board. Look at 
what happened to the ISO standardisation of Modula-2. Then again, maybe they 
will standardise HTML 1.0 and prohibit any changes. Look at ISO Pascal. Or maybe 
they already have a hypermedia system or two .. look at Hyper-ODA, MHEG, PREMO, 
... oh no, I feel most ill.

Unless they can take it and be the _sole_ controlling body, they aren't 
interested, too. Look at what happened to the ISO standardisation of X.

Most of those who are active in protocol development are also active
in the IETF which is the Internet standards body. Currently there
are several Working Groups within the IETF who are working with the
Web and other services. Particularly the groups within the User Services
area: IIIR and URI. IIIR's task is to make sure that all the various services
(WWW, WAIS, gopher, X.500, whois++, etc) all work together and have some
kind of consistent inclusive architecture. URI is the group that is currently
finalizing the current URL specification (which 'should' be out shortly) along
with URNs and URCs (amongst other critters).

So, in response, I would say that WWW is already part of a fairly well
defined and extremely successful standards process. Check out your
local IETF internet-drafts archive for some good examples.

I'd really like to see this interface.  Any idea when it might be
available?  If something like this becomes insanely popular, it might be too
late or too hard to standardize the interface "the right way."  Not to take
anything away from the Chimera developers --- but I would like to see if
their concept can do the things I need to do with a browser.

If it's in the spec that browsers have to be able to start up external
rendering agents and allow for new types and renditions that weren't around
when the browser was created, then we've *guaranteed* that anything called a
Web browser can handle the distributed model.  I want it to be hard and
unproductive to implement *only* a monolithic browser.  That gives small,
helpful, responsive, nimble, creative, energetic, etc. players the advantage
in the commercial (and non-commercial) Web tool market.  If we can specify
things like embedded interactive drawing programs (e.g. the scribble input
field) or embedded word processors (a logical extension of the text field)
then we can just about guarantee that the architecture itself prohibits
monolithic design.

Yes!  The concept of *only* Frame and Microsoft developing Web tools goes
against everything I believe in.  I think there should be a level playing
field --- and we should be making the rules right now.  And I want the rules
to favor companies who produce standard, easily customized, modular software.

Then I would be happy too.  But if 50% of the market starts using Frame
tools because they are so happy with it, Frame could pretty much dictate
what HTML 3.1 would look like.  It might not happen all at once, but it would
happen.

	Press Release:  Frame announces Frame 5.0!  HTML 3.0 fully
	supported!  Edit all of your old HTML documents.  Add value with our
	high technology super impressive whizzy proprietary extra features!

Now people start using Frame and those extra features.  Who is really going
to know what's HTML 3.0 and what's not?  Frame "hides" all that from the
user.

I'm starting to feel like Mr. Gloom and Doom here.  However, I don't feel
off base.  Several people have written me with comments like "Mosaic doesn't
define HTML, I'm glad everybody knows that now."  I don't think everybody
knows that yet!  Look at the "Mosaic and WWW Conference" coming up.  Just
more reinforcement that Mosaic == WWW.  (Not to slam the conference --- I'm
going and I feel lousy about missing the CERN conference.)

LaTeX2HTML is *not* an applet in the sense we are talking about.  It's an
example of a productive authoring tool.  Fish search is a set of diffs for
Mosaic --- so it's not really an applet either.  Chimera is a whole new
browser --- thankfully it is still realistic to build one.  What I'm talking
about is the Frame example above.  Browser X becomes so popular that HTML
becomes equivalent with what Browser X reads.  HTML thus becomes so
complicated that browsers are very difficult to construct.

Now if Browser X is owned by an agressive commercial company, then applets
might not be desirable and the applet market dries up.  Maybe the market
place won't let this happen.  OLE does seem to be picking up steam ---
although I don't know enough about Windows products to know if vendors are
encouraged to use it, or whether it has stimulated an applet market.

Nope.  I was never concerned with document complexity --- I admitted
straight away that it's going to be hard to add fancy new features without
complicating documents.  However, what you just did wasn't complicated!  It
might make a browser complicated --- but only if it wasn't designed into the
architecture to begin with.  Lot's of programs do macro expansion --- this
is no more complicated than that.

I think so too.  It *is* amazing how much is standard in the Web.  I think
this is partly mostly due to the organizations that are sponsoring a lot of
the work.  I also think we were pretty lucky to end up with those
organizations too!

Anyways, there's been a lot of argument about the big mean company taking
over HTML.  Not much discussion at all on my other points.  At this point I
wish that I had never even put in that *one line*!  Maybe I'll repost with
the point removed... :-)

The more a-priori complexities we add to the protocols and formats, especially 
without PRIOR implementations, the closer we move towards de-jure standards (the 
domain of politics and big companies) and the further away we move from de-facto 
standards (the realm of Darwinian invention and innovation, where most of the 
rest of us live).

Relax, guys.  The future is that we will have
browsers that handle arbitrary DTDs using arbitrary style sheets.
Then HTML will continue in use or fall out of use depending mostly
on how well it works for users.

What you see today is only prototyping.

Amen to that! What's more, such browsers will not be a whole lot 
more complex than the ones we have now!

I noticed that The Listserver for WWW-talk and WWW-html is not
perserving the In-Reply-To headers, e.g.

In-Reply-To: <9406161944.AA02482@ulua.hal.com>

So, unless people put these references in the body of the message, they
are going to get lost.  Bad.

If these were preserved, then the archive maintainers could do better
threading (e.g.,
http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-talk-1994q2.messages/970.html)

There are probably other useful headers that should be preserved, like:

	X-URL

	X-URI

	Included-Messages

Basically, any header that refers to a MESAGE-ID or some kind of URL/URI
should be preserved.

Yes!!!  I keep dreading the cycles it would take to thread messages by
looking for the quoted text.

By the way, if anyone has has had trouble trying to reach my site over the
last week, there have been frequent interruptions of my service thanks to a
power hit at Portal.  Things seem to be somewhat stable again.

The archive menus contain only the most recent two weeks of messages.  I'm
working on a hooking in a full-text retrieval system for the older stuff.
You can still backtrack through the threads, however, to reach parent
messages and then all replies, regardless of age (click on the title to go
to the parent).

I've noticed a really awful bug in my code that makes URLs in messages hot
-- it's not including "ftp" and other types except http when it creates the
HREF anchor, so none of the others work...  I'll fix that tomorrow.

For reference again, my home page is:

http://198.92.133.3/

The top indexes for Web-related lists are at:

Ugh.  My point that the current HTML+ proposal is best suited to be
implemented by a "major player" was meant to be a reason for making HTML+
much simpler, more modular and easier to expand.  I thought it was *so*
*obvious* that domination by a "major player" was *bad* that I didn't
clearly explain myself.

That's my experience too.

This is a Good Thing.  Look how far current Unix is from the original...
with the exception of what some commands are named, there isn't a whole lot
of similarity.  Without the tremendous influx of new and creative ideas,
Unix wouldn't have survived.

The historical problem of course was the fact that there were so many
incompatible variants.  This made even easy things hard.  The existence of a
standard operating system API helps solve (not cures) the portability
problems for the well-known segments of operating systems that people use.
It does not prevent anyone from building better implementations or adding
extra features.  I want HTML+ to do a much better job.  :-)  HTML+ can do
this if it standardizes the extension mechanism.  X does a pretty good job
at this --- look how many vendors have added some proprietary doo-dad without
breaking compatibility with X.

I think that this is accurate.  That's why we need to make sure that HTML+
itself limits the ability of "a major corporation" to produce a non-simple,
non-modular, non-expandable variant of it.

Actually, I think rather than seeing someone like Microsoft come in
and appropriate HTML et al, we'll see entirely different systems..
Kaleida is promising a distributed version of their ScriptX system,
which is able to cleanly and synchronously meld video, sound, and other
data streams.

The information highway is young enough that we have no guarantees that
the main thouroughfares have even been laid out yet.

I'm not aware of any existing object-oriented data models for
HTML-documents.  There was a short discussion on the
convergence of HTTP and object oriented systems in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Bugs/Objects.html.  

The "Reform of SGML" suggested by Tim Berners-Lee, which appears in
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/SGML/TimComments.html, may
also be of interest.  This note suggested some possible changes to
the SGML syntax.  Starting with this idea, you might want to
investigate replacing the SGML markup with Python object constructors
as a means of defining your object-oriented data model of HTML.

There's a short example attached that illustrates nine HTML elements
(P, Header, H1, Title, A, Dl, Dd, Dt, and B) coded as Python classes
and a second example that uses these classes to markup a document
using Python constructors.  A couple of the elements don't print out
yet, but the linemode() method does mimic the output of the line mode
browser for some of the elements.  The program uses multiline strings
so be sure to use Python version 1.0.2.

Given this example, it seems reasonable that Python might be a good
choice for a client side CGI scripting language for WWW.  WWW
applications could be extended to accept the Python by embedding the
Python interpreter as an alternative document input parser.  Python
aware applications could then read documents written in either the
HTML or in the Python .py file format and the Python .pyc format. (The
.pyc format is a byte compiled version of the .py files.)

Documents written in Python could incorporate active elements that
would be executed in an isolated environment on the client side.  This
would allow domain specific functions to be included in a document,
such range checking of form input fields.  This could also facilitate
the ability to redefine of the markup language on the fly by making a
collection of client display widgets available that could be used by
Python class definitions of elements to display the content of the
document.

I agree with Terry when s/he says:

In fact, such browsers already exist in the form of most commercial SGML
products.  It's a relatively small task to extend the interfaces of those
SGML tools to be HTTP-compatible (at least I hope it's small 'cause I need
to do it :)

Once these tools are available as Web clients (and hopefully with HTML as a
compliant DTD), the complexity will be completely hidden.

I think this will be the state of the Web world in 1 yr or less.

I think it would be helpful to demonstrate what I'm after in HTML+.  Here's
a *very* simple HTML example:

------
<ul>
<li> first
<li> second
<li> third
</ul>
------

Looks pretty harmless doesn't it?  Now as a user I might want to configure
things.  The browser may let me change the fonts, sizes, colors, bullet
shapes, etc. that are used to render the list.  The author doesn't really
get to do anything except control the order and that fact that it should
should not be numbered.

I think that this is quite a lot of functionality.  HTML looks pretty good.
Individual browsers may not allow as much control as what I mentioned, but
this is pretty easy to implement and there are quite a number of browsers
that I can choose from.  Chances are *somebody* will do something that I
like.

There are alternatives to the HTML example though:

------
<vbox style="list">
<hbox> <img style="bullet"> <p style="item"> first </p> </hbox>
<hbox> <img style="bullet"> <p style="item"> second </p> </hbox>
<hbox> <img style="bullet"> <p style="item"> third </p> </hbox>
</vbox>
------

I know this is ugly!  Please bear with me... ;-)

It has an advantage over the first example in that it is building a list
structure out of more general elements.  There are three types of geometry
managers (or packers) in this example:  the vertical box manager (packs
boxes into a column), the horizontal box manager (packs boxes into a row),
and the paragraph box manager (packs boxes into a paragraph shape).  There
are only two visual elements:  inline image and text.  Everything uses the
attribute database via the style attribute.  This provides information the
browser (or a rendering agent) uses to figure out how to "draw" an element.
(Where "draw" might mean how wide the margin should be, how loud the volume
is, whether footnotes are popped up or scrolled to, etc.

(Aside:  I would also add one more geometry manager:  the plain box, which
simply puts it's children where ever they want to go.  This manager would
allow overlays for example.)

A lot of things just "work."  For example, since paragraph text can flow
around any box, and the list is in a box, text could flow around the list.
There's no need for special cases in the layout code:  everything is some
kind of box arranged with a geometry manager.  Tables become part of the
general case:  they are just <grin> collections of boxes with horizontal and
vertical rules between them.

I would be the first to admit that there must be sophisticated layout
algorithms (especially for the paragraph manager) to handle this
architecture.  However, once good sample layout algorithms are designed, this
should not be a problem, since additional rendering and layout algorithms
can be easily integrated.  The layout algorithm, much like the data transfer
algorithms in libWWW, should be fairly easy to provide in library form.

It's extremely extensible.  Each visual element (possibly each geometry
manager) is associated with a rendering agent.  This agent may be internal
or external.  The agent is identified via HTML element and/or MIME type.  A
simple browser might not render a box if it doesn't know how.  An advanced
browser might ask the user questions on how to render an unknown type ---
e.g. ask the user whether they want to download another rendering agent.
The document might even provide hints as to where they can be found (maybe
through the existing SGML mechanisms.)

The attribute database can be customized by the user or the author.  Authors
provide style tags in the text and a default attribute database.  The
default attribute database is merged in with the user's database.  This
gives the capability of "style sheets" --- but is more general since the
attribute database can specify a lot more than just style.

Now to address the ugly part:

There should be a simple macro language to do the conversion:

<ul> { <vbox style="list"> }
</ul> { </vbox> }
<li> text'itemTokens { <hbox> <img style="bullet"> <p> text </p> </hbox> }

Ignore the syntax, I don't really care what it looks like.  This example is
Bertrand'ish.  It would be reasonable for it to be m4'ish or prolog'ish or
Tcl'ish.  For this to be easy to implement, we will need to define what the
terminal tokens (and types) are.  If documents are able to introduce
arbitrary new types (like itemTokens from above) browsers will have a much
tougher time...  I know that SGML has some capability in this area, but I
don't know how complete it actually is.  Ideally, we should be able to test
out syntax changes for document authoring without ever changing a Web
browser.  For instance, I can see where a *lot* of table proposals could be
experimented with.

I know there are going to be complaints about how little "structure" there
is in this proposed direction for HTML.  My argument to this is that there
shouldn't *be* a lot of structure for a viewer.  There should only be
"viewing" structure.  If you want additional structure, use a DTD suitable
for the subject (e.g. a legal contract DTD) and then convert it to HTML for
viewing.

I appologize if these ideas have come up before.  I figured if they had I
would have seen some (however slight) influence on HTML+.

One last thing:  I have to agree with Marc Andreessen on the thought of
standardizing existing practice before charging ahead with a new and
radically different HTML.  I guess this means that HTML+ == what Mosaic
handles.  Although, maybe the paragraph tags should be fixed anyway? :-)
Perhaps I'm arguing about HTML 2? 3?

As food for thought, let me throw this in:  if I could tell the art people
here that they could Quark Xpress files seamlessly into HTML files (sans
hyperlinking of course) because everyone out there has a free plug-in
provided by Quark that does the rendering into every Web browser (and if
people don't have it they can get it from our site anyways), they'd do
backflips. 

Build a strong, portable, efficient API, and encourage ALL vendors to
build plug-ins to the API for their products.  Then HTML++... won't have
to try and become a page description language, it can stay light and easy
to use as the lingua franca.

How timely that you should mention python.  I have had a great number of 
ideas in my head, and have been wondering whether to try them in python, 
tcl, or smalltalk.  I want to learn smalltalk, but the GNU implementation 
doesn't do sockets.  Iwant to get some work done soon, so I am leaning 
towards python (it has stuff for www already).

The things that you wrote are *very* true.  Mind if I tag along with what 
you're doing?

Python is cool. Tcl is quick-and-dirty, but doesn't scale well.
(the Tk canvas widget sure is neat... too bad we have to build
products using OSF/Motif's libXm and Tk doesn't interoperate)

Anybody checked out Modula-3 and Obliq? See

	http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/drafts/web-research.html#obliq

I've done quite a bit of work with python... I've linked several
modules from libWWW into the python interpreter... SGML.c and
HTML_DTD.c, for example.  So I can parse HTML using C code, and do
other stuff using python. Guido also integrated motif and the HTML
widget into the pythonn interpreter. So you can build nifty Web
clients in no time. I added SOCKs support under Guido's libHTTP and
stuff. Works great! I only wish I had time to prepare it for
distribution...

You should also check out WINTERP, if you're into rapid-prototyping
environments.

I look forward to the day when in stead of everybody shipping diff's
to the mosaic source code, we can just install little interpreted (or
dynamically linked) modules -- kinda like the Andrew Toolkit module,
but with sufficient industry support that folks are willing to base
products on the technology. Folks should be able to combine modules
in the same process or in separate processes.

Check out the ILU project too...

	ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html

Also... we need to get this CCI stuff rolling quick: we need a
hypertext clipboard in X, drag-and-drop stuff... even perhaps
secure RPC between client applets.

Has the NCSA Mosaic development team made their CCI ideas available
for review?

exactly the point I made yesterday.  Let the richness and complexity

ignore its place as prototype.

Why shouldn't they have hyperlinking capabilities?  Just overlay shaped
regions on top of the image.  Or, create an associated hyperlink file that
the rendering agent for Quark Xpress would use like this:

  Web Browser:  Hyperlink at (x1, y1)?

  Rendering Agent:  (looking in hyperlink file) No.

  Web Browser:  Hyperlink at (x2, y2)?

  Rendering Agent:  (looking in hyperlink file) Yes, the URL is foo://bar/

The Web browser might ask the question to the rendering agent whenever a
user poked the image with a mouse.  Other commands like "search this" and
"print this" also need to be defined so that external data is not second
class.

This is why we need a standard interface to rendering agents!  I expect the
addition of hypertext markup to non-markable documents to be very common.
There should probably be a standard way of wrapping data with hyperlink
information.

Could be one provided by Quark.  Could be a competing implementation.  They
would all work in everybody's browser.  The resulting applet market would
really take off.

It doesn't have to be an API.  It could "merely" be a protocol specification
or something equivalent.

This is *exactly* the kind of usage for HTML I had in mind with my original
posting.  HTML becomes "simply" the glue that holds documents together in
space and time.  The spatial organization comes about through the
interaction of geometry managers with rendering agents.  The time
organization is achieved through the linking and navigational structure.

This is very close to the tack that we took in the COSE CDE Help
System.  We have a DTD for markup specifically tuned to on-line
presentation called the Semantic Delivery Language or SDL.  SDL by
design was not intended as an authoring language, rather, it was
intended to be translated into.  The idea being that certain things
such as the location of IDs could be computed during the translation
process rather than at run-time to allow more rapid random access into
the document.

On of the (few) elements of SDL is <form>.  The SDL <form> is not at
all like the HTML3.0 <form> but is more akin to the Motif form widget.
That is, the SDL form specifies layout of <block> or <form> elements
in a grid.

The definition of <form> in SDL is attached at the end of this note.
Two of the attributes of <form> are CLASS= and SSI=.  The SSI=
attribute stands for "source semantic identifier" and is used to
indicate the function in the source DTD that this use of <form> is
filling - that is, it is very close to being a ROLE= attribute.  The
CLASS=, SSI= and LEVEL= (whether explicit or computed as the recursive
nesting level of the <form>) are used to look up formatting
information in a style sheet known as the <toss> (table of semantics
and styles) that is also an element in the document.

The <form> element can be used, for example, to build both tables and
lists.  Recursion of <form> elements allows for sub-tables, lists of
tables, etc.

Subject: Mosaic v2.0alpha5 Release
content-length: 7640

We are happy to announce the release of  NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows
Version 2.0alpha5.  NCSA Mosaic is a network navigational tool that will
allow you to easily access networked information with the click of a button.
Mosaic is capable of accessing data via protocols such as HTTP, Gopher, FTP 
and NNTP (Usenet News) natively, and other data services such as Archie, WAIS, 
and Veronica through gateways.  NCSA Mosaic was designed to provide its user 
transparent and seamless access to these information sources and services. 
There are two flavors of Mosaic:

	wmos20a5.zip  -> Win3.1, WWG & NT (iX86 processor)  
	decmosA5.zip  -> NT on the DECpc (alpha processor)

As many of you know, the initial developers on the Mosaic for Microsoft
Windows project have left NCSA to pursue careers in the commercial
world.  Chris Wilson has joined Spry Inc. based in Seattle, Washington,
and Jon Mittelhauser has joined Mosaic Communications Corporation
(MCC) in Mountain View, CA.  We wish Chris and Jon the best in their
commercial endeavors.

In the mean time, NCSA has increased it's level of support for the Mosaic
for MS Windows project by providing the funding to hire three full-time
developers for the MS Windows platform. Among the most recent
additions to the Mosaic team are Briand Sanderson, who has been with
NCSA's HDF group for almost 2 years, Ryan Grant from  the PC Telnet
project, and Darian Woodford from the Windows Telnet project. There are
many planned enhancements for Mosaic in the future, and NCSA is
continuing to look for more excellent programmers for the Mosaic project.
[See the URL: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Jobs/4121.html]

We've spent these last two months getting a new development team together and 
addressing some of the bugs that were introduced in the previous versions of 
Mosaic.  Here's what we've done:

 Bugs Fixed
-----------
   o There were two large memory leaks which occurred whenever an
     inline image was decoded and displayed. These leaks were approx. 
     1,000 bytes each.
   o The document view window was being drawn incorrectly whenever the user was
     at the bottom of a document, and Mosaic was re-sized. 
   o XBM images are now properly read and do not result in an ERROR graphic.
   o XBM images used to require a LARGE amount of time to decode. The
     code was re-written and now .xbm's decode approximately 100 times faster.
   o The Printing bugs; large files, images, bold text, .txt files.
   o Some minor problems with dialog boxes were fixed.
   o The CRASH caused by incorrect HTML, <dt><dd> tags without the <dl> tag,
     was corrected. Mosaic is a little more forgiving, but not much.  ;^)
   o The navigate back should now take you back to the last document viewed. 
     Previously, Mosaic did not update the history when users accessed 
     documents that were cached.
 

 Enhancements
--------------
   o It is now possible to edit the Document URL line directly to enter a URL.
     Enter the URL and Press return will open the edited URL.
   o The Vertical Scroll Bar is currently a permanent fixture on the
     document view window. This eliminates an extra screen redraw which would 
     occur whenever the user went from a short document (less than one screenful) 
     to a long document or vice versa. Ideally we'd like the vertical scroll bar
     to be dynamic without the extra redraws, but this will improve things for now.
   o The buttons on the button bar are now in color.
   o The "FIND" button was redrawn with a more intuitive picture. It used to
     look like a thermometer and may have lead people to believe it was for
     the hotlist.


Version 2.0alpha5 is available through our home page,

	http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/HomePage.html

or from our anonymous FTP server, "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu" (141.142.20.50).  You can find
Mosaic, wmos20a5.zip, in the /PC/Mosaic directory.  You can also find Mosaic on
the anonymous ftp server ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/winsock directory.


We hope you enjoy this latest version,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			    GENERAL INFORMATION
			    ===================

- NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows is a WinSock client program.  It requires
network (TCP/IP) access through the WinSock DLL interface.  If you are using
Windows NT, this is built in. If you are using Windows 3.1, you need to
obtain a WinSock and install it on your system.  If you are running a
commercial TCP/IP stack, such as FTP Software, Novell, PCNFS, etc., you
will need to obtain that vendors winsock.dll.  If you need a winsock.dll and
you would like to obtain a shareware product called the "Trumpet Software 
International Winsock", you can find the latest version at ftp site, 
ftp.utas.edu.au.  The file winsock.zip is in the pc/trumpet/winsock directory.



- Version 2.0alpha5 is also a 32-bit application and it requires the win32s
software.  Win32s allows you to run 32-bit Windows applications, which do
not use Windows NT-specific features, under Windows 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups.  Win32s was developed by Microsoft and it is freely distributed
to licensed users of Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups.  This software is 
currently under development at Microsoft and their latest release is version 
1.1.5.  If you don't have it, GET IT.  If you are using an earlier version of 
Win32s, this latest release will improve both the speed and stability of your 
32-bit applications.  We strongly recommend you upgrade to this latest release.  
The Win32s software is freely available to licensed Windows users from the
anonymous ftp.microsoft.com.   You can find the file win32s115.zip in the 
/developer/devtools/win32sdk directory.  For the convenience of our users we 
mirror a copy of this software on our ftp site, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  However, we 
have added a readme file and we've re-zipped it into a file called win32s.zip.  
You can find win32s.zip in the /PC/Mosaic/ directory of our anonymous ftp server.  

       *******  WIN32S MUST BE INSTALLED BEFORE YOU RUN MOSAIC  *******



- Your comments on NCSA Mosaic are important; user feedback is an
integral part of the Software Development Group's (SDG's) planning
activities.  Bug reports are particularly valuable because SDG's tests
cannot duplicate all user environments and equipment configurations.
Bug reports should include enough information to enable SDG developers 
to reproduce the problem.  Please specify any information given by Mosaic, 
and give us a URL so we can try to reproduce the problem.  However, before 
you send any bug reports, comments, or suggestions, please check our on line 
information to ensure your information has not already been reported.  This 
will be very helpful to us because we are swamped with email.  You can find
on line information about known bugs, enhancement requests, FAQ's, viewers,
etc. from our home page.

If the answer to your question is not included in the above sources of
information, then please email us at mosaic-w@ncsa.uiuc.edu and we will reply 
as quickly as we can.  Please remember we are supporting NCSA Mosaic and we

It's OK, but now that I've got the ILU interface to Python (in
alpha-test at PARC -- thanks, Denis), and Python Tk (still in a state of
flux, but already useful), and mongo amount of stuff already in Python
(check out ftp://ftp.eeel.nist.gov/pub/python/dbhash.tar.gz for a nice
implementation of general hashing with stable storage, much nicer
properties than the standard dbm module), I don't see much sense in
using anything but Python for prototyping.  And final products, for that
matter.

> Python is cool. Tcl is quick-and-dirty, but doesn't scale well.

Note that the Tk canvas widget was stolen (with attribution) from Joel
Bartlett's ezd, which is even neater (see
ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/ezd/techreport.psf.Z, which is a
compressed Postscript file).  The emerging Python Tk is gradually
eliminating all traces of Tcl -- everything's done in Python.

As a teaser, here's the Python code to find and return a Calendar
Manager object, via ILU, to manipulate the SunOS CM:

# module findCM -- find a calendar manager
pm = {}

def findCM(machine='localhost'):

	import PortMapper		# ILU interface to Sun portmapper
	import CalendarManager	# ILU interface to Sun CM

	global pm

	if not pm.has_key(machine):
		# instantiate portmapper object on machine "machine"
		pm[machine] = PortMapper.T('0@'+machine+'_PortMapper@sunrpc_100000_2|tcp_'+machine+'_111', None)
	cm_spec = {'port': 0, 'prog': 100068, 'vers': 3, 'prot': PortMapper.UDP_Protocol}
	# ask the portmapper what port the calendar manager is using
	cm_port = pm[machine].GetPort (cm_spec)
	if (cm_port == 0):
		raise NoCalendarManager, cm_spec
	# instantiate the CM
	return CalendarManager.CM('0@'+machine+'_CalendarManager@sunrpc_100068_3|udp_'+machine+'_'+str(cm_port), None)
# end of module findCM

Hello all,

After some prompting from Martijn Koster and Oscar Nierstrasz at WWW94,
I decided to rewrite the core of MOMspider so that it can serve
as a generic library for WWW clients written in Perl.  So far (version 0.11)
it includes support for all of HTTP, file://localhost/..., and any
request sent to a proxy server. 

I am looking for more contributions to support the many other protocols
and also to provide better HTML libraries.

The distribution site and much more information about the libraries
can be found at 

       <http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/>

and also at

       <ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/libwww-perl/>

Please take a look and tell me what you think.

I see (comp.archives) that a cross-platform RTF viewer is now
available.  Is it time we thought of turning those people who want
control of presentation over to using RTF, and incorporate RTF support
(with minimal extensions, possibly as invisible text or similar) to
include hypertextual linking.

The styles in RTF could give semantics, and the presentation is all
that publishers want.

The list might seem a bit spartan but the list of new features also
includes the list from CERN Common Code Library 2.16pre1.

* Added -reformat option to allow www to be used for generating HTML in
  canonical form for running diffs, putting into code management
  systems, etc.

* The Browser now understands the "ALT" tag in inlined images</A>

* Improved help. The "Command Line Help" gets loaded if the browser is
  called with the parameter "-?" or "-help".

* Bug in understanding "-p" and "-w" with and without spaces between the
  number fixed.

On second thought, yes, that was a mistake - I had said that simply in the
frame of "Quark doesn't have hyperlinking now...", to defer arguments against
it and in favor of a complex HTML++ scheme.  I was also thinking that the
interface questions (i.e., highlighting Quark objects which are hyperlinks,
then making them a different color once they've been selected) didn't have
to be addressed now.

I'd prefer to keep it in the Web browser, for efficiency and
simplicity reasons.  I had heard there was talk about putting the
ISMAP functionality directly into HTML - instead of calling an
imagemap script on the server side, the map of polygon spaces to URL's
is delivered within the HTML file itself.  This would be a Very Good
Thing, people - this is also how we could overlay hypertext
capabilities on objects like Quark files and such (polygons being
defined as either pixels for bitmapped inlined stuff or in percentage
points for non-bitmapped objects).

It would probably have to come from the company that owns the
patent/copyright on the language - try doing that for PDF and see if
Adobe doesn't give you a phone call... :)

    Hola!
    
        I'm setting up a www server here. I have succesfully 
installed a ISMAP and I'm almost ready to say: "hello world" 8). 
It's really amazing the things this system is capable to do!.
        I have read about the bots, spiders, and other programs that 
can be used to retrieve information through the web; I'm really 
interested!. 
        I now have a little problem. When I see a html of interest, 
I would like to retrieve it, to read it locally and avoid to connect 
a lot of times. If the page doesn't have too much links it can be 
done by hand, but if it's very leafy (with local Links) I think that 
surely there is a perl (or C,...) program that can retrieve the html 
and all its local links. or even better, that works like mirror, 
using the dates to make updates, etc... am I right?... if don't, I'll 
try to do the program by myself 8).

                                  Saludos:

That's what a caching proxy is good for, isn't it?

I think this is an excellent idea; at least someone should be looking at 
RTF to do a quick kill analysis -- is RTF suitable for the kinds of 
formatting we think we want in HTML?  Is there anyone who has enough 
knowledge of both RTF and ongoing HTML formatting discussions to

My previous example was extremely simple.  Here's something a little more
complex.  This is a table example from Dave Raggett's current HTML+ proposal:

--------
<table border>
  <caption>A more complex table</caption>
  <th rowspan=2><th colspan=2>Average<th rowspan=2>other<br>category<tr>
  <th>Height <th>Weight <tr>

  <th align=left>Males <td>1.9 <td>0.003 <td>yyy <tr>
  <th align=left>Females <td>1.7 <td>0.002 <td>xxx
</table>
--------

I really like this.  It's clean and neat --- pretty easy to understand.
Rows and columns that have been "spanned" effectively disappear.  I think
that most things could be placed inside a cell, including a sub-table.

The table system does introduce quite a few more tags though.  And it seems
that a lot of this functionality is very similar to what lists do.  Here's
what I consider to be a more general implementation:

--------
<!-- I don't know exactly how people want to implement the style database,
     so this should just be used as a concept.  The database should probably
     appear in the head, but it's also useful to define style attributes
     where the entity they refer to appears.  The styles used in this
     example would probably be standardized by the HTML specification. -->

<style>
*caption.align: center
*label.weight: bold
*table*border: 1
*table*p.align: center
*table*alignCousins: true
</style>

<!-- Cousins are children of different boxes which are children of the same
     box.  A browser creates default cousin relations between boxes.  These
     relationships are useful during the layout algorithm.  They can be
     explicitly defined for special effects. -->

<vbox>
  <p style="caption">Table 1: A more complex table</p>
  <vbox style="table">
    <hbox>
      <br> <!-- The break element creates an empty box.  <p> </p> works too -->
      <vbox>
        <p style="label">Average</p>
	<hbox>
	  <p style="label" id="hcol">Height</p>
	  <p style="label">Weight</p>
	</hbox>
      </vbox>
      <p style="label">Other Category</p>
    </hbox>

    <hbox>
      <p style="label">Males</p> <p cousin="hcol">1.9</p> <p>0.003</p> <p>yyy</p>
    </hbox>
    <hbox>
      <p style="label">Females</p> <p>1.7</p> <p>0.002</p> <p>xxx</p>
    </hbox>
  </vbox>
</vbox>
--------

The following syntax extensions make tables easier to work with:

<table> { addAttribute(*Box*border: 0); <vbox style="table"> }
<table border> { addAttribute(*Box*border: 1); <vbox style="table"> }
</table> { </vbox> }
<caption> { tableCount is tableCount + 1; <p style="caption"> Table tableCount: }
</caption> { </p> }
<th attr'entityAttributes> text'simpleParagraphTokens
        { if (VboxMode) emit(<hbox>); <p style="label" attr> text </p> }
<td attr'entityAttributes> text'simpleParagraphTokens
        { if (VboxMode) emit(<hbox>); <p attr> text </p> }
<tr> { </hbox> }

These are Bertrand'ish (becoming less and less... ;-), similar to my simple
list example.  One new feature is introduced.  The substitution on the right
is applied when the pattern on the left is matched.  If there are multiple
expressions (separated with semicolons) in the substitution, the "return
value" for the substitution is the last expression.  The expressions left of
the semicolon are merely evaluated for their side-effects.  Please ignore
the syntax if you feel it's ugly --- I don't really care what it looks
like.  (Although you might tell me why you think it's ugly.  ;-)

It may be unclear what the purpose of the syntax extensions are.  I think
they would only be used by people writing HTML by hand.  Maybe the syntax
would be extended in a browser, maybe in an authoring tool.  (If we
standardize a script language, which a lot of people would like to see, then
there's really no reason why the browser can't do it.)  An HTML converter
(certainly an HTML editor) would use the plain-vanilla un-extended HTML
syntax complete with zillions of boxes and paragraphs.  :-)

The previous syntax extensions enable the following table style: (strongly
modeled after Dave Raggett's current HTML+ proposal)

---------
<style>
*caption.align: center
*label.weight: bold
*table*p.align: center
*table*alignCousins: true
</style>

<table border>
  <caption>A more complex table</caption>
  <th>
  <vbox>
    <th>Average <tr>
    <th id="hcol">Height <th>Weight <tr>
  </vbox>
  <th>Other Category <tr>

  <th> Males <td cousin="hcol"> 1.9 <td> 0.003 <td> yyy <tr>
  <th> Females <td> 1.7 <td> 0.002 <td> xxx <tr>
</table>
---------

Comments and criticism much appreciated.

To which Dan Hinckley responded:

That's what this whole thread is about!  If you've missed some of the
postings, I will gladly forward them to you.  In a nutshell, I've been
arguing for (with very little opposition but some misunderstanding :-) a
distributed/modular HTML+ specification that focuses on spatial (coarse page
layout) and inter-document (hyperlink) relationships leaving the rendering
to external specifications and modules.  Of course, the HTML+ specification
would probably include several rendering/presentation specifications in it,
possibly in an apendix.

Hope this helps.

> Can someone explain why this is needed?

The cookie is a token that can be used by the handler to look up information
about this particular instance. For example, it could be a handle to a 
data structure describing this mount point. This allows a handler to 
mounted in more than one place, yet still have a handle to mount point
specific information.

For example, the ismap handler can read in map information when the 
process starts up, and use the cookie to find the table when a request comes
in.

UR* is not a valid C variable name, and John Mallery's already has a lisp
protocol :-)

One change that has been made is that there's now an extra 'version' paramater,
which is an int whose value is the http version multiplied by 100.

The -1 indicates than an error occured, but the gateway has already generated 
its own error. Since there's a function in the support library to generate
errors I could change it to require the gateway to generate the error, in which
case I'd also change the ok result to 200 as well.

I've been havvering about this, and I'm going to try implementing the multi
function model as well to see how it work. The hardest part is designing
the configuration file format ;_)

For this approach, the method specific functions would be the same as 
before, but without the 'operation' paramater. In addition, a catch-all
method handler would be added, with operation redefined as string.

BGI is neutral with regard to single-thread/multi-thread. Since my daemon 
is Multi-threaded, I specified that all handlers must be re-entrant.

I assume that someone has registered text/html as an official MIME

Subject: Re: hyperRTF?
content-length: 1367


I've seen a lot of mail about RTF (some of it duplicates :-) ) but I
haven't seen anybody mention Acrobat. Acrobat is Adobe Systems cross
platform document interchage format based on Postscript. RTF is nice
in that editors are readily avaiable and its fairly easy to implitment
but it also leaves many problems unsolved. The three main ones being:
What happens if the machine displaying the text does not have the
fonts used in the document? RTF has very little support for graphics
and finally Acrobat compresses its data which make better use of low
bandwidth lines. Its problems are currently it's only avaiable from
Adobe (It's fairly cheap but it's not free) and it doesn't support
URL's although it does have some form of hypertext. I think if you are
interested in doing real cross platform formating of documents and
wish to have a high degree of certenty that the documents will be
display exactly the same in all cases you should base the standard
on some form of page description language like Postscript.

disclainer: I don't work nor have I ever worked for Adobe or Microsoft
but I do recieve documents in both formats. RTF is nice because I can
load it into my editor and change it, Postscript usually produces
better looking documents because it supports graphics and color.

Although I think "default_proxy" is a good idea, I don't think it
covers everything. 

The question is what should a "reasonable" client do when it is handed 
a URL with a protocol part it doesn't know. There should be both a 
reasonable default action, and a way of specifically instructing it
to do a particular action. 

In the absense of "default_proxy" or any proxy being set, I think it
would be reasonable to attempt a proxy connection to a http server 
at the same host part address as the unknown protocol URL. (*)

A setting of "default_proxy", or "proto_proxy" would override that
default behaviour. 

The other type of override is with client-side helpers. 
Most clients don't do telnet: themselves - they call another program 
to open a telnet session for them. The list of helpers for output
data types is usually extensible, but I don't think any of the current
clients allow extensible mapping of protocol helpers. 


[ I use imap: in the example below, since that is one of the 
  gateways I am currently prototyping, but the intention is 
  to allow general extensibility of supported prototypes and 
  to not freeze useful URLs at those *currently* supported by 
  Mosaic and other WWW browsers. ]

So, a proposed "reasonable" client, on getting, for example a url:

  imap://user@host/mailbox#message 

where it didn't know how to "speak" the imap protocol, would by 
default ( without any proxies being set ) transform that URL into:

  http://host/imap://user@host/mailbox#message 

And try for the existance of a http-imap gateway on that host. 
( If a host is going to give out imap URL's when that protocol
  is not widely supported by clients, then it is also "reasonable"
  for that host to provide a gateway. But the original URL remains
  a logical access method specifier that will still be valid if and
  when support for additional protocols is added. ) 

This default behaviour could be changed by either the setting of
"default_proxy", "imap_proxy", or by the designation of a client-
side "imap_helper" program. [ And if pine or some other imap 
mailer is given command-line imap URL support, then it could be 
dispatched to access that URL, just as in the current telnet case.]

Note that setting "imap_proxy" to a different host than the one 
in the imap URL would allow a third party gateway. This might be
acceptable for read-only public mailboxes ( and is, in fact, the
main use a present I have for such a gateway, which will probably
only support a subset of IMAP functionality - just enough to fetch
a message out of an acrhive. ) but would make passing plain-text 
passwords (to access a private mailbox by URL) even *MORE* unsafe. 
[ Don't use an untrusted proxy if you are going to pass passwords!]

[ Sorry for broadcasting this so widely: I looked in the newsgroups 
  and mailing list archives and didn't see any discussion of this 
  issue, and I wasn't sure where the appropriate forum was, since it
  falls in the cracks: it has to do with client server interaction, but
  doesn't really have anything to do with the protocol or HTML. It 
  has to do with the interpretation of a URL, but the URL/URI drafts
  seem to intentionally distance themselves from semantics. 

(*) Note: The above would violate the notion (expressed in the drafts)
  that everything after the proto: was an opaque representation.
  However, it is already the case that there is a defacto standard 
  syntax and a defacto semantics for parts of URL's. It is embedded 
  in various libraries of URL parsing code, so it's not unreasonable
  to assume that if a url has a host part, it should follow the 
  proto://[user[:password]@]hostname[:port]/... syntax, even if the
  rest of the following string is opaque.  ]

Subject: CERN Common World-Wide Web Library Version 2.16pre2 Available
content-length: 13549


                          *  *  *  *  *

  The CERN Common WWW Library is a general code base that can be used
  to build clients and servers. It contains code for accessing HTTP, FTP,
  Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system.
  Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting
  hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic programming
  utilities.

                          *  *  *  *  *

This release contains some bugfixes and improvements from the last
release. However, it is still capable of compiling directly with the
CERN HTTP Server and Proxy Server without modifications if the patch
from Rainer Klute has been put in to version 3.0pre6 (this is
basically a change of a function name).

This release should remove the problems with POST, remote host names,
and direct WAIS access - also for the Proxy server.

CERN Common Code Library 2.16pre2 is available, source code:

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_2.16.tar.Z

Its is known to compile on Sun4, Solaris, HP, NeXT, NeXT-386, and
Decstation Ultrix.

Diffs and old versions are available at

	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/old
	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src/diffs

Documentation is available at 

	http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html and

Version 2.16 prerelease 1

New Features and Changed Interfaces

HTTP Client

HTTP module contains the code for the HTTP client. The module is now
reorganized and made more modular. 

Automatic Redirection 
   Now supported by the HTTP Module. The name of the new URL is parsed
   to the client via the error_stack as a ERR_INFO message, see
   HTError module. The maximum number of redirections is set by the
   variable HTMaxRedirections. 

Referer Field in HTTP request 
   Clients are provided the possibility of sending a Referer Field in
   a HTTP Request. This is done by filling out the HTRequest->parentAnchor
   field. 

>From field in HTTP Request 
   Clients can now send the full email address of the current user in
   the HTTP From field. The feature is turned off by default as it
   might get  a bit tricky through a Proxy. 

204 Response 
   Support of return code `204 No Response' 

FTP Client

HTFTP module contains the code for the FTP client. The FTP client has
changed  a lot in this release. It is now a complete state machine
where the actual action executed is a function of the current state. 

The client now follows the suggestions given in rfc 1123: "Requirements
for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support". 

Establishment of the data connection now comply to rfc 1579:
"Firewall-friendly FTP" such that the procedure is 

    1. try PASV 
    2. if that fails, try PORT 

The URL is now parsed according to the (latest) specifications: 

           url     : f t p: / / login / path [  ftptype ]
           login   : [ user [ : password ] @ ] hostport
           hostport: host [ : port ]  
           ftptype : A formcode | E formcode | I | L digits
           formcode:  N | T | C

Both directory listings and file retrieval use the same procedure: 

    1. First try to go to the location directly, as we are often
       talking to a UNIX server or one that 'understands' UNIX syntax 
    2. If it fails, then go to the location step by step using CWD. In
       that way we should not have any problems on any platform, and
       thus it is not necessary to make special hacks for VMS, etc. 

Long directory listings are supported for unix-like systems and VMS.
This includes NetWare and WindowsNT. See Future plans for more and
Directory Listings 

Information from the FTP-server is pr default presented to the client
using the following rule: 

    1. If you are connecting to the root directory at a ftp site, we
       show the 'login' message (might be a concatenation of several
       messages) just like in a normal ftp session. 
    2. If you have a more specific URL, then you probably already know
       the site and are less interested in the login message. Instead
       we show any local message when making a CWD to the right location. 

Gopher Client

The Gopher has been revised and improved error handling has been implemented. 

Information Messages 
   Some Gopher servers send back information messages in a line containing
   "error.host". This information is treated like login information
   from FTP servers so that it is represented as a message before or after
   the actual listing. 

Iconized Listings 
   Listings now contain icons in the same way as the other listings. 

CSO Name Server 
   The CSO Name Server client outputs in HTML and not only <PRE> as before. 

Content Type Recognition 
   The Gopher module uses it's own content-type recognition inherited
   from HTTP when handling gopher text and gopher binary files. This
   means,  that e.g. PostScript files get handled correctly. 

Local File Access

The new version of HTFile module is a lot smaller as all Directory
listing stuff has moved to HTDirBrw module. New error handling has
been implemented. 

Passive and Active Connection Establishment

Calls to connect() and accept() now go through the functions
HTDoConnect() and  HTDoAccept() respectively. 

Cache of Host Names and Addresses

HTInetParse() that is called from within HTDoConnect now has an
internal cache of the names and (possible multiple) IP-addresses of
visited hosts. This minimizes the access to the file /etc/hosts and
the Domain  Name Server, even though aliases are not recognized in the cache.

The default cache size is 500 entries and a host stays as long as a
connect()  succeeds. That is, if connection is refused for some
reason, the host is taken out of the cache. 

The time to make a connection to a multihomed host is measured every
time and  a mean access time is calculated so that HTDoConnect always
takes the fastest IP-address, see Future plans. 

Improved Functionality of DNS requests

The Library now provides functionality for obtaining the full mail
address of the user, full domain name of the host and also the
possibility for setting both values. This means that the user can use
his official email address, e.g. in the HTTP request. 

Long Directory Listings

Long directory listings for HTTP, FTP and files on the local file
system  supported. For the moment only a part of the functionality,
e.g, sorting, which columns to show etc. is exploited, see Future Plans. 

Icon Management

Icons in directory listings are bound to MIME content-types and
encoding.  They can be found in the HTIcons module. The default set of
icons is set up using HTStdIconInit() and new icons can be added
dynamicly  using HTAddIcon(). 

File Descriptions in Directory Listings

File descriptions are supported for long HTTP directory listings. The
default thing is to peek the title of the HTML files. 

Error and Information Message Management

A new error handling module is introduced in HTError. It uses the
error_stack  entry in the HTRequest structure.
It handles nested error messages so that we can give a reason for the
error, e.g. 

    Error in ...
        This error occurred because ...
            This is caused by ...
                etc.

It also makes it possible for the Library to pass information back to
the  client so that the the Library doesn't act like a `black hole'.
An example is HTTP redirection with status code `Moved 301'. Now the
new URL  is parsed back to the client via the error_stack so that the
client can update the reference when possible. 

The function that generates and outputs the error messages to the user
is put into HTErrorMsg Module so that it can be overwritten by a smart
client or server. 

Guessing the Content Type of a Stream

The HTGuess module reads a part a stream and determines the content
type with  the highest probability from a statistical analysis. 

Minor Stuff

tmpnam() 
   Because of problems on NeXT platforms the tmpnam() function is now 
   replaced by HTFWriter_filename() in HTFWriter.c. The function has
   two modes: Give back a hash name or the last part of the URL (which
   normally is more readable). 

HTMLPutImg() 
   New function to make it easier to put out an HTML <IMG> tag. 

HTParseInet() 
   Added one more parameter to tell whether it is a multihomed host or
   not. (This is used in the host cache).

HTInetStatus() 
   Should no more be used directly but is called from HTErrorAdd so
   that the message goes all the way back to the user 

HTError 
   This typedef is now obsolete and will be removed in future releases 

HTLoad() 
   Added new parameter to HTLoad: BOOL keep_error_stack. If YES then
   the error_stack is not cleared. This is used in redirection etc. 

HTLoadError() 
   Because of the new HTError module, this function in HTML.c is not
   needed anymore. 

Bug Fixes

This is a list of fixed bugs from earlier versions. 

* Memory faults in HTSimplify() in HTParse.c has been fixed 
* README files in directory listings now know how to handle '<', '>'
  and '&' correctly. Though the file still has to be ASCII. See future
  plans for handling this file. 
* tmpnam is no more used in the Library because of problems on NeXT
  platform. Instead a new function called HTFWriter_filename() in
  HTFWriter.c is written. 
* HTInputSocket_getCharacter now returns a int and not a char so that
  EOF is no longer a member of the char set. 
* HTMLGen_start_element() is only allowed to put extra '\n' in <PRE>
  mode if it is between parameters in a tag 
* Changed type of <IMG> into SGML_EMPTY so that it doesn't expect end
  tag <\IMG> 
* Nested <PRE> is no more a problem in HTMLGen_start_element. 
* Removed all #elif as not all compilers on HPUX likes it. 
* Changed HTChunk such that chunk->data is '\0' terminated at any
  time. This actually makes HTChunkTerminate less needed but be aware
  that HTChunk->size changes. 
* Removed non-portable d_namlen field in HTMulti. 
* Moved definition of NO_GROUPS to tch.html 
* Moved definition of HT_MAX_PATH to tch.html 
* Proxy server now closes connection in HTTP.c. This was only problem
  in non-forking servers (VMS). 
* Definition of HT_NO_DATA moved to HTUtils.html where the other
  return codes are placed. 
* Functions from HTAlert Module that prompt the user don't get
  confused about ctrl-D anymore. 

On the Working List

This is what we were are working on right now! 

MIME-parser 
   A new MIME-parser that can be used as a general module. For the
   moment there is a large number of individual MIME-parsers, and
   there is a lot of redundant coding. 

Multi-threaded HTTP Module. 
   The implementation is currently in its test phase but as the module
   has been turned completely up side down it still needs some heavy
   testing. Look here for more information on the implementation. 

Multihomed hosts 
   If a connect fails on a multihome dhost then automaticly try
   another IP-address. 

Whois++ 
   Actually a WhoIs++ module has been implemented (thanks to Michael Mealling,
   ccoprmm@oit.gatech.edu) in the library but it is not in this
   release as I haven't found many WhoIs++ servers and that the port
   chosen is 43 just like the old WhoIs protocol, and that makes it a
   bit tricky. 

Future Plans

This is what we are going to implement. If somebody should get the idea of 
writing some of the modules mentioned, it will be appreciated a lot ;-). 
Contact www-bug@info.cern.ch for further coordination. 

README File in directory listings 
   Make it possible to have both Ascii files (using <PRE>...</PRE>)
   and HTML files. 

OS/2 listings 
   Implement long FTP directory listings for OS/2 platforms. 

Multipart retrieval in HTTP 
   This will make the transmission time for documents containing
   inlined images much faster. Some implementation ideas have been
   discussed but a final design is not chosen yet. 

Ideas for New Features

This is what we have not started yet but what we would like to implement. 

Virtual Documents 
   Pass virtual documents as objects instead of HTML files. Then the
   client can choose the best way to represent the data and reorganize
   it without consulting the server again. 

Separation of Protocol Modules 
   The protocol modules should be separated completely from the HTML
   machinery so that it is possible to, e.g., get raw FTP directory
   listings through to the user.

Acrobat uses compression - this is really the biggest difference between
PDF and SPDL. The current version of the specification supports LZW compression
for text, and JPEG for images.

We had some folks from Adobe round this week talking about future plans 
for acrobat that sounded interesting; however, I'm still not convinced that
it has anything to offer over SGML using SPDL style sheets.

The official registration site for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) recognized MIME types is at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/media-types/

The MIME types are also periodicaly published as an Internet RFC.
The latest one is RFC 1340 "ASSIGNED NUMBERS".

Last time I checked text/html had not been registered.

After several false starts, including forays into FIFOs, TCP, and X
events, I have finally found a model for WWW `accessories' that looks
simple, yet powerful.

The current state of my ideas can be found at
<http://www.let.rug.nl/~bert/W3A>

Briefly:

It is an interface (API) between a WWW browser and `applets' which can
implement protocols, conversions, viewers, hotlists, and other
utilities. It is based on dynamic linking and a stream model (open,
read/write, close).

A browser must export 12 functions. An applet must export 2-7
functions, depending on its type.

Preliminary results show that a minimal browser (without a GUI of its
own) can be written in less than 400 lines, including the code for
dynamic linking. An applet for the Gopher or the HTTP protocol (sans
cryptography) takes about 200 lines.

Could this be the key to unleashing the myriads of ideas about viewers
and accessories that people have, but until now couldn't implement...?
Reactions, please!

I think we need other buttons to express a degree of interest, such as

Seals Of APproval are a must have feature for discussion tools.

Oops.  I replied to the "announcement", and wasn't careful about the reply
address - sorry.  Please do comment.  I was worried noone cared...... :-)

Actually I did port libwww to Windows 3.1 (16-bit) with winsock and it works
OK.  The port was relatively painless (for an old UNIX hack).  Re-writing it
was a tough decision.  The obvious advantage to staying with it was keeping
up with the fast-paced changes in URI, etc.  The problem lies in its
size, complexity, and performance.  After a bunch of fooling around with the
line mode browser (also ported), I felt it would burden a light-weight client
more than the disadvantage of "out of sync functionality".

I am an old X-Window-System developer and it was quite common, when building
the commercial X servers, to re-write major sections of the sample
implementation, especially early on (X11R1).  That in no way detracts from
the value of the sample implementation, as you can't re-write something
without it first having been designed and written.  In otherwords, sample
implementations are critical to good quality commercial products.  If I have
one complaint of the X world, it was that too much of the consortium's time
was spent optimizing the sample implementation when it could have been
spent on standards, new features, etc.  I hope as time goes on, the
W3 Consortium will keep this in view.  It must be hard to hear about
someone criticizing one's "baby", but designing and coding the sample
implementation is the hard part.  Criticizing and re-writing it is easy.

I have separated the xxx -> HTML conversion and re-written the access.
With the exception of not handling the recent new FTP URI features, I believe
it is fully functional.  The compiled size is about 50K, as opposed
to 200K for (non-WAIS) libwww.  It is also noticably faster and is
multi-threaded.

I didn't realize whois++ was not a strict superset.  Maybe it should be
a new protocol (notwhois ?) :-).

Good idea.  But it is still the case that the client will need to be able
to do directly whatever the proxy can do (in the non-proxied environment).
Even a dumb client must still understand raw FTP directory listings.
Therefore, from a client developer point of view, such a proxy feature
doesn't help too much.  Hopefully the world will transition to HTTP and
FTP will become just amusement for us old-timers :-).

Subject: HTML Search Form Question
content-length: 665


I would like to do some Search Form-type work in a Web site.  The way that
I would like for it to work is that the user can enter a search screen and
merely enter and submit a search request.  The system would go out to a 
large list of documents, retrieve the answer set, and display them to 
the user.  If there is more than one hit it would be ideal if the primary
answer set is a list of links to the document underneath.  

Has anyone done this type of work without using WAIS?  If so, can you give
me some hints on how to get started?  If not, I could definitely use some
advice on getting started with WAIS.

Thanks.  Please respond to bryon@meaddata.com.

First, thanks for making this available. Great food for thought.

There are two groups of issues: the interface definition, and the
implementation.

Your implementation is limited to Unix boxes that support dynamic
linking. That's OK as proof-of-concept, but any effort in this area
really should ultimately be usable on MS Windows and Macs too.

But the important thing is to get the interface definition right. Once
you've got that part right, porting it to various languages and
platforms is just a matter of nitty-gritty details.

I've done a lot of prototyping based on the interfaces in libWWW. Most
of my prototyping has been in python, just for rapid development of
ideas. It's also nice to not have to worry about memory allocation
junk while prototyping.

Anyway... you're interfaces are almost like the libWWW interfaces, but
not quite. They lack some things, and in other places, they're just
different in ways that can be resolved:

 * The "objects" in these interfaces (the browser, for example) are
implicit in the function calls, causing the state for the objects to
be stored in global variables.

 * It doesn't allow browsers to "prefer" one format over another.

I can't remember the other interface problems that I saw...

Other issues that I have yet to see satisfactorally addressed anywhere:

 * A hypermedia document architecture that accomodates
   compound/complex documents with links between them. MIME makes a
   good framework for coarse-grained composition (but the multipart/*
   encoding is designed for internet mail, rather than reliable 8bit
   data pathways and so it's not very efficient), and SGML works OK
   for structured text, but something like Bento is probably what we
   really need. HyTime ideas should play a part here too.

 * There is no coherent exception mechanism (i.e. no error handling model)
   (Python's exception model works well)

 * We need two kinds of "safe" programming languages: the
   lisp/perl/smalltalk/python style safe language where the programmer
   can't screw up the runtime system the way one can with C and C++,
   and the safe-tcl/Obliq/telescript style safe language where
   untrusted code can be run with bounded access to resources.

I've been looking into development technologies for allowing folks all over the
net to contribute. Python looks good, but scheme48 from MIT also looks promising,
though less mature. WINTERP-2.0 looks great too.

Check out my research notebook for all sorts of stuff like this:

      http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/drafts/web-research.html

Also, folks might want to check out the python code for the www
browser I used to test out my interface definition work. The python
interpreter I use to run this stuff has Motif, the HTML widget, and
SGML.c from libWWW all linked in. So you won't be able to run the code
as-is. But parts of it should be useful.

      http://www.hal.com/%7Econnolly/pywww

By the way... I'm pretty sure the next release of Mosaic will have
some sort of plug-in interface. I'd sure like to review the design of
that thing before the whole world starts using it! If anybody sees a
write-up on it, let me know!!!

    I think we need other buttons to express a degree of interest, such as
	    "Awful", "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Great"

    Seals Of APproval are a must have feature for discussion tools.

See the WIT entry I put in on peer review schemes.

Meanwhile I have implemented persistent object support for general review
schemes.

It is UNWISE to commit mechanism to a FIXED scheme because there is a large
universe of possibilities here, and no clear criteria for universally
preferring a specific one.

It would be better to provide GENERAL mechanism that can support ARBITRARY
schemes but provide some basic examples for initial use.

So what you want is:

REFERENCE: message-id|urn|url|...

REVIEW-SCHEME: <scheme-name>

REVIEW: <scheme-specific value>

So, you can consider the RESCHERIAN-scheme (agree/disagree) to have five
values, from 1 to 5, with mappings to "Awful", "Poor", "median" "Good",
"Great" You can then center on the midpoint and perform numeric operations to
weight opinions...

If anybody cares about this, we can go into more detail.

The reason is that we had a seriuos hardware breakdown on info.cern.ch. First
a memory failure and then a disk died. We temporaryly replaced it with an old
disk that hasn't been updated for two month. The result was that the list
processor used old mailing lists and hence tried to mail to non-existing 
addresses.

We now have a new disk and recovered the data, so the problem should not 
exist anymore.

Sorry for the inconvenience

My news feed (the University of California system Internet hub for the
southern part of California) neither recognizes this article, nor the news
group referenced above.  Is there a public news server where I might find
this article posted (or any one that will let me connect) ?

Tim - if there is such a host, what would a globally-valid URI look like ?  :-)

You all have _got_ to take the time to track this down and read it.
It's the most entertaining pile of horse shit I've read in months.

Dr. Hart. 
	I am replying to this usenet article, which contained several errors
of fact which once corrected should help reassure you and encourage you 
to keep up your excellent work on the Gutenberg project. 

  I do not have time to deal with all the points that need addressing, but 
I'll try to answer a few of your concerns, and send you a more detailed 
response later.

1) NCSA does not use a Cray as an HTTP server - in fact they use a few 
   HP workstations. The speed of a computer has little to do with how
   much traffic it can place on a network. What does limit the volume of 
   traffic is the speed of the slowest network link. That's why WAIS 
   queries run on CMNS.think.com (a connection machine) don't swap the 
   internet.

2) HTTP and FTP use virtually the same technique for file transfers. FTP does
   not transfer all the file you download over a single connection. Instead 
   the ftp server creates a new connection to the client for each file you
   transfer. Once the connection has been created, both protocols just
   blast the files out as fast as TCP can carry it.

3) There is no plot to ban ISO-676 characters from the internet. If your
   text can be encoded in 676, there's no need to worry; even when the network
   does move to UCS, it will likely be in a way that will allow 676 characters
   to be read as is. Let a thousand cows bloom.

4) When using FTP, HTTP, or GOPHER over a dialup line, you don't have to 
   drop the phone line and redial for every file you transfer. Instead you
   just create multiple TCP connections over the same link. 

5) It is easy to create suites of HTML documents that can be read standalone.
   My hypertext version of the National Performance Review (Al Gore's 
   re-inventing government) was converted to standalone form by putting
   a floppy disk into SunSITE(tm) and just copying the directory. 
   Interestingly enough, this book was originally delivered in serial 
   text form; using a few simple emacs macros, I marked the document up in
   SGML and used that to generate the hypertext version. I have found this
   version to be far more useful than the plain ASCII form, and even to be
   better than the paperback form. Try following the structure of the
   Ash Tray specification without using hyperlinks... 
   

Other people may wish to respond to other points; If not I'll try and 
get back to you soon.

Thanks again for all the great work you've been doing with Gutenburg; I hope
I can convince you that your fears are misplaced, and that hypermedia texts
have a place alongside their serial bretheren.

Simon

THE SUPERHIGHWAY STEAMROLLER IS COMING TO YOU

These articles are still in progress, and your suggestions are to
be encouraged.  Many have already been included and I thank those
who have made them.

Some people will find these entirely offensive, as they feel .asm
files are just so much Jurassic Pork, while others will feel .asm
is the only way to make a computer run efficiently.  [Assembly is
the fastest language other than binary we can write in, although,
it would appear it is a vanishing breed.

Others will find it offensive, as they feel the only way to "Surf
the Nets" is with a GUI [Graphic User Interface] while others can
see surfing the nets with a GUI as comparable to surfing on waves
made of peanut butter.

I have seen good applications of both, and would like to see some
kind of optimization of the combined advantages.


The following is a series of articles I have been working on in a
preparation for changes in computers and networks I was hoping in
desperation would never come; desperation because I would prefer,
in my heart and mind, not to take the time and energy away from a
productive creation and distribution of information on the net to
what I am afraid will be an unproductive non-conversation about a
trend that is sweeping the world.

People are using inexpensive computers that are 100 times more in
capability than the first IBM PCs and XTs, but their performances
are not all that much faster due to the extremely sluggish update
programs and files that have replaced the extremely fast programs
and files of only a few years ago.

A lot of this is because the computer market is no longer for the
educated computer user, an educated computer user would realize a
new program was operating less efficiently than an old one; a lot
of new programs don't tell you how well they are operating in the
areas of speed and storage.

For instance:  my old FTP [File Transfer Protocol] program says a
file was transferred in so many seconds, how big it was, and what
the average rate of transfer was.  [150000 bytes transferred in 1
second at a rate of 150KB/sec]  The new programs do not allow for
such an easy recording of how much data was transferred or length
of time required for the transfer.

As the programs transfer more and more files, to get you less and
less information in fancier and fancier manners, you get less for
your time and your money, especially as more "bells and whistles"
are added to these files.

If the Moguls get their way there will no longer be any transfers
in "Plain Vanilla ASCII" such as this message, other than for the
short Email-type messages.

This means that you may have to transfer as much as the "Complete
Works of Shakespeare" at 5 megabytes. . .just to browse through a
set of cute menus on your GUI [Graphic User Interface] netsurfing
program. . .which will make it more like surfing peanut butter in
contrast to the speeds available with Plain Vanilla ASCII.

In addition, your computer has to spend an inordinate amount of a
job just figuring out how to place the information on your screen
when it is presented in a cute graphic manner, as it also does in
programs in which network connections are made and broken several
times to the same machine during the same job.

Some people think this is a better way than to stay connected for
an entire session, others thing a single connection is best.  The
process is much like what happens if you are running errands in a
car. . .let's suppose you are going to make half a dozen stops in
the next hour. . .and let's further suppose you have someone with
you to run in and out.

The question is:  do you turn off the car at every stop or do you
keep it running?

I am one of those people who keeps it running because I know that
it takes a huge amount of energy to start a car, and also creates
an inordinate amount of wear and tear.

I had the same philosophy about making and breaking the networked
connections for transferring files.  What you save may not be the
equivalent of what you have spent in the process.

[A detailed explanation is below]
[I understand that since I started writing this series, "caching"
of often used files by these programs is taking place, which I am
certainly going to encourage.  It would be even nicer if I should
be able to cache some of these programs myself, so I did not have
to download them and run them every time I logged in, or rather a
program did not have to do it for me.  In my latest ventures I am
downloading the local "front page" to my own PC in the hopes that
the programs will not download and format it again, which takes a
huge amount of cpu time, but so far that hasn't stopped the first
download of the front pages.]

Starting a car takes an awfully great amount of energy that comes
from the battery, goes to an electric motor in the starter, turns
over the engine until it starts, and then lets go.  During this a
thousand amps of electric current could be expended for a time; I
just made a call and found that the new cars are more efficient--
825 amps was the most powerful battery the neighborhood place has
in stock at the moment.  I try to be accurate, so let's say these
cars take 500 amps to start.

To give you a comparison, when you blow a fuse in your house, car
or whatever [or blow a breaker] it is usually because the current
hit 15 amps for a fraction of a second.  Thus running a starter a
few seconds can use up the same amount of energy and gasoline the
car would take to keep running for a much longer period of time.

When you are running an automated downloading program that breaks
the connection after every question you ask it, and you spend the
next few seconds or minutes trying to get a new connection. . .it
will become obvious to you just what I am talking about.

Not only have I seen this in my own experience, but most demos of
these kinds of programs have the same kinds of results, except of
course, that tens or hundreds of people get to sit there waiting,
while the operator gets to explain that this happens sometimes.

My own philosophy is that everything possible should be kept here
. . .here being wherever you are. . .because connections cost the
same as the storage to save the material.

Example:  let's suppose you buy your floppies four for a dollar--
1.44M floppies are available at that price via mail order:  three
for a dollar at the best retail outlet I have seen.

Let's further suppose you want to look at Alice in Wonderland and
that making a network connections costs a nickel [or a penny. . .
around here a phone call from home costs 5.6 cents].

If you dial in with one of these "make connection and break" type
of programs, you may have several connections before you actually
see ANY of Alice in Wonderland.  [I know this is hard to imagine,
especially on the part of those of you who call 800 numbers.]  It
still costs something to someone every time you make a connection
to any phone or machine.

Alice in Wonderland is a short book, and about 10 copies could be
put on one floppy, not counting compression.  If you compress, it
becomes 20 or more copies, depending on your compression program.

The point is. . .it costs MORE to download the file, if that were
the whole point of your connection, than it does to store it. . .
right there with you all the time. . .whether the connections are
open that day or not.

If you got 23 copies of Alice on the floppy you paid 23 cents for
then it only costs you one cent to keep Alice locally.

50 cents for Shakespeare or the Bible.

And the prices are dropping constantly.

However, if you try to download these in HTML, not only will this
take more space and time to download, it will also take more time
to get it onto your screen, more time to search, etc.

Try it sometime.

Are the bells and whistles and the picture of Shakespeare worthy?

I am trying to keep in perspective that only 10% of the computers
in the world are on the nets and that this figure is not changing
very much.  There are now maybe 250 million computers:  and maybe
25 million of them are connected in some manner to the nets; when
there were 200 million computers, only 20 million were, etc.

This perspective requires that distributions of anything intended
for more than a few percent of the population be distributed in a
manner that allows these files to be easily used by those without
a network connection, without 16 megabytes of RAM, etc.

I would prefer to keep the compatibility high and the cost low in
terms of both money and time.

My idea of preparing for 2001 is not to create a library which is
likely to take all the resources of the average computer of 2001,
but rather to create a library that would take only a fraction of
that computer's space and processing power.  Our test Pentium can
search the Complete Works of Shakespeare in a second or two and I
can predict that the comparable computers of 2001 will be able to
search our whole library in less than a minute.  Of course I hope
our library will not be the same size then as it is now.  However
to keep the same level of efficiency the library will be in Plain
Vanilla ASCII until computers and networks with enough power will
be available to include the kinds of graphical bells and whistles
the advertising media would like you to think are feasible today.

The truth is that those will cost a lot, and could bring the Nets
grinding to a halt. . .which would allow for the argument that an
Internet free to all is not feasible. . .

while of course the truth is simply that an Internet carrying all
those bells and whistles to all is not feasible. . .yet.

The question is. . .do we deprive the masses of general education
and literacy so that the top few percent can have their bells and
whistles?  Of course the total bandwidth available is rising, but
the bandwidth available to each person is not really increasing--
and as most of you well know, on slow days it is not unlike an LA
traffic jam.

Ten years ago there just weren't than many files sized a megabyte
or larger. . .now no one seems to think twice about putting out a
"Front Page" that requires a megabyte every time you log in to an
Internet WWW server.  This kind of thing could become a problem a
greater number would recognize if the communication companies get
their way and can charge you more for a line your modem is using,
than for the same line when you are talking on it:  especially if
they can charge your calls by the minute or by the kilobyte.

Probably not so many of you remember when some commerical service
networks charged by the minute. . .at my first computer meeting a
single movie review cost us $13 to get, as we had to go through a
maze of menus to get to it; thus many of the $25 free trials were
total rip offs, since before you knew it, you had already run out
of your $25 and were running up a real bill.  The new offers of a
free month online are much better, when it is really unlimited.

I hear NSFnet is going to be history this year.  Any information?

If everyone on the Nets put in $1, maybe we could save the Nets?

More about all that later, too.


My hope is that three factors will save us from these problems:

1.  Wider bandwidth, of course, and hopefully the generic variety
    will still be free of charge, or very close to it.

2.  Better compression, without having to take huge cpu power for
    uncompression.  Some uncompression is so fast you will hardly
    notice it, others take so long you begin to wonder if it is a
    crash or not, unless it has some indication of progress.

3.  More judicious usage of bells and whistles.

    A.  If a picture is really worth a thousand words then we are
        paying too much for our pictures.  The average word, used
        by Shakespeare, is only 4 letters, five, if you count the
        spaces between the words; how many good pictures have you
        seen that were only 5,000 bytes?

    B.  Sound is pretty much in the same category, except for the
        MIDI type sound files.  Using MIDI, we can put 5,000 MIDI
        files the size of Beethoven's 5th Symphony on one CDROM--
        you can download the 5th and try it out, free of charge.

    C.  Bells and whistles merely go further in creating what our
        media calls the "Information Rich and Information Poor."

        If we keep Shakespeare in Plain Vanilla ASCII anyone with
        a computer is likely to be able to read it for under $1--
        if we add on even one bell or whistle, we eliminate a 90%
        majority of the potential audience simply because they do
        not have the proper hardware or software to read it.



THE SUPERHIGHWAY STEAMROLLER IS COMING TO YOU


Have you heard the rumbling?  Besides on television news, I mean.

The Superhighway Steamroller is coming to you, resulting in slow,
then slower, then slowest computer and network performance.

Have you noticed the FTP rates this year are only a fraction of a
year ago?  I remember FTP rates of 175k/second, but today's tests
showed an average of:

Have you noticed that the "New Kids On The Block" are now "Power-
Users" who take up more bandwidth and answer less of their Email?
The Fortune 500 types never did answer their mail very well and a
leopard can't really be expected to change its spots. . .but does
that mean we have to change ours?

What will happen when they want so much bandwidth there is hardly
any left for you?

It will be the same as following semi-trailers on the Interstate.

What will happen when your Emailbox is full of messages you can't
send a reply to?

It will be the same as the junk mail you get in the paper mail.

What will happen when it takes an hour to FTP 5M because everyone
is using less efficient programs than FTP, such as Gopher, WWW or
Mosaic, or downloading the Internet Radio Program?

What will happen when they download video, not just audio?

The answer is. . .there will be no room left for you. . .you will
be forced either to become one of THEM and pay the price, or else
forced OFF the Nets, and pay the price that way.

The very programs and "programming" that seem to hold the promise
of the future of the Nets are what are killing the Nets, due to a
very low efficiency.  NCSA had to use a CRAY as a SERVER, because
they wanted their Mosaic Home Page to appear every time anyone is
using Mosaic, a Home Page complete with pictures.  This is not an
efficient use of either the Nets or the hardware backing them up.

There is something wrong with the software if it takes so much of
new and expensive hardware to run it.

If a Cray is running full-time, just sending out Home Pages, then
just think how much that is loading down the Nets.

It used to be that computer operators were so valuable that their
jobs ran three shifts, 24 hours a day, back when computers had no
power and cost millions of dollars to run.

Now that today's computers can do so much more, for so much less,
and so many more people are depending on them, there is no one on
duty at night anymore.  Something is not quite right there.

This is attacking the home market, too.  When is the last time an
efficiently optimized program was purchased for YOUR computer?

Do you remember how small and fast DOS 3.X was?  WordPerfect 4.2?
Norton's 4.5?  WordStar 3.X?  PCTALKIII?

Do the new versions really do that much more?

A Research Assistant of mine says that poor programming is meant,
intentionally, to force everyone to buy more hardware in order to
run the sluggish programs.


1.  Increased network delay due to mass amounts of low efficiency
    "programming" and programs on the Nets.

    A.  Internet Radio

    B.  Gopher, WWW, and Mosaic

    C.  The very programs and programming that appear to promise
        the most are the ones that are removing the most.


2.  "No Reply Email" . . . probably in your mailbox now.

    A.  How do you deal with a message you can't answer?

    B.  What happens when it is a commercial message [ad]?

    C.  What happened to "postmaster" and "root" as the place to
        send your replies and questions?

    D.  What about people who never answer their Email?

        1.  If they are just late, it costs them more, why do it?

        2.  If they never reply, should you read their Email?

        3.  Remember the first Email Ad Campaigns?


Can commercialization of the Nets be a self-fulfilling prophesy??

Is An Information Superhighway Steamroller Coming to Flatten YOU?

Is A Superhighway Steamroller Coming to Flatten YOU?


If you have been keeping up with the way the Internet is going at
all these days, you have probably noticed the following:

1.  The media is mentioning the Internet constantly.

2.  The big money players have finally decided the Internet is at
    the developmental stage at which they would like a monopoly--
    i.e. the "Metered Internet" and "Metered Software."

3.  The original Internet providers are being more restricted.


These "incidents" are probably not "accidents" and are probably a
factor in each other. . .as follows:

Premise #1.  Scarcity, rarity and limited distribution have been,
and some say "should be", part of our society, from prehistory to
the remote recesses of the future.

Answer #1.  The Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution and all
other major civilizations are based on non-scarcity and nearly an
unlimited distribution as compared to the severe limitations of a
previous period.

Prediction #1.  The Computer Age will be known more for products,
first as electronic words, pictures and sounds, than for actually
computing anything.  These products will extend beyond flat, two-
dimensional screens and printouts, to three-dimensional objects a
"3-D Computer Printer" will "print" for you.

Premise #2.  The end of scarcity is not always a pleasant event--
as per those who opposed the Industrial Revolution, the Steamboat
and even the Electric Light.  You might not be aware of destroyed
electrical equipment at the eve of lighting New York City; nearly
kept Edison from making his deadline and thus destroying contract
negotiation with the city.  It appeared as though those companies
who controlled the previous lighting method, gaslights, were none
too pleased with progress beyond their own monopolies.

Footnote:  While planning how to keep his dynamos running against
all odds and other efforts against them, Edison is reported using
the term "to keep the bugs out" in reference to keeping the light
system working, a term still in use today's advanced electronics,
and new applications.  "We will make electric light so cheap that
that only the rich will be able to burn candles," was his thought
on the progress he was making.

National Geographic, Those Inventive Americans, p 140

[Sometimes I feel the same way about electronic books.]


Answer #2.  Be prepared for there to be "Information Wars"--about
who controls what information, how soon you get it, how accurate,
and how up to date it is.  "Knowledge is Power" and many feel the
giving away of knowledge is the giving away of their own power as
opposed to merely empowering others; why do you think educational
systems have totally fallen apart?  Why do you think half of this
adult population is illiterate?  [U.S. Report on Adult Literacy.]


Prediction #2.  Copyright Law will become even more impossible to
understand, and more impossible for anything to be Public Domain.
The likelihood that anything copyrighted on the day your children
are born will still be under copyright the day they die.  Patents
are still limited to 17 years.  Is there something I am missing?

Along with copyright; I predict the Internet will become private,
simply because they cannot seem to watch people become empowered,
without feeling disempowered themselves.  In the teaching world,
this should be regarded as:

1.  A simple logical contradiction.

2.  The barest form of hypocrisy.

3.  Breach of contract.

***

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We have before us, in the Internet, a tool to bring
all information to all people, without undue delay;
a tool that is providing ever faster access to ever
increasing amounts of information.

Within a decade it should be able to provide access
to something the size and complexity of the Library
of Congress.

In fact, in certain ways, it already does.


What are the reactions?


Michael Sperberg McQueen, one of the foremost of an
assortment of authorities who spoke at recently the
"31st Annual Clinic on Library Applications of Data
Processing:  Literary Texts in an Electronic Age"*1
said that many scholars are guilty of the hypocrisy
keeping their knowledge to themselves in a business
in which they are supposed to be giving a knowledge
base to the world at large.  He said they fall into
a situation in which they are pressured, by various
promotion techniques, not to share this information
in order to gain more fame and glory for themselves
and for their local departments and universities.

This reminded me of a statement, defining different
kinds of professors in the following manner:

"One kind of [Shakespeare] professor believe he/she
is the best possible professor [of Shakespeare] for
knowing something [about Shakespeare] that no other
person knows, and that to share this information to
the masses would immediately result in a fall from,
as it were, the graces of [fill in the blank].

"The other kind of [Shakespeare] professor believes
that she/he is the best professor of [Shakespeare],
only when she/he teaches the [Shakespeare] greatest
amount to the greatest number of people, regardless
of any other factors."

We have a wide variety of teacher and professor and
librarian and other roles in the Age of Information
Science, and each role includes individuals who are
members of both ends of the spectrum, as well as an
assortment of varieties in between.

I'm sure most of you are at least somewhat familiar
with the "Mrs. Grundy School of Librarianship" type
of librarian or teacher, who is caricatured as this
very defensive old lady who might as well be saying
"You're not going to get any information out of me"
or "You're only going to get what I want to you get
out of this library [or school].

Hopefully, you are also somewhat familiar with this
opposite type, who would do as much as possible for
you, and might call you back three weeks after your
question, having finally tracked down the answer.

I assure you I have been exposed to both varieties.

Now what does this all have to do with the Internet
. . .everything, as we shall soon see.


More of "What are the reactions?"


When they first get on the Internet, some say:

"We are faced with an insurmountable opportunity."

"It is like trying to drink from a firehose."

"I'm drowning in a sea of information."

While others say:

"Come on in, the water's fine."

"You never need thirst for anything again, it's all
going to be here, and it's free."

"Wow, you could spend your whole life in here."

My own personal favorite is something from Grolier's
Electronic Encyclopedia stating:

The question is:  will we be allowed to do this?

What if the Information Superhighway
Becomes The Information Supertollway

At various presentations I have made
about Project Gutenberg I have heard
the question raised as to whether we
are increasing or decreasing logical
distance between the Haves/Have-Nots
with our giving away of the trillion
Etexts that is our goal by December,
in the year 2001.

Their argument is that for people of
little means, that even a phone call
to get Alice in Wonderland is a hard
thing to do, even if no charges were
made on our end of the call.

Recently I had a chance to follow up
on one of these conversations, and I
was pleased to learn that telephones
were finally in service there.

At the time of the question however,
my response was that we could not do
a project such as this any better to
provide information to the masses.

Project Gutenberg is, and always has
been, designed for implementation at
the end of the year 2001, and it has
been based on the kinds of networks,
computers, and other facilities that
time should provide, which should be
such that your local warehouse buyer
outlet "should" be selling computers
with enough space and processing for
the whole Project Gutenberg Library,
10,000 items, to run comfortably.

Project Gutenberg is, and always has
been, designed for implementation in
the majority of computer households,
but has not been tailored to fit the
1% at one end or the other of curves
representing the populations of this
world's countries.

We are doing our best to insure that
our Etexts are readable on hardware,
software and operating system of any
nature one is likely to encounter.

This means we have to avoid any such
particular implementation that would
make them more easily available to a
user of one kind of system but would
make them more difficult to use on a
system[s] of different nature.

However, there is certainly one item
we can all agree on, and that is the
cost of getting such a Public Access
Library, most of which is legally in
the Public Domain, should be free.

Any charges for the creation, using,
or maintaining of such a library are
likely to destroy either the library
or much of its impact on Information
Haves/Have Nots. . .or both.

Most of us manage to stay healthy in
the general aspects of our lives and
need minimal health care. . .yet our
government and also countries around
more of this world say the health of
population is so valuable that these
cares should be taken care of by the
application of universal health care
for everyone.

Yesterday I heard Ms. Hillary Rodham
Clinton say to us for a commencement
speech that 15% of the United States
expenditures were on health care.

Most of us do not manage to learn to
read, write, and otherwise manage an
extraordinary range of knowledge and
skills. . .without intensive school.

Many of us still take it for granted
that we can read and write something
of the complexity of this article.

That is because, even though we were
exposed to it on the news last year,
most of us are still unaware that an
illiteracy rate of just about 50% is
currently obtaining in the U.S.

This is a far greater rate than that
of those without health care, health
being something most of us have been
born with, and prior to the medicine
of the modern era, most of us should
have done without and rarely noticed
it in passing.

Preceding the revolutions for modern
medical revolutions were revolutions
in reading, writing and arithmetic--
upon which the medical revolution or
any other scientific revolution must
depend in a totality beyond which an
argument cannot be made:  after all,
can you imagine modern research in a
medical institution in which doctors
could not write down their findings,
or read the findings of others, make
mathematical analyses, confirm those
findings with other doctors.

Nearly everything we build or use is
dependent on a basic ability of this
communicating and reasoning; without
reading, writing and arithmetic, and
all those disciplines that depend on
them entirely or in part, we can say
little about being civilized.

If we don't defend the Internet, who
else is going to?

He is right about the relative-cost of initial connection setup.
It's just that he's a few orders of magnitute out.  The SHTTP
spec has a nice MIME feature allowing a connection to be reused -
very useful for protocol negotation.

I think he left his terminal unattended...
Mumble - HTML vastly more costly than ASCII mumble...

Over the past few days, I've been hacking away at an implementation of a 
binary protocol suitable for use as a replacement for HTTP.  

I've tried to get rid of the most blatant performance problems; the main 
features are:

One time fast-track 'accept' negotiation, optimised for the usual sitation where
the favoured formats for each media type come from a small common subset-
the accept structure contains a 32-bit wide bit string indicating acceptance of
one or more well-known type, followed by a list of types either not in the 
common-subset, or not which have non-default penalties. 

Speculative transmission of non-requested documents; over long fat pipes, 
connection latency counts for more than 90% of the time delay. Interruptable
speculative transmission allows the server to keep the pipe full if it 
has a high degree of confidence that the client will be issuing a request for
an object. 

Interleaved transmission of multiple objects; hypermedia often requires 
data from more than one stream to be interleaved. 

Unification of similar HTTP methods; several very similar HTTP methods are 
merged into unified GET and PUT operations, with flags to indicate options 
such as check-in and check-out, header only retrieval, and replacement 
vs. adding a link. 

The specification is written in ASN.1; the encoding rules used are the 
draft Packed Encoding Rules (PER), which are probably the best encoding 
rules in all of networkdom. If people are interested, I'll post the ASN.1
and the draft service specification, together with the requisite mods to
BGI.

Professor Hart

I would like to address some of the comments that
you made in your bitnet posting titled The Superhighway
Steamroller.

First I would like to make a statement:
I hear a lot of frustration in your posting. You don't 
have to be helpless. There is alot of customizability
to the Web applications that help them scale to the
little person with a small system across a slow
phoneline. This customizing helps. It isn't as widely
known as it should be. Instead of speaking out against
the new protocols, we should be educating everyone
on how to use them efficiently. I do agree that 
pictures and sound and video should be optional - and 
they *are* optional.

I myself operate from home. I have a reasonably powerful
computer, but only a 14.4K modem. I used to have full
T1 access to the Internet and I notice the difference.
It doesn't mean that I want to go back to the days
where all files were 100K or less, UNIX systems ran
with 4 megabytes of memory (and DOS systems were happy
to have 384K).

The bandwidth of the Internet is becoming heavier.
Some of it *is* due to the new type of traffic. In
some cases this new traffic supplants the old. For me
it is just as easy to retrieve a file via anonymous
ftp through Mosaic as it is from the command line.
Much of the new traffic is due to the use of the 
Internet by orders of magnitude more people. I *want* this
to happen. I would love to see the day when anyone
can have Internet access. We need to manage these 
growing pains. That much is obvious. But it is also
important to remember that many of the people now on
the Internet wouldn't be here if they didn't have 
a user friendly interface to start with. Not everyone
is computer literate. Many are downright computer phobic.
I applaude the new technologies because they put
the information that your organization and thousands
of others publish into the hands of the people that
need this the most - the people that are information 
"have nots" due to lack of computer literacy. 
In my opinion, the sooner we lower this barrier to
entry, the better. I know that it will involve 
some growing pains, but I for one am willing to pay 
the cost. If one more dollar of my money will "save
the nets" tell me where to send it. I will pay whatever
is my fair share to keep the nets in good operating
order. I think that many others will too.

One final item before I begin my response. In 
several places above I have placed emphasis on
words by placing asterisks around them. To write 
that in HTML requires that I surround the word
with <em> and </em> instead. Yes, it is more characters
to type and does add to the bandwidth slightly. But if a 
computer can take that information and present it
to me in a way that emphasizes the text (such as 
italics) without having those distracting characters,
I think the text is more readable and has more meaning.
Words are words. They mean as much or as little as 
you make them.

Here are my comments to your posting.

In this you stated:
> - deleted per copyright -

I agree that the current products that you have concerns 
about are not for the educated user. My concern is why 
this is important. There will always be some overhead
involved with disseminating information off of the 
mountain top and into the hands of ordinary people.
What impact do you expect this additional overhead to have
on your goals? What is wrong with having multiple 
methods for accessing information to meet the needs of
different people?

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

Who are these Moguls that you speak of?
What leads you to believe that "their way" is to remove
"Plain Vanillia ASCII" ?
>From my perspective, I don't see the demise of ASCII. I also
see these new tools using even the '"Plain Vanilla ASCII"
such as this message'. For your information, I read your
message via Mosaic. I have high hopes that within another 
year, I can respond to your message with the same "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" format that it was originally composed in.
One of the most important parts of this new technology is
that it encompasses other forms of technology and media
instead of replacing them.

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

If you were to receive 5 megabytes of HTML information, 
about 4.5 megabytes of that is still the text. In reality, 
HTML adds about 10% more *ASCII* characters to indicate 
the prefered display methods. The significant difference
that you might notice is the rendering time that your
client system takes to display the information. This is
a difference in time far more than a difference in
network traffic.

Next you state:
> - deleted per copyright -

I do agree that it takes more time to render text and images
on a GUI display than on a character-based terminal. However,
I have found that the multitasking advantages of having 
multiple windows at my disposal outweighs the overhead
of maintaining a GUI. 

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

There are two steps involved here. First is the download
of the "front pages". This is usually an I/O bound process,
not a cpu bound one. The workaround for this is to configure
your application to use a "front page" that is local to 
your system instead of relying on the default that the
application calls. The configuration of this would be
specific to your application. If you could give me some
additional information about your software, I could 
assist you with setting a "front page" local to your
system. 

Secondly, there is the formatting of that page. This 
will happen everytime a page is called. The pages are
always formatted at run time. The nature of HTML is that
it can specify general formatting and each platform
will implement that formatting in a manner native
to that platform. The benefit of this is that non-ASCII
information can be shared across a wide range of 
platforms.

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

I don't know the amount of data that you handle or the storage
space available to you. For your purposes that may be true.
However, considering that I tend to use anywhere from ~2 to
~5 megabytes of new information each day and that the use
of floppies costs me between one and two minutes per floppy
swap (there would be somewhere in the neigborhood of 10
swaps per hour) I have effectivly wasted 10-20% of my work
time waiting for data. The cost of the media is not as 
important as the cost of my time. Therefore hard disk 
media would be more effective storage for me than floppies.
However, then there is the maintenance of cleaning up the
data that I don't use anymore. It is more effective for
me to retain a list of pointers and retrieve the data as
needed (allowing caching to store it short term), than
it is to maintain it locally - primarily because of time.

I must confess here that I have previously worked at Sun
Microsystems. Their motto "the network is the computer"
is not just external hype. They live, work and in general
exist because of the resources on the net - not the resources
on their local system. It is a paradigm that I have come
to appreciate very much.

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

I agree that there is always a cost for connections to 
machines. Everytime that you make a request some negotiation
and acknowledgment must occur whether it be for ftp or 
http. If you want to cut costs here, develope a udp version
of your favorite protocol. This alone will save dozens of 
acknowledgements for everything that you transfer.

As for costing for each phone connection, well I tend
to stay connected phoneline-wise 24 hours a day. Most
full Internet connections do. I also foot the bill for
my connection. I am lucky enough to have flat rate
phone service, I pay one fee per month for all local
access. I would be curious to find out which of the
baby Bells doesn't provide that type of service.

FYI - the cost for my Internet connection *and* phone
line charges works out to be about $100 per month or 
a little over a penny a minute. Since I have the connection
all the time, why NOT use it?

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

If the whole point of connecting is to get the data,
then you have already spent xxx cents or dollars or
whatever to get it. Since your needs and access 
capabilities are not mine, you should store it on
a floppy or something. My needs are different, and it
doesn't cost me the same that it costs you.

You ask:
> - deleted per copyright -

To that I will answer YES to bells, YES to whistles
and NO to pictures. I only have a 14.4K
modem connection. The downloading of pictures does
take a significant overhead and one that I am not always
willing to pay. Therefore, with Mosaic, I can delay image
loading and only chose to get pictures when I feel that
they are needed. I chose the level of load on my 
system - it isn't forced upon me.

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -


I concur. Now how shall we accomplish this? Further on you
mention your "library". What form will this library take?
Will it be a CD or a set of floppies? What method will 
accomplish this goal? I for one don't have an answer to that.

You state:
> - deleted per copyright -

Since HTML is actually ASCII characters that are imbeded in
text, I have found that indexing straight HTML documents and 
then throwing away known tags to be just as efficient as 
Plain Vanilla ASCII. That is why WAIS has been so efficiently
incorporated into the Web infrastructure. I don't see 
a signifcant difference in accessing Plain Vanilla ASCII
and HTML coded ASCII.

You ask:
> - deleted per copyright -

I ask you, why do you think that bells and whistles will
deprive the masses of literacy? My experience has been
that GUI based computers have given more people access
to the resources of the Internet than all command line
tools to date. What is being taken away from these masses?

You ask:
> - deleted per copyright -

When I was at Sun, I routinely received over 200 messages
per day. Most of them were information that I stored 
for future need. They weren't things that I needed to
respond to.

When I receive commercial messages that are junk mail
quality, I can screen them out by refusing "junk" quality
mail. If the mail is not sent with the "junk" classification
on it, I can appeal to the site's system admin or the
network provider for the offender. Canter & Seigal
caused a large ruckass. I don't expect them to be the
last, but I do expect nettiquite to eventually prevail
even on this wild frontier.


I know that there are several other areas that other 
people have/will address. I will leave it to them.

Thanks for your time.

Mary Morris

Actually surprizingly enough, the line above does access the

If these articles hadn't come from Prof. Hart, I'd ignore them, but his
project is so interesting that I can't.  I'm also interested because I've
decided to focus on digital libraries and I'm involved in building one or
at least the infrastructure to create it.

Idea rejecting html like rejecting article & punctuation maybe even grammar
save bandwidth  Sure you can but why go backwards  New media call for new
grammar style punctuation cover pages etc like for gutenberg  (Just thought
I'd take us back in time to when things were more "efficient.")

Yeah, plain vanilla ASCII will transfer from computer to computer faster,
but will it transfer from human to human faster?  Access to information
doesn't equate to communication, much less to education.

Many assumptions in this article are disturbing, but I'm most bothered by
the either-or assumptions; that texts must be created either for network
distribution or for floppy distribution, but not both; either for 16 MB
machines or for 1 MB, but not both.  The reality is that companies such as
Passage Systems are making great progress on building end-to-end publishing
systems that accomodate multiple media.  I can understand choosing plain
ASCII as a base for Project Gutenberg; I can't understand its
glorification.

There seems to be an implication that the invention of the printing press
directly led to a spread of literacy.  That's a common fallacy.  There was
an explosion of books following the convergence of printing technology and
the Italian paper mills' production of cheap paper.  But those books didn't
reach the masses, which remain illiterate until the Industrial Revolution
directly created and spread wealth (or more cynically, created demand for
educated workers).  The arrival of books in early medieval Europe widened
the gap between the wealthy and the poor, just as computer and network
technologies are doing today.  We can certainly hope that today's progress
in technology will lead to some sort of new wealth that will pay for the
spread of literacy, but we shouldn't kid ourselves that access to
information will.

Although I spend a great deal of my time with a group that uses technology
for education in poor communities, I don't have any illusion that we're
making broad changes.  If everyone did the same, perhaps broad changes
would result, but I don't have any illusions about that happening, either.

Proposing that distribution of ASCII texts will change the literacy rate is
self-aggrandizing.  The obstacle for marginalized people isn't the
difference in cost between expensive, "inefficient" GUI systems and
inexpensive, "efficient" ASCII systems; it's that there's any cost at all.
Even if the computers were free, with Shakespeare, etc., computers still
don't teach.

Hmm.  This sounds familiar.  I did not realize that Pogo said it in the

Well it should - it's a universal unique article ID, generated by the
posting system when the article is submitted, or in this case by the
mailing-list to news gateway.  Theoretically this id can be any random
string, but then there is always the chance of two systems generating
the same article ID.  Hence IDs usually have the site-name
(VMD.CSO.UIUC.EDU) a time stamp (940625) and a random # component.

If your newsreader (be it Mosaic or trn) doesn't recognize the
article, then it is because netnews is a flood protocol and the
article hasn't reached your site - or your site doesn't carry the
newsgroup in question, in which case you won't see the article at all.

Subject: HTML+ and automated forms
content-length: 2527

(Chris Lilley, whom I quite wrongly flamed here a couple of weeks ago,
graciously accepted my private apology. I was wrong. - Thank you Chris.)

HTML + and automated documents.

Comments are due to Dave Raggett re HTML+ proposal by 23rd June.  I want to
flag these thoughts to this group.

Forms:

At the moment field inputs to forms is very limited.  The browsers don't
handle them very well - <return> does not move from field to field
terminating each input and moving the cursor to the next field.  Neither
Lynx or Mosaic seems very form-friendly yet.  I am not sure to what extent
this is due to the HTML specification but I think it is not very much.

I see HTML (++ perhaps) as being an ideal standard for the automation of
forms.  The concept of lookup tables for field inputs, code and description
is a simple structure and would need no further definition beyond a
"lookup" parameter in the field definition, any more would require a file
structure definition and may become very complicated.  This "lookup"
facility would provide the potential for data validation and verification
without recourse to the server but would lead to deeper more massive forms.
The HTML+ specification provides for notification to the server when a
field is updated but this would be slower and more cumbersome than
including, in HTML (++ ?), facilities for the automation of documents.

Electronic indexing, with dynamic display of results, is a useful addition
and gives a hint to the future shape of documents in webspace.  They look a
lot like large reference works - many k!  An automated form miight occupy
quite a large space - 100k for 20 -30 inputs but I think I would like to
see this sort of thing handled by a future version of HTML.  

Perhaps, in my ignorance I am moving into an entirely different
specification and if I am please point me at it.  I have not found a
standard for automated forms yet but believe this is might be crucial to
HTML.  Would it, for example, be possible to build forms to produce
hypertext documents with lookup tables for tags?  Might forms like this
produce also others like themselves on the web?

I will plough on with this because I believe there is demand for some
greater automation - loops, array support, etc.  This might lead to very
complex forms but might (would it?) provide a very useful and versatile
tool for webmasters, document authors, feedback, registration.

Automated forms?  Anyone?

My understanding is that there is a little more context here.  Project 
Gutenberg is also under attack from archivists and scholars who argue that 
plain ascii is inherently incapable of conveying the complete content of a 
text.  The is the point of, for example, the Text Encoding Initiative, yet 
another SGML DTD for the storage and dissemination of "important" texts.

Dr. Hart,

I am the Information Server Administrator at NCSA and as such have configured 
and maintained the NCSA WWW server since it's inception.  I would request
that you correct the following information that you have published in
`The Superhighway Steamroller'

1) NCSA has never used any of it's SuperComputers as any sort of information 
   server.  This simply was not necessary.  We are currently using 
   Round-Robin DNS to rotate through four Hewlett-Packard 735's on an FDDI ring.
   This is necessary because we are handling in excess of 1.7 million 
   connections per week.  I will not attempt to justify our allocation of 
   resources at this time but it is important that you correct the fact that we 
   have not dedicated a Cray for this purpose.

2) NCSA does still maintain a 3 shift Operations Staff which provides 24 hour/
   7 day a week coverage on all of the supercomputers, our HTTP server, and our
   gopher server.  I am in the process of upgrading our FTP server and 
   will be including it in the 24/7 coverage.

I would be very happy to answer any questions you may have regarding 
Information Servers at NCSA prior to future publications.

I trust you will disseminate these corrections as widely as the original
article.  I am respecting your explicit copyright in not distributing the
corrections myself.

Perhaps from your news feed.  Mine does not have this article.  News
articles are organized by group, but stored by message_id (which is what
the above is - GUTNBERG is part of the message_id syntax, not a group).
If one's news feed has the article, the above works fine (until the article
falls off the nntpd FIFO).

Since Mr. Spero's posting to www, I obviously do not need the article,
however I was also trying to make a point about URI syntax.  I occasionally
argue that hostnames should be permitted, which currently they are not.

Subject: Re: Pointer: The Superhighway Steamroller

First of I think Miachel Harts position on copyright is, well shall we say
rather obsurd, allthough other words come to mind..........

I think that one can have this debate about cost-effectiveness many ways,
if one looks at the cost of creating the perfect ASCI text and then just
adding basic markup, the markup portion time is nill compared to the
process of getting the real ASCII 100% correct.  So I believe the cost
effectiveness argument is kind of lame.. 

But the much larger point is the not directly measurable value ofthe
converted text.  The ASCI text files as produced by Gutenberg are
basically useless for any type of reasonable distribution.  I like to
refer to them as the raw byte stream with the content hidden but none
desipherable without the key - the real document side by side.

There is a reason why we have a well established publishing record, which
dates way back to the Monks.  A document becomes intelligent and readable
and a master in conveyng information( and I will argue Knowledge) when it
is not only containing propper text, but also a form of lay-out
(presentation) which crabs ones attention. 

I would argue that reading Alice in Woderland as put in ASCI by the
Gutenberg project, versus layed out propper with mark-up (HTML SGML, PS
formatting whatever)  conveys a much more powerfull message.

So as to how does one measure cost effectiveness?? I think that the
longterm societal benifits of propper layed out and formatted and
presented text well out weigh the extra cost required to put in minimum
markup.

At the same time I would argue allthough WWW is a good start we have still
much work to do in this area.  As I for example publish kids poems, I like
to control for every one the exact laye out because I believe that the way
the child layed out the words, surrounding maybe a drawing conveyes in
itself a powerfull message and should be able to be published as that to
the net.  

However I think that Mr Harts efforts, allthough maybe nobel, may have
been surpassed by better technology as well as the requirement to think
about text more as a message stream. It is time that he and other realize
that there is much more then just passing on a stream of characters without
a sensible ordering and presentation.  I hope not to see the day when the
Library world has converted all its material to Mr Harts standards, god
help us in doing research.........

As to the technical aspects in his orginal posting, lets just say they are
plain wrong and as such I won't even discuss them.

P.S: Should I copyright this note? and how do I cite mr Harts paragraph
for every one if I can not cut and paste..... Actually I will argue that
his copyright will not hold up in court, but that is for another day.

Evidently, you haven't heard "Professor" Hart in action.  Two years ago 
he spoke to a gathering of librarians and library and information science 
grad students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  Before I heard 
him speak I thought the Gutenberg Project was interesting, afterwards I 
realized that it has serious flaws.

Hart's uses a pool of volunteers who either keys in or scans texts from 
literary sources which are no longer under copyright.  Minimal effort 
seems to be made to guarantee the accuracy of the texts.  Of course, any 
effort to assure that the electronic text matches the printed text relies 
upon the original text to be accurate.  Many textual scholars can point 
out that texts which have been printed are not always accurate.

Two years ago Hart argued that rekeying was more efficient that OCR; I 
wouldn't necessarily argue that but I do wonder why anyone thinks a 
reasonable human would prefer to read a novel on a VT100 monitor rather 
than out of a 75 cent paperback from a used book store or a hardcover 
volume from the local library.

I can't speak for the academic library community, but I haven't ever spoken 
to a colleague who seems to have a high opinion of Mr. Hart and his 
project.  It's inconsequential as far as I'm concerned.  IMHO, his 
ravings are best left ignored.  If www-talk is fortunate, Hart won't 
subscribed to this group.  Every listserv I'm on which he monitors seems 
to be inundated which his periodic posting on new releases to the 
Gutenberg project.  When you see the same posting on every listserv you 
get into the habit of deleting everything which comes from Hart's email 
address without looking at it -- which is exactly what I do.

As I recall from another list, Hart started to add a copyright statement 
to his postings after others started to rebut what he said by quoting 
some of his statements. I believe Hart claimed he was being quoted out of 
context. 

Note that while Hart's email address ends in uiuc.edu, he has no 
affiliation with the University of Illinois.  Two years ago, his business 
card -- which I probably still have somewhere -- listed "systems analyst" 
as his occupation.  :-)

Hart seems obsessed with being able to say that he will have 
given away a trillion texts for free by 2001. IMHO, it seems that Hart is 
driven by his own egoistic pursuits.

I realize that I have open myself up for flaming from Mr. Hart, 
but he seems to enjoy such provocations. Since librarians have been 
putting up with him for years on the network, thought I would let the 
rest of you know his "reputation."

Demonstrably untrue. For starters FTP requires two TCPIP connections, the
control information is slightly higher for HTTP but FTP cannot handle
compression transparently as HTTP can.

FTP is probably the most braindead protocol ever. The ASCII assumption
causes masses of lost bandwidth every single day because by default FTP
clients transfer in ASCII mode. this means that binariy files are frequently
transfered twice. When both client and server speak ASCII this is more
than a little stupid.

Moguls are planning to end the assumption that everyone will communicate in

Quite true.

Untrue. I use it on my Toshiba portable which has no modem and no ethernet.

Nope. HTTP 1.0 would require this if implemented in a daft manner. There is
no standard for HTTP over dialup at the moment. But the assumption would be
that you would connect to a proxy server and use a persistent connection.


Hart misses out on the key idea of the Web which is not HTML nor HTTP. The
idea behind the Web is a name that can identify a unique information object
and how to access it. HTML and HTTP are just the icing on the cake.

Note that Prof Hart gives us no solution to the problem of sending the
complete works of shakespere from A to b. The Web does. If you only want
to refer to one verse of hamlet :-

http://shakespere..bogus.rsc.com/plays/hamlet/act2/scene4#verse23

Try that with plaintext.

I have received several comments about my rebuttal

Also, am I violating the copyright by posting the

The copyright says:

READ BY THE PEOPLE TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED. RECIPIENTS OF
THIS MESSAGE MAY NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE IT IN WHOLE OR IN

I read this to mean that since it didn't originally go

full netnews up and running yet or I would have posted
the rebuttal to the original news group. If you know how
to post by mail I would appreciate that information.

I can understand copyrighting work, but I think that
this copyright went too far. Posting it to a newsgroup
makes it available for an audience of close to 10 million
or about half of the Internet community. Knowing who does
or doesn't have the ability to be a "recipient" is a 
horribly gray area here.

I have written him to ask for permission to include
his text in my rebuttal.

Thanks.

I've "heard" him on the net for a long time, particularly in his posts on
Interpedia.  Discussion there seemed to die when it changed from a listserv
to a newsgroup, so I guess I haven't had a good dose of Hart-isms for a
while.

Of late, I've become much more interested in this because we're looking at
employing refugees, students and others to do much the same for the
Sarajevo library project.  So I'm paying a bit more attention, but a little
voice has told me not to solicit advice from P.G.

Of course.  It makes limited sense when your country is at war and books,
when journals etc. are too heavy to airlift in.

I was a journalist for 15 years, so that particular flame doesn't bother me
a bit.  All quotes are out of context.

My intutitive decision not to seek his advice appears to correct... ;-)

Yet again, please help.  I am putting together an "order form" through

and submit.  Currently my form uses the checkbox, i.e.:

	<INPUT TYPE="checkbox">Some order item here

How does the "checked" item info get passed to the form to be included in the

and TEXTAREA fields, but contains nothing from the selected CHECKBOX options.

Pardon my ignorance.  I look forward to any responses.  Please send them

We're looking for a way that a form can ask for the user to supply a
'file', with full MIME typing associated with that file, e.g., the
form element would want to specify 'Accept:' headers. 

For example, if this were a fax service, it could Accept: text/*,
application/postscript, image/* (but not, say, audio/*); if it were a
answering-machine application, it might accept only audio/*.

The client would do the appropriate thing for the client application,
e.g., prompt for a file name of the appropriate type, or, if audio was
being accepted, allow for recording of an audio clip...

The question is, what's the `right way' to handle this between HTML
and HTTP? Does this require a separate protocol? Should the `Accept:'
headers be part of the form?

Personally, I like putting them in the form if only so that you could
mail someone a form rather than always deliver it to them via http...

This is a browser characteristic and has nothing to do with HTML.
There is an XResource you can set to enable tabbing from field to field,
but I have lost it's name (damn spring cleaning).  Anyone care to 
enlighten us?

And more massive browsers.  Adding more complexity to the clients
is not really necessary - getting them to do forms at all is 
hard enough.

??? Are you thinking of something like the Borland wossname for MS-Windows?
The forms generator/event-driven programming thingy with the event
trees and simple IF/THEN rules etc? 
I don't think HTML needs to grow _that_ complex. Object-something?
Bundled with Crystal Reports?

> Automated forms?  Anyone?

Better to build forms that interface to server automation.
Making the client responsible for maintaining all the lookup tables
(the whole ISBN catalog?) isn't a win.

Good idea.  Wear a helmet too, just in case.  You never know when the

Um, I didn't say that.  The person who wrote "I think he left..." was
replying to an article in which I pointed to Professor Hart's message.

I hate to be pedantic, but I'm trying to talk PG into running an http
server (and/or taking over my index page), and I'd hate to have Dr. Hart
pissed off over something I didn't say.

Ah... I hated the <INPUT TYPE=FILE> proposal, but I've been noodling
on your application, and now that you phrase the question this way, a
lightbulb just went off and I can see how I think it could work...

Let me preface this by saying that I still haven't made a complete
study of WWW forms -- for the HTML 2.0 spec, we did a cut-and-paste
job from the HTML+ spec and we consulted the NCSA doc a little. Since
then, several people have told me it's wrong, but nobody's provided a
replacement spec.

Anyway, that said..

I wonder if you could use the ENCTYPE attribute of the FORM element
to express what you're interested in...

My current revision of the html.dtd,
        $Id: html.dtd,v 1.16 1994/06/13 20:55:50 connolly Exp $
includes the following:

<!ATTLIST FORM
        ACTION %URI #REQUIRED
        METHOD (%HTTP-Method) #IMPLIED
        ENCTYPE %Content-Type; #IMPLIED
        >

So it is possible to express the content-type of the submitted
information. From the NCSA doc, I see:

From: http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html :
	ENCTYPE specifies the encoding for the fill-out form
	contents. This attribute only applies
	if METHOD is set to POST -- and even then, there is only one
	possible value (the default,
	application/x-www-form-urlencoded) so far.

While this doesn't really give you the full expressive power of
a set of Accept: headers, you could:

	1. Restrict your applications to one content type,
	possibly using the "text/*" convention.

	2. Hack and wedge more stuff in the ENCTYPE attribute

	3. Propose a new attribute or a subelement of FORM that
	gives the full expressive power of Accept:

	4. Punt the idea of sticking the Accept: info in the
	document, and have your client use a HEAD request
	to find out what forms of data are acceptible. This has bad
	performance implications for clients that want to change
	the user interface based on the acceptable content types.

>Personally, I like putting them in the form if only so that you could
>mail someone a form rather than always deliver it to them via http...

This proposal is happy in that respect.

>For example, if this were a fax service, it could Accept: text/*,
>application/postscript, image/* (but not, say, audio/*); if it were a
>answering-machine application, it might accept only audio/*.

To express these examples (using choice 2 above), you might use:

	<FORM ACTION="http://faxserverhost/faxinput" METHOD="POST"
		ENCTYPE="text/*, application/postscript, image/*">
	Please submit your fax data.
	<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
	</FORM>

	<FORM ACTION="http://ansmachhost/audioinput" METHOD="POST"
		ENCTYPE="audio/*">
	Please submit your message.
	<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
	</FORM>

The client would, of course, have to recognize the ENCTYPE="..."
and modify the user interface accordingly.

Have you checked out the Forms tutorial found at
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html

The checkbox example there evidently also uses a VALUE={text_string}
If the checkbox comes back checked VALUE is set to that string. If
the box isn't checked the VALUE field  comes back NULL. At least
that is how I read the tutorial. I haven't tried this myself yet.

The filename in the bad requests always ends in the exact same
binary garbage, only the initial part changes.

Does anyone know which browser sends such requests?  I think it
may be one of the Macintosh browsers, since some of the hostnames
contain "mac".  We're still running NCSA httpd 1.1 for most of
our offerings, so I haven't been able to snag the User-Agent

You do seem to rather miss the point.  Project Gutenberg arranges the
production and distribution of electronic texts to real people as well
as to academics and librarians :-).  I really don't care, when I read
books, if a semicolon or a comma were misused, or if two paragraphs
are accidently merged into one.  I don't even care if a couple of
irrelevant words are missed out --- it's the *message* I'm after.

Sure, the current Project Gutenberg texts are never going to do
wonders for academics.  But they made my life a hell of a lot easier
when I did English 105, when I was studying short stories, when I
needed quote the bible to someone.

There is nothing stopping anyone from producing ``definitive'' works
from Project Gutenberg texts.  The bulk of the entry and formatting
has already been done for you.  You can even *sell* the results, and
so long as you don't call it a Project Gutenberg text, nobody cares.

> IMHO, it seems that Hart is driven by his own egoistic pursuits.

Speaking as someone who spent an entertaining day or two in Michael's
company, the last thing he is driven by is his ego.

Yup.  No disagreement there.  That's why Project Gutenberg doesn't say
``you can't mark up or add value to this text''.  However, you also
need a graphical terminal to read PostScript, and a specific set of
programs to read an HTML/SGML text.  You need nothing but your local
equivalent of more(1) to read plain ASCII.  Lowest common denominator.

A bold claim, but you don't back it up.  I FTPed and line printed one
of Shakespeare's plays and annotated the print-out in preparation for
an English essay.  Perfectly useable to me, and it saved me $9 as well
as giving something *sizeable* to annotate.

Note that I'm not saying raw ASCII is the only way.  There are scripts
for FTP on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, written by me, that convert some PG
texts to motorised books in HTML.  I also don't agree with Michael
that WWW is a wasteful or negative technology.  I wrote the original
FAQ, remember! :)  I'm just saying that ASCII has its place.

``Only the stupid person won't learn from another's mistakes'' :-)

You might not agree with the goals or mechanisms of Project Gutenberg,
but at the very basic level PG has a lot of experience in the scanning
and OCR field.  I'd look closely at PG before you start your own
project --- there are a lot of important lessons about the quality and
control of volunteer labour to be learned.

I of course went to the CIU W3 Catalog, did a search on 'copyright',
and came up with 

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/Copyright-FAQ/top.html

The Copyright Basics therein give an ample discussion of `fair use'
and left me believing that quoting Hart's work without permission
might be marginal ethically, although I doubt that the contemplated
quoting of it in a discussion forum would be actionable legally.

I am trying to test a script that parses through the output of a submitted

<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="file://localhost/home/test/script">

When I complete the form and hit the submit button, the contents of the

There is no absolute copyright in the sense Hart is claiming. The relevant
acts specificaly permit `fair use'. In the context of the internet annotation
of selected potions (not the whole work!) would almost certainly be considered
fair use, especially when posted to ten million people. You can't use the
copyright laws to prevent reviews

DAMNIT. Everybody keeps on saying that HTML requires more bandwidth than
ASCII and they are WRONG! You keep on assuming that the documents are going
to be passed as plain ascii. In any intelligent system they won't be. (I
am not claiming that the software out there has a high IQ, but I would claim
that a year from now it will.) Now use a reasonably intelligent compression
program and tell it that HTML is comming through, and on average you're
going to get a file that that is almost exactly the same size. There is
absolutely no reason why "</em>" would take more bits to encode than "*".

There, now I feel much better.

I suppose I will speak in the minority when I state that I thought Mr. Hart's
articles were extremelly well written and thought provoking, although marred
by inaccuracies, poor comparisons and a lack of serious solutions.

Here is my response to his articles:

Subject: Re: The Superhighway Steamroller
Keywords: 

Michael Hart starts off his series of articles by railing against what I would
call "wasted bits". He points out that the internet community, as it exists
today and as it is likely to exist in the future, is doing some enourmously
un-economical things. He then goes on to suggest that keeping books on floppies
in ascii form is far more economically efficient than downloading an HTMLized
document with pictures from a webserver, a comparison for which he has received
much flamage elsewhere. These are intelligent, although extreme, comments.

I am therefore quite puzzled by his latter comments condeming metered internet
usage. The reason why there is such ENOURMOUS inefficiency in the way that
the net is used, the reason why FTP transfers are occuring at a fraction of the
rate they once did, is that for each individual user the bits are free. There
is absolutely no incentive for anybody to decrease their bandwidth usage.
SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR THE INTERNET. NSF and commercial internet providers,
can hide the costs from the users, but the resources available on the net are
finite. If the marginal cost is zero, demand is going to approach infinity.

I think Mr. Hart has made some excellent points, but ruled out the best
solution. I am not saying that everybody should have to shell out large
amounts of money on a per minute basis to use the internet. Surely the
hundreds of dollars of value that advertisers see in our attention spans
can be extracted by the internet and used to pay for the costs of basic
access.

What I am saying is that it is absurd to give people a finite resource,
like internet bandwidth, at zero marginal cost. If we remedied this
problem, either wasted bits would disappear, or their originators'
pocketbooks would become considerably lighter.

I speak as a programmer/part time law student who has just finished the
Intellectual Property modules of my course.

This is a *big* complicated area.  A number of Council of Europe
directives, some still merely proposals, will change the face of copyright
in this part of the world and, as reciprocity is specified for third
countries, perhaps beyond as well.

Copyright.  Is a group of rights mostly moral and economic.  In England,
for example, the moral rights attaching to a work require that the author
of the piece be acknowledged as the author in any quotation.  In France,
for example, the moral right can extend to forbidding the use of a piece or
an extract in any context the author disagrees with.  The economic right in
France allows, for example, the breeder of a horse to claim a "cut" from
the sale of his horse's foals - even after the original horse has been
sold.  This would not be allowed under English contract law.

So, the directives.

93/C 308/01, The proposed Database Directive, creates a "right to prevent
the unfair extraction from a database".  The new right is independent of
copyright and is *not* subject to *any* of the tests for copyright.  No
"sweat of the brow" etc.  Database is defined as "a collection of data,
works or other materials stored and accessed by electronic means".  *All*
the contents of every computer will one day be covered by the Database
Directive.  Why?  There are no tests for eligibility, there is a
cast iron right to prevent "unfair extraction" (read fair and unfair
dealing) and the only exception I can think of to the definition is vinyl
recordings which are primarily a mechanical and not an electronic process
- the first phonographs were clockwork.

So - fair dealing?  I am reminded of an English case (copyright is
different everywhere despite Berne) where the entire contents of a
government memo was printed in a national newspaper.  The government sought
to use copyright to protect themselves and sued.  The result was that "fair
dealing" could, in certain circumstances, extend as far as full
reproduction in another form or media provided that the intention is to
enlighten, inform, criticise the *subject matter* of the disputed text.

The key word here is "intention" and because of this Prof. Hart's copyright
notice is extremely arrogant and flimsy *but* if you feel unsure about what
you are doing then you may be in danger.  I am 100% sure, however, that a
free and fair discussion of the issues, with large and small extracts is
totally llegitimate.

If this carries on much longer I might end up reading the article and I
really don't think I'm very interested.  As I said privately when this
started, I remember when videotext was the cheapest method of data storage
and dissemination.  Yeuch.

If floppies are good, perhaps punched cards are better ?  I *always* found
what I was looking for on my punched cards cause they had the alpha tags

I can think of one fine use of a large body of texts on line: historical
linguistics.  The study of language change used to be done by some 
scholar poring over centuries of texts armed with a pencil and a stack
of index cards.  You would note down every instance you found of some
interesting language feature, and note every instance where you would expect
it to appear and it did not.  Correlate all of the cards
with time, place and historical events and look for trends.  This took
*forever* to do.

For an on line collection of texts to help it needs to 
	a) Span a long period of time
	b) be ruthlessly accurate (preserve all the apparent typos and
		oddnesses)
	c) contain some pretty mundane stuff: diary entries, love letters,
		shopping lists... whatever.

So: probably no help for linguists here, either.

Irregardless of the issue of whether someone can really copyright 
Internet distributed text, quoting the article, even extensively "for the 
purpose of critical review" is in fact fair use under copyright law.  As 
with all such juris, the key element is the idea of intent: if the intent 
is to review and rebut, rather than redistribute, it is in the spirit of 
critical review.

amen. And I couldn't have thought of a more interesting text than Alice 
in Wonderland to apply hypertext links to. Alice goes down the rabbit 
hole; rather like moving through a hyperlink... Alice grows small (the 
Jefferson Airplane come over the airwaves (Oh, I know it's off in the 
future, but what the hey).

Now, does anyone out there know of someone with copious amounts of spare 
time that wants to wade through the looking-glass?

I've kept an eye out for a long time for something along those lines, so
I'm fairly sure that there isn't one.  I've resisted the temptation to
create one; instead I'm using AppleEvents to tell MacWeb to go get
documents for me, so that I can use HyperCard-based tools to build
directories and such.

If you find anything, I'd like to hear about it.

The Voyager Co. published Martin Gardner's "The Annotated Alice" a few
years ago, using their HyperCard publishing engine.

Does anyone know what href stands for? I would assume that
it means hypertext reference, but I have looked through every 
tutorial that I could find and I can't find a single place
that states what it means.

     Hi Everyone...
     
     Could anyone share their experience in using mosaic via asynchronous 
     lines like modem from home who don't have direct Internet access?  I 
     know there are lot of solutions available like Chameleon, pc/Xware 
     etc., and not sure which one works the best.  If anyone  has set up 
     connections like this and would like to share their experience, it 
     would be very much appreciated.

     I have been trying to use Mosaic-L10N(2.4.0) to check its 
     functionality for different character sets.  Does anyone know if there 
     are programs which can convert English documents to French, German

        ...but I do wonder why anyone thinks a reasonable human would 
        prefer to read a novel on a VT100 monitor rather than out of a 75 cent 
        paperback from a used book store or a hardcover volume from the local 
        library.

Yes, I *would* prefer to read a used paperback or a nice hardcover from the 
library, but I live in Taiwan.  The selection of books available in English is 
zip. There are no used English book stores, and the library, for some strange 
reason, has nothing but books in Chinese.  I just finished _The prisoner of 
Zenda_ ala P.G.  There is no way I could have read it here in a book, other 
than by ordering it from overseas.  I'll be frank -- if I could have found a 
nice HTML formated version I would have read it instead. 

But I couldn't.

Rather than ranting about how worthless P.G. stuff is (or how yucky a VT100 
terminal is), get off the damn pot and produce something to compete with it. 
I do *not* mean another fancy protocol, browser, or  theoretical argument.  I 
mean some actual, readable, accessible, worth-the-effort-ot-downloading-them 
novels, plays, short stories, essays,...what have you. 

P.G. may be crude, it may be all of the things it is called on this list, but
it produces books.


BTW, I've tried rolling steam, but it always unrolls.  Does anybody know how 
to prevent this?

I agree with your design goals for a simple markup format, and the need
to keep HTML simple. I don't agree that HTML+ is complicated - in fact I
went to great pains to keep it simple. The DTD may be complicated, but
that is largely due to the way I modularised it.

IMHO the HTML+ table format is one of the simplest around, and as evidence
of that, it has been adopted by other SGML working groups such as TEI. The
switch to <P> as a container is in line with other SGML formats and makes
it practical to set paragraph alignment. It also simplifies implementations.

People do want richer control of how their documents appear, but rather than
complicate HTML, our plan is to introduce linked style sheets. HTML+ allows
authors to include an SGML ID attribute with all elements. This is used by
style sheets to name individual elements, so you can specify rendering
behaviour by tag name e.g. all H1 headers, and over-ride this class behaviour
for a specific header.

I fully agree with the goal of reducing the cost of entry for people who
which to experiment with new browsers etc. To this end we want to make
browsers into a set of cooperating applets, tied together by a messaging
scheme. The OpenDoc architecture will probably have something to offer
us here.

As well as ListProcessor requests that you will find below, you are able to
ask the following requests:

send <URL>
www <URL>
----------
this will send you back the document you requested, with all
its hrefs, so that you may ask further requests.
(if the document is too large, you will get only its first 5 000 lines).
The url sent may contain the following characters:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789:/._-+@%*()?

rsend <return-path> <URL>
-------------------------
Same as "send", but you can specify a different return-path

deep <URL>
----------
same as "send", but it will also send you the documents refered to
in the URL you mentioned.
(If the documents are too large, you will get only the first 5 000 lines
of what "deep" should provide)

source <URL>
------------
Same as "send", but allows you to see the source of the document, so that you may use a nicer HTML browser
to read it

rsource <return-path> <URL>
---------------------------
Same as "source", but you can specify a different return-path






			  ListProcessor 6.0

Here is a brief description of some of the requests recognized by ListProcessor.
Everything appearing in [] below is optional; everything
appearing in <> is mandatory; all arguments are case insensitive. The vertical
bar ("|") is used as a logical OR operator between the arguments. Requests may
be abbreviated, but you must specify at least the first three characters.

Keep in mind that when referring to a <list>, that list may be of two kinds:
local or remote, unless otherwise noted. When referring to a local list, your
request will be immediately processed; when referring to a remote list (a list
served by another ListProcessor which this system knows about), your request
will be appropriately forwarded. Issue a 'lists' request to get a listing of all
local and known remote lists to this ListProcessor.

Recognized requests are:


help [topic]
------------
Without arguments, this file. Otherwise get specific information on the
selected topic. Topics may also refer to requests. To learn more about this
system issue a 'help listproc' request. To get a listing of all available
topics, generate an error message by sending a bogus request like 'help me'.


set <list> [<option> <arg[s]>]
------------------------------
Without the optional arguments, get a list of all current settings for
the specified list. Otherwise change the option to a new value for that
list. Issue a 'help set' request for more information.


subscribe <list> <your name>
----------------------------
The only way to subscribe to a list. 


unsubscribe <list>
signoff <list>
------------------
Two ways of removing yourself from the specified list.

Note: The ultimate way to unsubscribe seems to be to send a mail
with the body
SIGNOFF WWW-ANNOUNCE
(to get out of www-announce), and no signature file attached.

recipients <list>
review <list>
-----------------
Get a listing of all non-concealed people subscribed to the specified list.


information <list>
------------------
Get information about the specified list.


lists
-----
Get a list of all local mailing lists that are served by this server, as well
as of all known remote lists.


index [archive | path-to-archive] [/password] [-all]
----------------------------------------------------
Get a list of files in the selected archive, or the master archive if no
archive was specified. If an archive is private, you have to provide its
password as well.


get <archive | path-to-archive> <file> [/password] [parts]
----------------------------------------------------------
Get the requested file from the specified archive. Files are usually split in
parts locally, and in such a case you will receive the file in multiple email
messages -- an 'index' request tells you how many parts the file has been split
into, and their sizes; if you need to obtain certain parts, specify them as
optional arguments. If an archive is private, you have to provide its password
as well.

view <archive | path-to-archive>] [/password] [parts]
-----------------------------------------------------
Same as "get" but in interactive mode justs catenates the file on the
screen.

search <archive | path-to-archive>] [/password] [-all] <pattern>
----------------------------------------------------------------
Search all files of the specified archive (and all of its subarchives if -all
is specified) for lines that match the pattern. The pattern can be an
egrep(1)-style regular expression with support for the following additional
operators: '~' (negation), '|' and '&' (logical OR and AND), '<' '>' (group
regular expressions). The pattern may be enclosed in single or double quotes.
Note: . matches any character including new line.

release
-------
Get information about the current release of this ListProcessor system.


which
-----
Get a listing of local mailing lists to which you have subscribed.


Cheers,

Arthur

Copies to www-talk and www-html.

Sorry to be a bore but this is important and a lot simpler than some people
seem to think.

Adding a lookup attribute to fields requires, in my earlier example, simply
a word "lookup" and a numeric value n.  The "lookup" tells the browser that
there is a reference file against which to verify any input.  The numeric
value tells the browser to search the file attached to the field when n
characters have been entered in the input field.  If a hit is scored then
the resulting record is pulled out of the file and put into the input
field.

I think that's about ten or twelve lines of code depending upon the
structure of the form the browser recieves, e.g: how the reference file or
files are attached to the form.  If they are refenced in the <input ...>
then they can be delivered to the browser as part of the package.  All the
browser has to do is open the relevant file when focus hits the field and
do a dynamic read when 4 or 5 characters have been entered, if there isn't
a hit then the field could be blanked and the user told why - no hit.

Seems pretty simple for the browser, simple for the server but
gives people like me a powerful tool with which to buuild "clever" forms.

Do I need to write a bit of pseudocode or code for this for anyone?

port is 16550 UART possessed is good -- other than the chipset, 16550 UART
serial 

ports most always have DB25 pin connectors as opposed to DB9 connectors.  This
will 

allow your 14.4 v.32bis and v.42bis modem to connect up to the Internet Service 

Provider at 57600 bps -- provided that your Internet Service Provider has a
similar 

modem on their end.

I think Malcolm Vincent's request is very pertinent, pity I don't know if
it is possible. A couple of times I've thought I've seen transparent gifs
but each time the originator has just used the default Mosaic background 
(I've now changed my background so I can see the cheating!). Do we really 
have to resort to xbm's which are, unfortunately, rather large?

You can use the NetPBM utilities (a new and improved version of the
PBM+ utilities) to create GIFs with transparent colors.

You say this:

ppmtogif file.ppm -transparent rgb:f/f/f > file.gif

to produce file.gif with white marked as a transparent color.  Then
modern GIF viewers, including X Mosaic, will show the background color
instead of white.  See the manual page for more details.

I don't know the canonical place to get NetPBM; try archie.

Hi guys - 


 I haven't had time to write this up properly, as I've been
working getting the BGI based server working properly with Slow HTTP :-); 
there's been some interest shown, so I figured I'd post a sketch description,
plus the working draft of the ASN.1. 

It probably won't make much sense to anybody yet, but it should become
clearer over time.


Fast HTTP
---------

Service description:

 Fast HTTP (FHTTP) is an applications protocol for transfering
hypermedia objects.  It is based on the existing HTTP protocol, but
uses a different encoding for request and response messages, together
with a different transaction model. This protocol is designed for use
over high relative-latency networks, although certain features also
make it suitable for use over low bandwidth connections.

FHTTP operates over reliable connection oriented transports such as
TCP; modifications for use over unreliable connection-less transports
like UDP are possible, but are not addressed in this note.

Protocol operation:

All FHTTP transactions are asynchronous.

Once a transport level connection is established, the client sends an
initialise request; when a server recieves this request, it responds
with an initialise response. The server may send other requests before
recieving the response; however the server must return the initialise
response message before any other responses.

Once the initialisation stage has been completed, the client and
server exchange requests and responses. Each message is labeled with a
16 bit message identifier; client initiated messages should use even
numbered message ids; server initiated messages odd numbered ones.

The only request/response pair currently defined is 'GET'. A GET
request contains a list of one or more URIs to be retrieved. The
server can split a single object into multiple responses, each
containing part of the whole; this allows dynamically created
objects to be generated and transmitted on the fly. Responses for more
than one object can be interleaved.

In addition to  objects corresponding to those listed in the GET
request, the server may transmit a certain number of objects that
were not requested, corresponding to objects which it believes the
server is likely to request in the immediate future. The canonical
example for this is the retrieval of bitmapped graphics embedded in an
HTML page; however it can also be used when certain links on a page
are followed with very high probability. 

If a client recieves a GET response corresponding to an unsolicited
object, and determines that the object is indeed needed, it should
then transmit a request corresponding to that object (i.e. the
response is transmitted before the request). If the object is
definitely un-needed, the client should issue a cancel request.

Please make an effort to keep up with the FAQ, everyone.  This thread has 
been done to death on comp.infosystem.www.* and has been reflected in the 
FAQ for some time.

-- Begin excerpt --
4.9: How can I make transparent GIFs?

   Transparent GIFs are useful because they appear to blend in smoothly
   with the user's display, even if the user has set a background color
   that differs from that the developer expected.
   
   There is a document explaining transparent GIFs available at the URL
   http://melmac.harris-atd.com/transparent_images.html. You can fetch
   the program giftrans by anonymous ftp from ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de at
   the path /pub/net/www/tools/giftrans.c.

I think that there are at least three important issues when we talk about
complexity:

(1) Level of complexity for a person to write an HTML document by hand, that
    is, without using an HTML editor or some conversion tool.  Call this
    "user complexity."

(2) Level of complexity for a person to write a tool that parses, formats,
    interprets, etc. HTML.  Call this "developer complexity."

(3) Level of complexity for a person to extend the capabilities or domain of
    HTML.  Call this "future complexity."

I think HTML+ succeeds very well in eliminating user complexity.  This is
probably what you meant when you said:

> IMHO the HTML+ table format is one of the simplest around, and as evidence
> of that, it has been adopted by other SGML working groups such as TEI.

The table *is* simple to use.

HTML+ (with the exception of equations) also fairs well for developer
complexity.  Simply by making sure that a correct DTD exists helps
tremendously (not all HTML hackers will believe this, but it's true.)  Your
comment below encourages me that you are trying to reduce developer
complexity:

> The switch to <P> as a container is in line with other SGML formats and makes
> it practical to set paragraph alignment. It also simplifies implementations.

I think that some other things might be explored to further reduce developer
complexity.  Things like making lists and tables with the same mechanism.
Viola already uses the same code for lists as tables --- I was surprised the
first time I saw a list with borders all around the items.  It simplifies
the code (Viola needs to work on the presentation though. :-)  In any case,
it's hard to tell the difference between a list and a table of one or two
columns!

The part of HTML+ that really breaks down in my mind is that it does nothing
to contain future complexity.  This problem is already starting to show up
with the different levels of implementation and the issues surrounding
equations.  I've heard things like "the equations won't satisfy the needs of
a chemist" with the implication that this must be "fixed" in HTML+.  This is
a pretty scary direction.  What about all of the different variations of
form INPUT that appear in HTML+?  I sure don't want SCRIBBLE fields or HTML
editor fields wired into the browser I use!  I just want to bind xpaint or
emacs or *something* to a MIME type and have the browser required to start
the application and associate it with the document.  Fields can be tagged
with a MIME type and the whole thing fits together.

> People do want richer control of how their documents appear, but rather than
> complicate HTML, our plan is to introduce linked style sheets.

I agree with this.  HTML should control document navigation and viewing
structure.  To clarify, navigation structure controls how a person can read a
document and viewing structure controls how a browser can render a document.

In my opinion, the relative position of document components (i.e. figures,
tables, paragraphs, etc.) is an important part of navigation structure.  I
don't like the fact that HTML+ seems to tie layout information to content
components.  For example:  I can have a boxed floating figure, but not a
boxed floating paragraph.

For a general solution to this problem, I just want some basic layout
capabilities added to HTML+.  Things like:

	BOX	a region with generic layout policy
	VBOX	a region with enforced vertical tiling
	HBOX	a region with enforced horizontal tiling
	P	a region with paragraph layout policy

Each of these exist to control the layout of the objects they contain.
Other people might want more.  The following structures are possible:

	o An IMG in a P defines a floating picture without text wrapped
	  around it (what we have today in HTML)

	o An IMG in a BOX in a P defines a floating picture with text
	  wrapped around it (same as a figure in HTML+)

	o An IMG and a P in an HBOX defines a paragraph with a hanging
	  picture (same as a table with two cells, one containing an IMG and
	  the other text, in HTML+)

	o An IMG and a P, each positioned at (0, 0) in the same BOX defines
	  a picture with a text overlay.

I think this is great.  It could go further.  Variables could be stored in
the "style sheet", aka database, and called out in the document.  Imagine a
simple little tag like LOOKUP which just grabs a value out of a style sheet
and includes it into the document.  The point being that the style sheet is
a really powerful tool that should be available for more than just font
selection.  It's easy on authors, easy on implementors and makes
experimentation easier to achieve (reduces future complexity.)

I think this is great too.  Will the messaging scheme be part of HTML?  or
will there be another standard that covers it?  How will that messaging
scheme be influenced from an HTML document?  MIME types?  by entity?  by ID?
Will browsers be required to implement it as part of HTML?

This thread is making me feel much more confident about the intent of HTML+
and current browser design, but not at all confident about where HTML+ is
going or how it will be affected by the commercial marketplace.

Thanks for giving us an HTML+ proposal worthy of arguing over.  :-)

Always nice to know.
But then, Simple != Easy.
In fact (as any AI person knows) Simple often == Bloody hard.

Well, where is the file stored?  Presumably it's out on the net somewhere
(sample place the form came from? Probably, but maybe not - maybe there's
a canonical list of ZIP codes somewhere.

If (as you assume below) the files are local - how do they appear?
I am not about to download a 10 MB database of widget descriptions just
to have a field lookup.

If I can assume that the form needs to do a net access - then
we can assume a form may need to do several such calls (if there
are several fields).

Therefore, (in order to speed things up - all those net accesses take time)
why not just let the server handle it - and report errors appropriately,
or even return another filled out form with the partially fields
filled out.  

For short lists, you can just as easily use the existing FORM features.
For long lists - you need to talk to the server again, and therefore
should delay that to SUBMIT time.

Ok - assuming you want to implement it, may I suggest:
	add a LOOKUP=urlstring
which will call the LOOKUP with the NAME=whatever typed so far if the user
presses a visual feature or somesuch (remember that net-lag is 
non-trivial and doing a new lookup after every new keystroke is not
feasible.

If you need clever forms, why not use a more suitable tool?

I think this is reasonable and so I will stop.  Given that the browsers
appear to wait whilst the form is SUBMIT-ed it seems most practicable to
allow the server side of the transaction to verify data before completing
the transaction.  This would allow the server to return forms that are
incorrectly completed to the browser.

It occurs to me that if the server is getting a submitted form from, say, a
VMS client in use by many processes, then returning the form correctly may
be slightly problematic.  In any event Christian's solution places the onus
on me to produce the code behind CGI and preserves the "simplicity" of
HTML+.  No criticism, but if I tried to teach some of my IP's the table
handling examples I've seen on this list they'd never speak to me again. 

There are 50 ways to leave your lover and more to put together an HTML doc.

@ Subject: Fast HTTP - a hyper-text transfer protocol for tommorows networks.
@ 
@  I haven't had time to write this up properly, as I've been
@ working getting the BGI based server working properly with Slow HTTP :-); 
@ there's been some interest shown, so I figured I'd post a sketch description,
@ plus the working draft of the ASN.1. 

Hi,

Bear with me on this one again. I have a few questions on this...

@ It probably won't make much sense to anybody yet, but it should become
@ clearer over time.

Having read all this I started thinking that it sounded good, but then I
realised that we are talking in an ASN.1 environment. So my question is
really;

>From the start HTTP was kept quite simple. To the extent that anyone
with a small bit of C/perl experience can write their own server. All
connections are done with 8bit chars, in a human readable way.
Okay so it isnt the fastest way, but it is more efficient to my eyes
than say FTP.

Why then should we change this and move over to ASN.1? I must confess
that having the ASN.1 specs on my desk, and trying to look something up
in them once, that I gave up and created a workaround (based on the code
in ISODE8.0 infact). The thing is that for something like "text/html" why
do we need ASN.1 headers? Or for GIF/JPEG for that matter. Okay in a
model like say X.500 when multiple attributes are being passed in one
go they make sense, but in a model such as this one, where the average
connection is to pass one page of text and say 2 images its a bit
extreme. Not to mention the text based browsers who just need one page
of text and are done with it. Look at the additional overhead there.

I for one can see more of an advantage of the model we have now, with
say mime mulitipart message bodies, if only because it is so simple, and
also makes testing of the server easy. (How many people can say they
havent telneted to a server and done a manual "HEAD / HTTP/1.0" in order
to test it or find out the servers version quickly... from the model you
are proposing we would need specialist tools to do that if I get it
right).

Looking at the tone of all that I guess it sounds very ANTI ASN.1, so
please dont get me wrong; Im not against ASN.1 in the right place. I
just think that it is very much overkill in this case. I would much
rather stay with a human readable protocol with full MIME extensions.

WWWer's:

Yesterday in a fit of trying to understand MIME types and stuff I defined
a few different types to give me an interface to MH.  It's a terrible
kludge.  Has anyone done something similar that I can steal ideas from?

Most of the kludge comes from the fact that I can't use CGI's or anything,
so it's all client side stuff.  Basically three types, a scan, inc and show 
mappings to .show, .inc, .scan, and then application types that take a scan,
inc, or show, and html-ize the output, and then SIGUSR1 Mosaic.

Please don't flame me for this, I know it's awful, but it's just a project
and if I can't do it without tons of dumy files, I'm not going to use it at 
all.

I see this would reduce the httpd header parsing somewhat and allow for
batched object requests, but:

1. How does the client receive unsolicited and/or solicited, but delayed
objects ?  Does the client have an fhttpd object server as well, or do
you keep the command TCP connection alive for all transactions (ala FTP) ?

2. Which end "looks-ahead" ?  Does the fhttpd scan the requested objects
for possibilities or does the client batch up requests ?

In some previous articles on this list ("object oriented data models and
client side CGI" and "PROPOSAL: "W3A" - a client-side applets API"), Dan
Connolly (connolly@hal.com) has mentioned WINTERP 2.0 as an alternative to
Tcl/Tk or Python as a development/delivery/extensibility environment for
WWW applications. WINTERP -- the OSF/Motif Widget INTERPreter -- is an
interactive, extensible, object-oriented environment for creating GUI-based
applications (OSF/Motif) and features powerful new object-oriented 2.5D
graphics and animation capabilities (Xtango). WINTERP 2.0 was recently
released on the X Consortium X11r6 "contrib" distribution and is freely
available by anonymous ftp.

Due to lack of time, I haven't had an opportunity to post my opinions on
WINTERP 2.0's advantages over Python or Tcl/Tk for doing client-side
processing and on-the-fly-contruction of UIs. Given that I'm soon leaving
town on vacation, I now really don't have time...

Instead, I figured I'd take the opportunity to give you all a pointer to
the WINTERP 2.0 world-wide-web home page. While you're at it, you may be
interested in checking out a paper describing EIT's WWW Authoring
Environment, which is built on top of WINTERP 2.0 --
	http://www.eit.com/papers/gpware94/paper.html.
See the figures in this paper for some examples of UIs built in WINTERP 2.0.

Subject: http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterp.html (WINTERP home page)
Distribution: inet

For those of you with World Wide Web browsers (e.g. Mosaic), I've just
created a home page for WINTERP 2.0 (OSF/Motif Widget INTERPreter). WINTERP
is a rapid prototyping, development and delivery environment for GUI-based
applications on Unix platforms. WINTERP fills the same needs as TCL/TK or
Python (or the windowing korn shell) but:
(0) Provides a complete, object-oriented user-interface toolkit based on
    the standard OSF/Motif widget set and the X toolkit.
(1) Uses a small, portable object-oriented Lisp interpreter
    (an event-driven version of Betz/Almy/Tierney-et-al's XLISP-PLUS).
(2) Other applications may send programmatic commands to WINTERP's
    interpreter via unix domain or internet domain sockets.
(3) High-level object-oriented 2.5D graphics and animation based on
    Stasko and Hayes' Xtango path transition animation paradigm.
(4) nonblocking GUI interfaces to multiple asynchronous interactive Unix
    subprocess (based on Don Libes' expect library with WINTERP extensions).

Best of all, WINTERP 2.0 is a "one stop shopping" free application
environment -- the full system (C-source, documentation, example programs)
is available in one tar file -- you don't have to run around the net
integrating interpreter, interface and "accessory" packages. Just add Motif
1.2, Unix, a C compiler, berkeley networking facilities (unix domain
sockets), and X11r5 or X11r6...  compile, and you're good to go. The system
is quite portable -- so far, I know that WINTERP 2.0 works on Irix, Ultrix,
OSF1, SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, Linux, NeXT-Step (w/ Co-Xist Motif/X), etc.

Anyways... the home page is accessible via the following URL:
	http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterp.html
a copy of the page is also available from the X Consortium Ftp site:
	file://ftp.x.org/contrib/devel_tools/winterp.html

Expect this page to change/improve sometime after I return from vacation on
July 15. In particular, I plan to provide a HTML version of the WINTERP
documentation. And a page describing each of the WINTERP example
applications, with hypertext pointers to a screendump (GIF) of each
application and the code that created the screen. (Over 200 example
applications/UIs and test scripts are included with the WINTERP
distribution).
